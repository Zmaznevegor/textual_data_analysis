All dollar amounts in this prospectus are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. The following summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should read the entire prospectus before making an investment decision to purchase our common shares. Kid’s Book Writer Inc. Kid’s Book Writer Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a development stage company was created to offer a pure online service designed to offer kids / children an ability to create their own book. The process will be simple log on to the service, pick a theme and the software will offer several options, including different book templates, storylines, backgrounds, page sizes, and able to access artwork and / or upload their pictures and make it part of the storyline. More advanced options that will allow the customer an ability to have more control over the various aspects of the process. We are still in our development stage and plan on commencing business operations in spring 2009. We have not earned any revenues to date. We do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we have completed our website and are able to accept business. As of April 30, 2008, we had $40,097 cash on hand and $500 liabilities. Accordingly our working capital position as of April 30, 2008 was $39,597. Since our inception through April 30, 2008, we have incurred a net loss of $2,549. We attribute our net loss to having no revenues to offset our expenses and the professional fees related to the creation and operation of our business. Our fiscal year ended is April 30. We were incorporated on October 24, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our principal offices are located at 10324 Wadhurst Road, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Our telephone number is (780) 718-6603. The Offering Securities Being Offered Up to 2,650,000 shares of our common stock. Offering Price The offering price of the common stock is $0.01 per share. We intend to apply to the NASD Over-the-Counter BulletinBoard electronic quotation service to allow the trading of our common stock upon our becoming a reporting entity under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If our common stock becomes so traded and a market for the stock develops, the actual price of stock will be determined by prevailing market prices at the time of sale or by private transaction negotiated by the selling shareholders. The offering price would thus be determined by market factors and the independent decisions of the selling shareholders. 3 Minimum Number of Shares To Be Sold in This Offering None Securities Issued and to be Issued 5,750,000 shares of our common stock are issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. All of the common stock to be sold under this prospectus will be sold by existing shareholders and thus there will be no increase in our issued and outstanding shares as a result of this offering. The issuance to the selling shareholders was exempt due to the provisions of Regulation S. Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the selling shareholders. Summary Financial Information Balance Sheet Data April 30, 2008 (audited) Cash $ 40,097 Total Current Assets $ 40,097 Liabilities $ 500 Total Stockholder’s Equity $ 39,597 Statement of Loss and Deficit From Inception (October 24, 2007) to April 30, 2008 (audited) Revenue $ - Net Loss for the Period $ 2,549 Risk Factors An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related To Our Financial Condition and Business Model If we do not obtain additional financing, we will not be able to conduct our business operations to the extent that we become profitable Our current operating funds will cover the initial stages of our business plan; however, we currently do not have any operations and we have no income. Because of this and the fact that we will incur significant legal and accounting costs necessary to maintain a public corporation, we will require additional financing to complete our development activities. We currently do not have any 4 arrangements for financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. We believe the only source of funds that would be realistic is through a loan from our president and the sale of equity capital. Our Independent Auditor has indicated that he has substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, if true, you could lose your investment John Kinross-Kennedy, C.P.A., our independent auditor, has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our lack of operating history and the fact to date have had no revenues. Potential investors should be aware that there are difficulties associated with being a new venture, and the high rate of failure associated with this fact. We have incurred a net loss of $2,549 for the period from October 24, 2007 (inception) to April 30, 2008 and have had no revenues to date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from our website. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements included with this prospectus have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our auditor has made reference to the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in his audit report on our audited financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2008. If we are not able to achieve revenues, then we may not be able to continue as a going concern and our financial condition and business prospects will be adversely affected. Because we anticipate our operating expenses will increase prior to our earning revenues, we may never achieve profitability Prior to completion of our development stage, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from our business development, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we may not be able to generate any revenues or ever achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. Because our president has only agreed to provide his services on a part-time basis, he may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations, causing our business to fail Because we are in the development stage of our business, Mr. Phillet will not be spending a significant amount of time on our business. Mr. Phillet expects to expend approximately 20 hours per week on our business. Competing demands on Mr. Phillet's time may lead to a divergence between his interests and the interests of other shareholders. Mr. Phillet is in public practice as a Chartered Accountant and also owns and manages a number of privately-owned businesses by which he divides his time. None of the work he will be undertaking for these companies will directly compete with Kid’s Book Writer Inc. 5 Because our president owns approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock, investors may find that corporate decisions influenced by Mr. Phillet are inconsistent with the best interests of other stockholders Mr. Phillet is our president and sole director. He owns approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the date of this prospectus. Accordingly, he will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. While we have no current plans with regard to any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of its assets, the interests of Mr. Phillet may still differ from the interests of other stockholders. Mr. Phillet owns 3,100,000 common shares for which he paid $0.005 per share. Because our President and sole director is a Canadian Resident, difficulty may arise in attempting to effect service or process on him in Canada Because Mr. Phillet our sole director and officer, is a Canadian resident, difficulty may arise in attempting to effect service or process on him in Canada or in enforcing a judgment against Kid’s Book Writer Inc.’s assets located outside of the United States. The success of our business depends on the continued use and growth of the Internet as a commerce platform The existence and growth of our service depends on the continued acceptance of the Internet as a commerce platform for individuals and enterprises. The internet could possibly lose its viability as a tool to pay for online services by the adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility and quality of service. The acceptance and performance of the Internet has been harmed by “viruses,” “worms,” and “spy-ware”. If for some reason the Internet was no longer widely accepted as a tool to pay for online services, the demand for our service would be significantly reduced, which would harm or cause our business to fail. Because we will rely on a third-party for hosting and maintenance of our website, mismanagement or service interruptions could significantly harm our business Our website will be hosted and maintained by a third party hosting service. Any mismanagement, service interruptions, or damage to the data of our company or our customers, could result in the loss of customers, or other harm to our business. Because we face competition our business may fail Some of our competitors have long operating histories, greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. Because we face competition from other companies offering similar services, the current and possible increase in competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 6 Evolving regulation of the Internet may adversely affect us As Internet commerce continues to evolve there may be increased regulation by federal, state and/or foreign agencies. Any new regulations which restrict our business could harm or cause our business to fail. Risks Related To This Offering If a market for our common stock does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares There is currently no market for our common stock and a market may never develop. We currently plan to apply for listing of our common stock on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. However, our shares may never be traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service or, if traded, a public market may never materialize. If our common stock is not traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service or if a public market for our common stock does not develop, investors may not be able to re-sell the shares of our common stock that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment. If a market for our common stock develops, our stock price may be volatile If a market for our common stock develops, we anticipate that the market price of our common stock will be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including: the evolving demand for our service; our ability or inability to arrange for financing; our ability to manage expenses; changes in our pricing policies or our competitors; and global economic and political conditions. Further, if our common stock is traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service, our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If the selling shareholders sell a large number of shares all at once or in blocks, the market price of our shares would most likely decline The selling shareholders are offering 2,650,000 shares of our common stock through this prospectus. Our common stock is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange, but should a market develop, shares sold at a price below the current market price at which the common stock 7 is trading will cause that market price to decline. Moreover, the offer or sale of a large number of shares at any price may cause the market price to fall. Because our stock is a penny stock, shareholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their stock The shares offered by this prospectus constitute a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain classified as a penny stock for the foreseeable future. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer must provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer, and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market valu e of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules: the broker/dealer must make a special written determination that a penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of price fluctuations in the price of the stock and may reduce the level of trading activity in any secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules, and accordingly, investors in this offering may find it difficult to sell their securities, if at all. Forward-Looking Statements This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. The actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our actual results are most likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus. Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered through this prospectus by the selling shareholders. Determination of Offering Price The $0.01 per share offering price of our common stock was determined arbitrarily by us. There is no relationship whatsoever between this price and our assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. We intend to apply to the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service for the trading of our common stock upon our becoming a reporting entity under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). If our common stock becomes so traded and a market for the stock develops, the actual price of stock will be determined by prevailing 8 market prices at the time of sale or by private transactions negotiated by the selling shareholders named in this prospectus. The offering price would thus be determined by market factors and the independent decisions of the selling shareholders named in this prospectus. Dilution The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued and outstanding. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. Selling Shareholders The selling shareholders named in this prospectus are offering all of the 2,650,000 shares of common stock offered through this prospectus. The selling shareholders acquired the 2,650,000 shares of common stock offered through this prospectus from us at a price of $0.01 per share in an offering that was exempt from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and completed on March 31, 2008. We will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission prospectus supplements to specify the names of any successors to the selling shareholders specified in this registration statement who are able to use the prospectus included in this registration statement to resell the shares registered by this registration statement. The following table provides, as of the date of this prospectus, information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock held by each of the selling shareholders, including: 1. the number of shares owned by each prior to this offering; 2. the total number of shares that are to be offered by each; 3. the total number of shares that will be owned by each upon completion of the offering; 4. the percentage owned by each upon completion of the offering; and 5. the identity of the beneficial holder of any entity that owns the shares.

The numbers in this table assume that none of the selling shareholders sells shares of common stock not being offered in this prospectus or purchases additional shares of common stock, and assumes that all shares offered are sold. Other than Netta Phillet, the wife of Michael Frank Philet, and Michael D. Phillet, the son of Michael Frank Phillet our President, sole officer and director, none of the selling shareholders: (1) has had a material relationship with us other than as a shareholder at any time within the past three years; or (2) has ever been one of our officers or directors. Plan of Distribution The selling shareholders may sell some or all of their common stock in one or more transactions, including block transactions: 1. On such public markets as the common stock may from time to time be trading; 2. In privately negotiated transactions; 10 3. Through the writing of options on the common stock; 4. In short sales; or 5. In any combination of these methods of distribution. The sales price to the public is fixed at $0.01 per share until such time as the shares of our common stock are traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service. Although we intend to apply for trading of our common stock on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service, public trading of our common stock may never materialize. If our common stock becomes traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service, then the sales price to the public will vary according to the selling decisions of each selling shareholder and the market for our stock at the time of resale. In these circumstances, the sales price to the public may be: 1. The market price of our common stock prevailing at the time of sale; 2. A price related to such prevailing market price of our common stock; or 3. Such other price as the selling shareholders determine from time to time. The shares may also be sold in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rule 144. We can provide no assurance that all or any of the common stock offered will be sold by the selling shareholders named in this prospectus. We are bearing all costs relating to the registration of the common stock. The selling shareholders, however, will pay any commissions or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the common stock. The selling shareholders named in this prospectus must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in the offer and sale of the common stock. The selling shareholders and any broker-dealers who execute sales for the selling shareholders may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In particular, during such times as the selling shareholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and may, among other things: 1. Not engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our common stock; 2. Furnish each broker or dealer through which common stock may be offered, such copies of this prospectus, as amended from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer; and 3. Not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities other than as permitted under the Exchange Act. 11 Description of Securities General Our authorized capital stock consists of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share. As of June 25, 2008, there were 5,750,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding held by thirty five (35) stockholders of record. There are no preferred shares authorized or issued. Common Stock Our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. Except as otherwise required by law, the holders of our common stock will possess all voting power. Generally, all matters to be voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the case of election of directors, by a plurality) of the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of our common stock that are present in person or represented by proxy. Holders of our common stock representing thirty three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of our capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, are necessary to constitute a quorum at any meeting of our stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares is required to effectuate certain fundamental corporate changes such as liquidation, merger or an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation do not prov ide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. Holders of our common stock have no pre-emptive rights, no conversion rights and there are no redemption provisions applicable to our common stock. Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Pre-emptive Rights Holders of common stock are not entitled to pre-emptive or subscription or conversion rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are, and the shares of common stock offered hereby will be when issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Share Purchase Warrants We have not issued and do not have outstanding any warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. 12 Options We have not issued and do not have outstanding any options to purchase shares of our common stock. Convertible Securities We have not issued and do not have outstanding any securities convertible into shares of our common stock or any rights convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock. Nevada Anti-Takeover laws Nevada revised statutes sections 78.378 to 78.3793 provide state regulation over the acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation provide that the provisions of these sections do not apply. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not state that these provisions do not apply. The statute creates a number of restrictions on the ability of a person or entity to acquire control of a Nevada company by setting down certain rules of conduct and voting restrictions in any acquisition attempt, among other things. The statute is limited to corporations that are organized in the state of Nevada and that have 200 or more stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of the State of Nevada; and does business in the State of Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation. Because of these conditions, the statute does not apply to our company. Interests of Named Experts and Counsel No expert or counsel named in this prospectus as having prepared or certified any part of this prospectus or having given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered or upon other legal matters in connection with the registration or offering of the common stock was employed on a contingency basis, or had, or is to receive, in connection with the offering, a substantial interest, direct or indirect, in the registrant or any of its parents or subsidiaries.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Karen Batcher, our independent legal counsel, has provided an opinion on the validity of our common stock. 13 Description of Business In General Kid’s Book Writer Inc. was created to offer a pure online service designed to offer kids / children and parents an ability to create their own book.

Once the book is complete they will have several options for printing, including downloading the book as a pdf file (or other type) to be printed at home, have it emailed to a photo print shop such as Future Shop or WalMart (i.e. as one of their “Memory Books”). Kid’s Book Writer may also outsource this service and include it as a profit center for certain types of books. Key Design Considerations Although there are very few online publishing services that have kids in mind, Kid’s Book Writer will not be first to market. Clearly, the highly successful lulu.com has created a market-leading solution. It allows children to write a book  create characters, invent situations, and be in charge of everything that happens. Its offering is a collaboration of John Lithgow (actor and best-selling children’s book author), Knowledge Adventure®, and Lulu  to produce Knowledge Adventure Books by You. For $19.95, consumers can download software which allows people to follow along on their computer as the Knowledge Adventure audio and video clips guides them through a step-by-step process: Pick a storyline Make the story your own by answering John’s questions about the action, characters, names of places, etc. Read and edit each chapter as you go, maybe making changes when you get personalized writing tips Add your own cover photos or illustrations Dedicate it to someone special (like mom), if you want Create an “About the Author” page with information about someone else special: you Design a totally cool cover 14 Customers can print the book at home, save it as a PDF, or upload it to Lulu  where it can be professionally printed and bound as either a hardcover or paperback and shipped for fast arrival. It can be ordered as just one special copy or order extra copies as gifts to share relatives and / or envious friends. Additional resources include downloading art, writing tips, and parent resources (help your child become a better reader), expert advice (see how others are using Knowledge Adventure Books). Knowledge Adventure Books  Positives Knowledge Adventure Books  Limitations Offers a service for ages K-8 as well as for kids 8 and up. Ease of use & automated effectively. Good final product. Low, reasonable cost. Is high in search results (but this service is the only one of its type !) Lack of variety (“nice to see an easier book, for example”). Only four stories to select from. Process can be tedious (i.e. 100 questions per chapter). Is in large measure a subset of the much larger publishing site. There are very few services that appear to compete in the kids / children’s space. In a google search for “kids book writers” several sites were returned, none of which included a site such as lulu  rather the list was populated by children’s book authors / agents / illustrators and other resource-oriented services. Similarly, a search for “childrens book publishers” returned only iUniverse.com and lulu.com (both paid for results). iUniverse is very much oriented toward professional authors and does not offer a similar type of service to what lulu.com or kidsbookwriter.com will offer (i.e. their publishing packages start at $399.) Children’s Book Market The literary marketplace has always had three essential elements: 1) authorship, 2) publishing, and 3) audience, each of which continues to be shaped by market forces. The modern (i.e. post-war) era has been characterized by rapid technological development, mass production, and consumerism. Historically, the fact that the fixed costs of producing books was high (i.e. beyond the reach of individuals), combined with the fact that the profitability of any one title was highly uncertain, led to the development of well-capitalized publishers that were able to diversity their risk across many books. Since any one author needed a publisher more than that publisher needed any one author, publishing houses became large and powerful, with the industry generating multi-billion dollars in sales annually. Whereas book publishing had been the dominated by smaller houses that were operated by their owner operators, this began to change in 1959, when Random House went public and began to focu s attention on the book publishing industry. The 1970s saw a period of acquisition and consolidation and by 1982, more than 50% of all mass market sales were accounted for by 5 firms, and 10 publishing firms accounted for more than 85%. The rise of the chain bookstore has essentially ensured that publishing has been a relatively “closed” institution. 15 This began to change with the advent of modern digital technology  in particular “print on demand” technology, as well as computer programs that enable publishers to prepare books for printing entirely on computers. These two technologies served to greatly reduce the production costs for relatively small book runs, which has led to a rapid rise in the number of small scale publishers. As desktop publishing programs became more and more sophisticated, the once somewhat disrespected world of self-publishing began to blossom. Lower costs meant that more people could self-publish, and many companies hurried towards this opportunity, working with authors not willing to wait for traditional publication, or wanting more control over their book, or just wanting to get a family story in print. With the proliferation of the Internet and Internet-based technologies, even more changes have occurred. A number of firms have begun to bundle together a series of technologies that have tapped into all these trends and tapped into new, rich markets of printers ink. Market leader and 5 year old publish on demand www.lulu.com is an excellent example of this trend. According to a recent article in the UK Guardian ( www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/feb/20/useconomy.booksnews ), Lulu is doubling in size every year and that globally as many as 15,000 people register at its site each week, mostly to create books but also calendars, music and DVDs. Lulu has a faster growth rate than CEO Bob Young’s previous start-up, open-source software company Red Hat . Interesting and noteworthy statistics regarding lulu.com #1 Self Publishing Website (according to Alexa). 4,000 new titles each week published and a current catalogue of 232,000 books. Products from a million creators, 500,000 others who visit each week Books, artwork, CDs, DVDs, calendars, and all sorts of goodies. Books vary from paperback to hardcover to comics, etc. Distributes through 60,000 retailers, schools and libraries Has a marketing program which starts at $45. The programs are easy for just about anyone to use: Authors select basic options, including the book's size, binding style and paperback or hardcover. After the manuscript is uploaded, users go to a page where they select a font and design the book's cover. On-demand publishing is letting thousands realize the ambitions of generations of would-be writers. What makes self-publishing viable is the Internet. In the past, if an author created a book about some obscure topic, the audience would be limited. Now, the Internet gives writers instant access to audiences that share their same interests, no matter how obscure. Authors also use online communities such as blogs, MySpace.com and others to market their works. 16 The Spin-Off Effect - Non-Commercial Publishing The system also allows small businesses to print high-end brochures, screenwriters to shop their scripts around and others to assemble wedding, sporting event, vacations, and other special-event books for friends and family. For example, PictureSlide.com was launched in 2006, which allowed customers to upload their images and layout pages using free software, in turn creating a professionally printed "coffee table" style book. These photo books are often used to display pictures of virtually any topic. Importantly, this site was launched to overcome the limitations of other photo-oriented sites (i.e. difficult to use, uncertain quality of end product, layout options, sizes and styles of photo albums, etc.). The Market Opportunity Research shows that: The market for online self-publishing is becoming large, is increasingly becoming mainstream, and continues to grow rapidly. The great majority of new offerings are geared toward the adult market and self-published books  there are very few tailored to kids / children. Offerings are often mingled with other service / product offerings (i.e. CDs, DVDs, calendars, etc.). Other offerings have historically been software has been difficult to use, limited in the layout options, and time consuming to create. There are many “photo” oriented services (i.e. providing photo publishing and album type services) along with CD / DVD services, but very few true online publishing services geared to children. KidsBookWriter.com Service To summarize, research indicates that: There is very little online for kids to create their own book  lulu.com appears to be the only one and appears to have a good measure of success and response from the marketplace. The strategy  take advantage of the fact that there are almost no other similar services and become very good at providing this service. All trends favor continuing growth in this market  The strategy  provide an excellent service in this particular space. Lulu.com, while possessing many positives, also has some limited features  which Management intends to capitalize on in designing the kid’s book writer service. The strategy  incorporate the same positive attributes as the Lulu.com offering while improving on its negatives. 17 Thus, the Kid’s Book Writer website will have the following attributes: Simple . The website will be dedicated exclusively to kids, their book creations, and related services. The graphics and presentation of the website will in all cases be geared to children. Flexibility . While being “simple”, the site will also have options for different levels of difficulty. Whereas the lulu.com service appears to favor one basic approach (which can be tedious), kid’s book writer will offer different levels of “difficulty”  examples could include: A. A totally guided approach  almost little more than a basic picture book along with some text. This would be geared more toward a younger audience B. For return visitors or slightly older children, this would be more of an approach now followed by Lulu’s Knowledge Adventure Books  a guided tour but will many options and help on what needs to be done next in the book. As one point of departure, however, as opposed to lulu’s Knowledge Adventure Books, Kid’s Book Writer will offer far more than 4 basic stories to make. C. For “advanced” users, Kid’s Book Writer will begin to depart from the guided, interactive approach and begin to have the look and feel of a traditional software program  for example, icons related to backgrounds, pictures, layout options, etc. A much less “guided” approach will be followed. However, the major point of departure might be a help options on how to use each of the various icons, help of what is missing from the book, etc. Kid’s Book Writer will attempt to make this as “intelligent” as possible. Pricing . Kid’s Book Writer will have a similar, low cost fee schedule as the lulu.com service. Related Services . Kid’s Book Writer will offer as many other services as possible. For example, a help feature, FAQ, writing tips, artwork and backgrounds, as well as ideas on how to create more advanced books and layout features. These are only a few ideas  the intent of Management is to offer its paying customers the most resources available so as to create and maintain a competitive advantage. Search . Kid’s Book Writer will attempt to initiate the most modern, current search strategy available so that users will be given the opportunity to be compared with the lulu.com service and make an informed decision. End Product . As with other types of services, the range of printing options available will be as broad as possible, with virtually every type of size and binding planned to be available. Software Protection The software that customers used will not be “stand alone” (i.e. they will not be able to complete their book on their own, without accessing the website). Rather, it is currently envisioned that 18 customers can download the software and see the various options available. However, to create and access all their stored files (i.e. the “book”), they must sign in online and pay a small fee to get their own book started. Each customer (login name) will have the ability to gain access to one project. Thus, the software can be transferred among family and friends, but each book must be paid for separately. Repeat visitors may be given discounts on future books to encourage repeat business. Other options, such as family plans, may be considered (i.e. one username, several projects). Sales and Marketing The Kid’s Book Writer services will not only be a pure online business, it will represent somewhat of a niche service. Accordingly, Management believes that a highly targeted Internet marketing strategy must be implemented. This will be accomplished through implementing a range of marketing techniques. Kid’s Book Writer will develop its internet web-site  to date, Kids Book Writer has reserved its domain name. Most importantly, development of a state of the art “search” strategy, to direct potential users to the website. This may include utilizing various forms of “paid for” internet advertising, depending on funding and other considerations. Pursuing a variety of public relations activities, including media articles. This may also include attempting to gain the endorsements of the various online communities related to children (i.e. Children's Technology Review, Web 2.0 Awards, The National Parenting Center, Parenting Magazine, etc.). Development of a list of potential industry partners to establish links with and gaining links and listings with the various publishing directories Employees We have no employees as of the date of this prospectus other than our president. We conduct our business largely through the outsourcing of experts in each particular area of our business. Research and Development Expenditures We have not incurred any material research or development expenditures since our incorporation. Subsidiaries We do not currently have any subsidiaries. Patents and Trademarks We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark. 19 Office Property We maintain our executive office at 10324 Wadhurst Road, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T5N 3V1. This office space is being provided to the company free of charge by our president, Mr. Phillet. This arrangement provides us with the office space necessary at this point. Upon significant growth of the company it may become necessary to lease or acquire additional or alternative space to accommodate our development activities and growth. Legal Proceedings We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings. Our agent for service of process in Nevada is Nevada Agency and Trust Company, 50 West Liberty Street, Suite 880, Reno, Nevada 89501. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters No Public Market for Common Stock There is presently no public market for our common stock. We anticipate making an application for trading of our common stock on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. However, we can provide no assurance that our shares will be traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board electronic quotation service or, if traded, that a public market will materialize. The Securities Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities' laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for 20 such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitably statement. Kid’s Book Writer Inc. is subject to the penny stock rules, and disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock and stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities. Holders of Our Common Stock As of the date of this Registration Statement, we had thirty five (35) shareholders of record. Rule 144 Shares None of our common stock is currently available for resale to the public under Rule 144. In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who has beneficially owned shares of a company's common stock for at least 180 days is entitled to sell his or her shares. However, Rule 144 is not available to shareholders for at least one year subsequent to an issuer that previously met the definition of Rule 144(i)(1)(i) having publicly filed, on Form 8K, the information required by Form 10. As of the date of this prospectus, no selling shareholder has held their shares for more than 180 days and it has not been at least one year since the company filed the Form 10 Information on Form 8K as contemplated by Rule 144(i)(2) and (3). Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about the company. Stock Option Grants To date, we have not granted any stock options. Registration Rights We have not granted registration rights to the selling shareholders or to any other persons. We are paying the expenses of the offering because we seek to: (i) become a reporting company with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (ii) enable our common stock to be traded on the NASD over-the-counter bulletin board. We plan to file a Form 8-A registration statement with the Commission to cause us to become a reporting company with the Commission under the 1934 Act. We must be a reporting company under the 1934 Act in order that our common stock is eligible for trading on the NASD over-the-counter bulletin board. We believe that the registration of the resale of shares on behalf of existing shareholders may facilitate the development 21 of a public market in our common stock if our common stock is approved for trading on a recognized market for the trading of securities in the United States. We consider that the development of a public market for our common stock will make an investment in our common stock more attractive to future investors. In the near future, in order for us to continue with our mineral exploration program, we will need to raise additional capital. We believe that obtaining reporting company status under the 1934 Act and trading on the OTCBB should increase our ability to raise these additional funds from investors. 22 Financial Statements Index to Financial Statements: Audited consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2008, including: 24 Auditors’ Report 25 Balance Sheet 26 Statement of Operations 27 Statement of Stockholders’ Equity 28 Statement of Cash Flows 29-32 Notes to Financial Statements 23 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To: The Board of Directors and Shareholders Kids Book Writer Inc. Reno, Nevada I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Kids Book Writer Inc. as of April 30, 2008 and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the period then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered an initial loss and has not yet commenced operations. This raises substantive doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. In my opinion, based on my audit, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kids Book Writer Inc. as of April 30, 2008 and the results of its operations, its stockholders’ equity and its cash flows for the period ended April 30 2008, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of the effectiveness of its documented internal controls over financial reporting.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Period ended April 30, 2008 NOTE 1 - BUSINESS AND CONTINUED OPERATIONS Kids Book Writer Inc. was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 24, 2007. The Company was formed for the purpose of engaging in all lawful businesses. The Company’s authorized capital consisted of 75,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common voting stock. The financial statements presented include all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Current Business of the Company The Company had no material business operations from inception October 24, 2007 to April; 30, 2008. The company formed plans to offer an on-line resource for self-publishing books on family occasions. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cash and equivalents Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 107, “Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments.” SFAS No. 107 requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments when it is practicable to estimate that value. The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments as of March 31, 2008 approximate their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Such instruments consist of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The fair value of related party payables is not determinable. Income Taxes The Company utilizes SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 29 applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company generated deferred tax credits through net operating loss carryforwards. However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been established, as the realization of the deferred tax credits is not reasonably certain, based on going concern considerations outlined below. Going Concern The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an initial operating loss of $2,549. The Company had a positive cash flow of $40,097, from the sale of stock in the period ended April 30, 2008. The company has a shareholders’ equity of $39,597 at April 30, 2008. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations. In order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of common stock. In the interim, shareholders of the Company are committed to meeting its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Development-Stage Company The Company is considered a development-stage company, having no operating revenues during the period presented, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 7. SFAS No. 7 requires companies to report their operations, shareholders deficit and cash flows since inception through the date that revenues are generated from management’s intended operations, among other things. Management has defined inception as October 24, 2007. Since inception, the Company has incurred an operating loss of $2,549, much of which related to consultants, as a means to generate working capital. The Company’s working capital has been generated through the sales of common stock. Management has provided financial data since October 24, 2007 “Inception” in the financial statements, as a means to provide readers of the Company’s financial information to make informed investment decisions. 30 Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 “Earnings Per Share” requires presentation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic income (loss) per share (“Basic EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share (“Diluted EPS”) is similarly calculated using the treasury stock method except that the denominator is increased to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if dilutive securities at the end of the applicable period were exercised. There were no potential dilutive securities for the period ended Aprilo 30, 2008. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the period ended April 30, 2008. Numerato r: Basic and diluted net loss per share: Net Income (Loss) $ ( 2,549) Denominator Basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 3,425,926 Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share $ 0.001 NOTE 3  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On December 13, 2007 the President and C.E.O., Michael F. Phillet, purchased 3,100,000 shares of common stock of the Company at $0.005 per share. NOTE 4 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES There were no commitments or contingencies in the three months ended April 30, 2008. 31 NOTE 5  CAPITAL STOCK TRANSACTIONS On December 13, 2007, 3,100,000 shares were issued for cash at $0.005 per share. In January, 2008, 1,400,000 shares were issued for cash at $0.01 per share. In February, 2008, 1,050,000 shares were issued for cash at $0.01 per share. In March, 2008, 200,000 shares were issued for cash at $0.01 per share. At April 30, 2008 the Company had authorized 75,000,000 common shares, of which the total issued and outstanding was 5,750,000. NOTE 6  LITIGATION There were no legal proceedings against the Company with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Neither the Company nor any of its officers or directors is involved in any other litigation either as plaintiffs or defendants, and have no knowledge of any threatened or pending litigation against them or any of the officers or directors. 32 Plan of Operations The intent of Management is to create a unique, simple, effective, value-based system that has instant appeal to users. It will not only be an invaluable learning tool, it will represent a fun way for children to put their pictures and written content into an end product that will make family proud and friends want to do the same. This will all be available at very low cost. It will be a totally online, automated system with no need for a large staff. Creating the Website The process of creating the Kids Book Writer website is expected to be as follows: Working with its web designer, decide on the various graphics, layout options, and content on the home page and other pages. Conduct additional research on printing options and secure relationships or incorporate links / options on the website. As one example, links to WalMart’s online “Memory Book” service. Assemble the considerable amount of content that must be available on the site. Incorporate ecommerce ability on the website. Create an effective “search” strategy. Test market the site with children of various ages. Launch the site. This process is expected to have a budget of approximately $30,000 and take 9 to 12 months. The company expects to have the website operational in spring of 2009. The company currently believes it has sufficient funding to conduct the construction of its website. Following completion of the website Following this initial phase, ongoing efforts are expected to be geared to the following activities: Monitoring results and making changes / adjustments as appropriate. Continuing to institute marketing enhancements. Where appropriate and advisable, bring additional, closely related products to the website. Creating of additional websites, written in foreign languages. The President of Kids Book Writer, M. Frank Phillet, will spearhead this effort. Due to the nature of the costs involved and the fact that M. Frank Phillet will not be receiving a salary at this time, expenses related to this ongoing effort are expected to be less than $10,000. The company also expects to be generating revenue from the website at this time. If Kids Book Writer experiences a considerable degree of financial success, additional marketing and other expenses may be incurred to further broaden the reach of the business, which may involve 33 hiring one or more additional staff to handle increased demands, site monitoring, and customer support. There may be additional demands placed on the company for website development and the need to broaden the management team. Depending on availability of funds and the opportunities available to the Company, Kids Book Writer may also hire additional marketing personnel to access additional sales and distribution channels. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Results of Operations for Fiscal Year Ending April 30, 2008 We did not earn any revenues from inception through the period ending April 30, 2008. We do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we have begun operations on our website. We are presently in the start-up phase of our business and we can provide no assurance that we will attain sufficient business on our website to attain profitability. We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $2,549 from inception on October 24, 2007 through the period ended April 30, 2008. These operating expenses included the research and the preparation of our business plan in addition to administrative expenses. We anticipate our operating expenses will increase as we undertake our plan of operations. The increase will be attributed to costs associated with setting up and maintaining our website, and the professional fees to be incurred in connection with the filing of a registration statement with the Securities Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. We anticipate our ongoing operating expenses will also increase once we become a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of April 30, 2008, we had cash of $40,097 and operating capital of $39,597. We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue significant exploration activities beyond those planned for the current fiscal year. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants We have had no changes in or disagreements with our accountants. 34 Directors, Executive Officers, Promoters And Control Persons Our executive officers and directors and their respective ages as of June 25, 2008 are as follows: Name Age Position(s) and Office(s) Held Michael Frank Phillet 61 President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director Set forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of each of our current executive officers and directors.

Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis The Company presently not does have employment agreements with any of its named executive officers and it has not established a system of executive compensation or any fixed policies 35 regarding compensation of executive officers. Due to financial constraints typical of those faced by a development stage business, the company has not paid any cash and/or stock compensation to its named executive officers. Our current named executive officer holds substantial ownership in the Company and is motivated by a strong entrepreneurial interest in developing our operations and potential revenue base to the best of his ability. As our business and operations expand and mature, we may develop a formal system of compensation designed to attract, retain and motivate talented executives Summary Compensation Table The table below summarizes all compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to each named executive officer for our last two completed fiscal years for all services rendered to us.

Title of class Name and address of beneficial owner Amount of beneficial ownership Percent of class* Common Michael Phillet 10324 Wadhurst Road Edmonton, AB T5N 3V1 3,100,000 53.91% Common Total all executive officers and directors 3,100,000 53.91% Common 5% Shareholders None As used in this table, "beneficial ownership" means the sole or shared power to vote, or to direct the voting of, a security, or the sole or shared investment power with respect to a security (i.e., the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, a security). In addition, for purposes of this table, a person is deemed, as of any date, to have "beneficial ownership" of any security that such person has the right to acquire within 60 days after such date. The persons named above have full voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a person (or group of persons) is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if he or she, directly or indirectly, has or shares the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. Accordingly, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has the right to acquire within 60 days, such as options or warrants to purchase our common stock. Disclosure of Commission Position of Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities In accordance with the provisions in our articles of incorporation, we will indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by law. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion 38 of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Our bylaws provide that no advance shall be made by us to an officer of the company, except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the company in which event this paragraph shall not apply, in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made: (a) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (b) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company.
