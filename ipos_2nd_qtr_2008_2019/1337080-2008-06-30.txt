We have generated revenue from the sale of irrigation water and surplus real estate. We have obtained $4,750,000 in cash from eight investors and acquired title to certain material assets. One of the assets we acquired was a canal. In order to supply the development of agricultural property in Riverside County, four canals were constructed to transport water from San Bernardino to Riverside counties, California. Three of the four canals are now owned by cities and municipalities and operated to supply their water. We own the remaining canal. Our corporate offices are located at 25 Orchard Road, Lake Forest, California 92630. Our registered office is located at 6100 Neil Road, Suite 500, Reno, Nevada 89511. The offering We are registering 3,800,000 shares of common stock for sale by existing stockholders listed in the sections of this prospectus entitled " Selling Stockholders," and 4,248,000 shares of common stock for sale upon the exercise of outstanding warrants by existing warrant holders listed in the sections of this prospectus entitled " Selling Stockholders." We refer to these existing stockholders and warrantholders as the selling stockholders. All of the common stock registered by this prospectus will be sold by the selling stockholders at the prevailing market prices at the time they are sold. We currently have 19,193,300 shares of common stock outstanding, and if all of our outstanding warrants are exercised, we will have 23,441,300 shares of common stock outstanding.

Risks associated with EMPIRE WATER CORPORATION Need for substantial additional capital. We are in need of substantial additional capital, without which our ability to continue as a going concern will be jeopardized. In order to fund our ongoing, day-to-day operations, as well as to develop the West Riverside Canal (the Canal) and water resources, we will continue to require significant amounts of additional capital, and the failure to obtain such additional capital will materially adversely affect our operations. In order to fully implement our plan of operation, it will be necessary to raise at least an additional $16,000,000. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital. If we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock, you could experience significant dilution. If we are unsuccessful in raising such additional capital, you could lose your entire investment. Our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. Our proposed expenses are expected to increase as a result of complying with environmental laws and regulations. We also could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations. -6- Our planned water operations will be subject to extensive United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. These requirements include the United States Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, or the Safe Drinking Water Act, and similar state laws and regulations. We will also be required to obtain various environmental permits from state and other regulatory agencies for our operations. If we deliver water to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality laws and regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs or damage to our reputation. In the most serious cases, regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another entity, utility or municipality. Given the nature of our proposed business which, in part , will involve supplying water for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of, environmental laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to an issuer not similarly involved in the water industry. We will incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws and regulations and other health and safety and water quality laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, have tended to become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates, there can be no guarantee that the various state or similar regulatory bodies that govern our businesses would approve rate increases to recover such costs or that such costs will not adversely and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. We may also incur liabilities under environmental laws and re gulations requiring us to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties or at off-site locations where we have disposed of waste or caused adverse environmental impacts. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Such remediation losses may not be covered by our insurance policies and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. Changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control can significantly affect our business and results of operations. Any governmental entity that regulates our operations may enact new legislation or adopt new laws and regulations or policies at any time, and new judicial decisions may change the interpretation of existing legislation or regulations at any time. The individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees. Therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or changes in agency policy, including as a response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways, including the following: $ changing water quality or delivery service standards, treatment and discharge standards $ with which we must comply; $ restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for $ services previously provided; $ restricting our ability to sell assets or issue debt or equity securities; $ changing regulatory benefits that we expected to receive when we began offering -7- $ services in a particular area; $ changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to $ any concentration of ownership of our common stock; $ making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via $ eminent domain; and $ restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or $ aquifers. Any of these changes or any other changes in laws, regulations, judicial decisions or agency policies applicable to us may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Weather conditions, natural hazards, overuse of water supplies and competing uses may interfere with our sources of water, demand for water services and our ability to supply water to customers. Our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. We anticipate that most of the water that we will be transporting or treating will come from groundwater aquifers. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Governmental restrictions on water use during drought conditions may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible in our intended service area. Following drought conditions, water demand may not return to pre-drought levels even after restrictions are lifted. Cool and wet weather may also reduce demand f or water, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible in our intended service area. These include earthquakes, high water conditions and severe electrical storms. These weather events may affect the condition or operability of our facilities, limiting or preventing us from delivering water services to our customers. Any interruption in our ability to supply water or to collect, treat and properly dispose of waste, or any costs associated with restoring service, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Risks associated with water treatment may impose significant costs; contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries to civil or criminal enforcement actions, private litigation and clean-up obligations. One component of our proposed business plan involves treating nonpotable water, which can result in the creation of waste. If collection or industrial sewage systems fail, overflow or do not operate properly, untreated waste or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages, which may not be recoverable in rates. Liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow, our losses might not be covered by insurance policies (if such policies are in place at all), and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. Although we have not conducted any environmental analysis of the water sources that we intend to use, these water supplies are very likely -8- to be subject to contamination, including contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, such as nitrates, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), and possible terrorist attacks. In the event that our water supply is contaminated, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and our reputation may be adversely affected. We might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates, or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort or other lawsuits or criminal enforcement actions or other consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our reliance on third-party suppliers and service providers poses significant risks to our business and prospects. We intend to contract with third parties for goods and services that will be essential to our operations, such as maintenance and operation services, pipes, electricity and other materials. We have also agreed to enter into a water services agreement with Basin Water, Inc. If the scope of services or pricing of this agreement are not commercially reasonable, we may incur additional costs. Further, we will be subject to substantial risks because of our reliance on other suppliers and service providers. For example: $ our suppliers may not provide raw materials that meet our specifications in sufficient $ quantities; $ our service providers may fail to properly operate the Canal or the treatment facilities; $ our suppliers and service providers may face production delays due to natural disasters $ or strikes, lock-outs or other such actions; $ one or more suppliers or service providers could make strategic changes in the lines of $ products and services they offer; and $ some of our suppliers will be small companies which are more likely to experience $ financial and operational difficulties than larger, well-established companies, because of their limited financial and other resources. As a result of any of these factors, we may be required to find alternative suppliers for the raw materials and services on which we rely. Accordingly, we may experience delays in obtaining appropriate raw materials and services on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities from such alternative suppliers at a reasonable price, which could interrupt services to our customers and adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. The assets of the Canal property are subject to potential condemnation through eminent domain. Municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water services in the United States, and organized movements may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our business is expected to operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through the governmental power of eminent domain. Should a municipality or other government subdivision seek to acquire the Canal or other assets through eminent domain, we may resist the acquisition. Contesting an exercise of condemnation through -9- eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management from the operation of its business, and there can be no assurances that such efforts will be successful. If the Canal is condemned, the price paid for it could be much less than the aggregate paid for our shares, and our operations will discontinue as a going concern. Title to the Canal property may be defective which could materially limit or prevent our rights to use and develop the Canal . Title to the Canal was held by the a group (the West Riverside Sellers) pursuant to a deed recorded in 1916 and transferred to us by quit claim deed. Our rights to use significant portions of the Canal (the extent of which is currently unknown) may be limited to those of an easement holder, rather than a fee simple owner. We have made no independent effort to determine whether there may be significant encroachments on the Canal (although we are aware of some encroachments, the full extent of them are not presently known), or whether third parties may have vested rights to continue to occupy and use the Canal under claims of adverse possession or other prescriptive claims. Upon the transfer of ownership of the Canal, third parties claiming the right to continue to occupy and/or use the Canal may undertake legal action against us to seek enforcement of such rights, and we may be required to undert ake legal action to evict third parties from the Canal, all of which may result in considerable expense. Efforts to obtain title insurance for the Canal property (which might have revealed certain adverse claims) have been unsuccessful, and we have been advised that no title policy can be obtained, if at all, until a record of survey has been completed for the entire Canal and approved by local governmental authorities, which will be expensive and time consuming. We have started the survey and even if a title policy is ultimately obtained, it may not reveal all encroachments or prescriptive claims, and it may contain a number of disclaimers, exceptions, and exemptions limiting the title company = s liability under the policy. As a result, we are likely to incur substantial costs for the record of survey and other curative title work, and there can be no assurances that w e will ever obtain clear, unencumbered title to the Canal. If we cannot obtain clear title to the Canal, or if we are unable to obtain clear title to critical portions of the Canal that carry water between the source of water and the end users, our ability to raise further capital, develop the Canal, and use substantial portions, will be materially adversely affected. Taxes on the Canal property may not have been paid. The West Riverside Sellers have advised us that significant portions of the Canal and certain equipment and other improvements erected on the Canal have not been assessed for real and personal property tax purposes. Additionally, the real property comprising the Canal has not been assessed by the California State Board of Equalization (" BOE" ) as may be mandated under applicable law, and if assessed by the BOE, such assessments will not be subject to Article 13A of the California Constitution (Proposition 13), which means that the taxes on the Canal could be increased significantly on a year-to-year basis. Further, the West Riverside Sellers cannot confirm that all taxes have been paid on the entire Canal, nor can they confirm that such taxes have been paid to the prop er taxing authority. As a result, (i) there could be significant tax penalties applicable to the Canal, (ii) claims of adverse possession by other parties claiming an ownership interest in portions of the Canal could be strengthened, and (iii) if taxes owed with respect to the Canal are not paid once due, the taxing authorities may place a lien on the Canal and the fixtures and improvements located thereon to secure payment of past and future taxes. -10- Portions of the Canal are inoperative. Substantial portions of the Canal are not currently being operated and may not be made operational without installing pipelines, at significant cost and expense. Installing pipelines and other equipment will require obtaining permits and approvals from local governmental authorities, which could result in additional delays and costs, and to the extent such permits or approvals are discretionary on behalf of the governmental authorities, there is no guarantee that we can obtain such permits and approvals. Additionally, the West Riverside Sellers have informed us that a portion of one of two tunnels through which the Canal runs has collapsed, and may not be made serviceable again. If we are unable to utilize significant portions of the Canal, our ability to fully implement our business plan will be materially adversely affected. We have conducted limited due diligence and are presently unable to identify environmental and other liabilities associated with the Canal property. We have conducted very little due diligence regarding the Canal and the other assets acquired. The acquisition of the Canal properties was inexact and inherently uncertain as a result of the age of the original conveyances and other factors. We have assumed the risk of the physical condition of the Canal property, including but not limited to environmental issues, including but not limited to soils contamination, accumulated waste, etc. The West Riverside Sellers have not obtained any " Phase I" or " Phase II" environmental site assessments, or any other environmental reports regarding the Canal. We have retained a firm to conduct a Phase I environmental site assessment. The costs of any environmental cleanup could be very substantial. The nature of the water rights acquired from the West Riverside Sellers is uncertain. The groundwater rights acquired are governed by a court judgment, where the amount of groundwater pumped out of a groundwater basin exceeds the amount of water that is naturally recharged by rainfall or other means. In these types of cases, the court allocates the amount of groundwater each user can pump in order to ensure that the groundwater supply is not depleted in the long-term. The court judgment governing West Riverside 350 Inch Water Company, a California corporation or 350IWC = s water supply clearly defines the amount of groundwater certain " named parties" can pump from the San Bernardino Basin. 350IWC is not specifically a " named party" to the judgment, however, it is recognized as a groundwater user that pumps groundwater for use on non-overlying land. Because 350IWC is not a named party, its right to pump groundwater is established as a collective right along with all other non-parties who collectively pump groundwater for use on non-overlying land. As such, it is unclear precisely what the nature of those rights are as the court judgment pertains primarily to named parties. It is also unclear to what extent those rights can be increased beyond the amount of water which the West Riverside Sellers currently pump. Because the court retains jurisdiction over the court judgment, if groundwater pumping dramatically increases and some oth er groundwater user is " materially harmed" the court may be asked to modify or amend the judgment. If this occurs, there is the possibility we may need to obtain additional water rights from some other source to pump groundwater to the extent the water rights acquired from the West Riverside Sellers are insufficient. We also may need to undertake or defend against legal actions to perfect our interest in the water rights being acquired from the West Riverside Sellers. Such -11- limitations and deficiencies with respect to the water rights could materially limit or prevent us from raising further capital, developing the Canal, or using portions of the Canal. The purchase of the Water Treatment Unit may not be on an arms-length basis, or on commercially reasonable terms. The purchase of a water treatment facility (the Water Treatment Unit) was not the result of extensive negotiation among the parties, and was not the result of competitive bidding. Also, the seller of the Water Treatment Unit is an affiliate of Basin Water Resources, Inc. (BWRI). Although the price paid for such Water Treatment Unit is within the range customarily charged by the seller for similar products, the procurement process and pricing was not a result of competitive bidding and better prices for similar products may be available. Lack of corporate formalities; p otential m inority shareholder claims. West Riverside Canal Company or WRCC and 350IWC have been in existence since 1899 and 1916, respectively. Consequently, their corporate records are incomplete and the West Riverside Sellers cannot represent that all corporate formalities have been observed over the years, including but not limited to proper meetings of their boards of directors and shareholders. As such, WRCC and 350IWC are not certain as to the identities of all shareholders and have relied upon public notice to inform unknown shareholders of recent events. Further, at least one minority shareholder has raised claims regarding his ownership of shares of and interest in the West Riverside Sellers. As a result, although we purchased assets from the West Riverside Sellers, no assurances can be made that we will not be named in any claim made by such persons. If we are named in any litigation or other claim, the costs of defending such claims may be significant. Defending against such claims could be costly and require us to offer to refund the purchase price. We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Development, production and sale of water in the United States are subject to extensive laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include, among other things, construction and discharge permits for drilling and pipeline installation operations. Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Accordingly, any of these liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. -12- Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning there is substantial uncertainty whether we will continue operations. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion in their report dated September 24, 2007. This means that, as of the time of the opinion, there was substantial doubt that we could continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. Because there is an extremely limited public trading market for our common stock, you may not be able to resell your stock . There is currently an extremely limited public trading market for our common stock, and there may never be a broad public trading market. Therefore, investors may not be able to resell their common stock. USE OF PROCEEDS We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock in this offering. All proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock will be received by the selling shareholders. We will receive $5,310,000 if 4,248,000 warrants are exercised at $1.25. If the warrants are exercised, we would use the $5,310,000 for working capital. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The selling shareholders are offering their securities for sale in this offering. Their shares will be sold at the market price. No shares are being offered by us. Our shares are traded on the Bulletin Board operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). under the symbol "EWCR." DILUTION Since all of the shares of common stock being registered are already issued and outstanding, no dilution will result from this offering. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION; TERMS OF THE OFFERING There are nine selling shareholders. They may be deemed underwriters. They may sell some or all of their common stock in one or more transactions, including block transactions: * On such public markets or exchanges as the common stock may from time to time be trading; * In privately negotiated transactions; * Through the writing of options on the common stock; * In short sales; or -13- * In any combination of these methods of distribution. The sales price to the public will vary according to the selling decisions of each selling shareholder and the market for our stock at the time of resale. In these circumstances, the sales price to the public may be: * The market price of our common stock prevailing at the time of sale; * A price related to such prevailing market price of our common stock; or * Such other price as the selling shareholders determine from time to time. The shares may also be sold in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Securities Act. The selling shareholders may also sell their shares directly to market makers acting as principals or brokers or dealers, who may act as agent or acquire the common stock as a principal. Any broker or dealer participating in such transactions as agent may receive a commission from the selling shareholders, or, if they act as agent for the purchaser of such common stock, from such purchaser. The selling shareholders will likely pay the usual and customary brokerage fees for such services. Brokers or dealers may agree with the selling shareholders to sell a specified number of shares at a stipulated price per share and, to the extent such broker or dealer is unable to do so acting as agent for the selling shareholders, to purchase, as principal, any unsold shares at the price required to fulfill the respective broker's or dealer's commitment to the selling shareholders. Brokers or dealers who acquire shares as principals may thereafter resell such shares from time to time in transactions in a market or on an exchange, in negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices, and in connection with such re-sales may pay or receive commissions to or from the purchasers of such shares. These transactions may involve cross and block transactions that may involve sales to and through other brokers or dealers. We can provide no assurance that all or any of the common stock offered will be sold by the selling shareholders. We are bearing all costs relating to the registration of the common stock, estimated to be $40,000. The selling shareholders, however, will pay commissions or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the common stock. The selling shareholders must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the offer and sale of the common stock. In particular, during such times as the selling shareholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and may, among other things: 1. Not engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our common stock; 2. Furnish each broker or dealer through which common stock may be offered, such as copies of this prospectus, as amended from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer; and 3. Not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities other than as permitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. -14- There is no assurance that any of the selling shareholders will sell any or all of the shares offered by them. Under the securities laws of certain states, the shares may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in certain states the shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in that state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is met.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. We are a start-up corporation even though we were incorporated on May 18, 2005 as a consulting business to provide services to corporate executives. In December 2007, we decided to change our business focus to engage in the business of the ownership, development and sale of water resources. We have not yet generated or realized any significant revenues from our business operations. In December 2007 and January 2008 we received $4,000,000 through the sale of common stock and warrants and used a portion of the money to acquire title to certain material assets. One of the assets we acquired was a canal. In June 2008, we received an additional $750,000 through the sale of additional common stock and warrants. We are no longer a shell corporation. In order to supply the development of agricultural property in Riverside County, four canals were constructed to transport water from San Bernardino to Riverside. Three of the four canals are now owned by cities and municipalities and operated to supply their water. We own the remaining canal (the A Canal @ ). In their audit report dated September 24, 2007, our auditors issued a going concern opinion. This means that there was substantial doubt that we could continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtained additional capital. With the $4,750,000 we obtained, we believe we can operate for at least one year. In order to fully implement our plan of operation, it will be necessary to raise at least an additional $16,000,000. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to raise the additional capital we need to implement our plan of operation. -16- Plan of Operation Our plan of operation for the next twelve months calls for us to: * Raise an additional $16,000,000. * Commence a record of survey regarding the Canal. * Commence the process to perfect title in the Canal. * Begin expanding production and distribution . * Increase the amount of water produced. * Complete Phase I Environmental Review Limited operating history; need for additional capital There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in development stage operations and have not generated significant revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of new business enterprises, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns. To become profitable and competitive, we will need to raise an additional $16,000,000 to fully implement our plan of operation, and no assurances can be given that we will become profitable or competitive. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Results of Operations From Inception on May 18, 2005 to March 31, 2008 At inception, we sold 45,000,000 shares of common stock to our officers and directors for $500 in cash. More recently, through our initial public offering, we sold 9,393,300 shares of common stock at $0.01 per share and raised $104,370 in gross proceeds. Our initial public offering was closed on March 5, 2007. In December, 2007, we paid a stock dividend of 8 additional shares of common stock for each one share outstanding (9 for 1). On December 18, 2007, James M. Jack resigned as one of our officers and directors and tendered back to us all shares of common stock owned by him (22,500,000 shares) for cancellation. On January 3, 2008, Alfred Nutt, our former president and former director tendered back to us all shares of common stock owned by him (22,500,000 shares) for cancellation. -17- On December 28, 2007, we sold 3,000,000 Units at a per Unit price of $1.25, for aggregate gross proceeds of $3,750,000. Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant. Each warrant is exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance, at an exercise price of $1.25 per warrant. All of these Units were sold to non-US persons pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act. All transactions took place outside the United States. On January 3, 2008, we issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock to Basin Water Resources, Inc. (" BWRI" ) in consideration of BWRI performing certain conditions of its agreement with us dated as of December 28, 2007. The shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933 in that BWRI is an accredited investor with assets in excess of $5,000,000. On January 3, 2008, we sold 200,000 Units to Roytor & Co. at a per Unit price of $1.25, for aggregate gross proceeds of $250,000. Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant. Each warrant is exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance, at an exercise price of $1.25 per warrant. All of these Units were sold to non-US persons pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. All transactions took place outside the United States of America. In addition, on January 3, 2008, we issued warrants to acquire 448,000 restricted shares of our common stock to Canaccord Adams Inc. pursuant to the exemption from registration contained section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933 in that Canaccord Adams Inc. is an accredited investor with assets in excess of $5,000,000. The exercise price of the warrants is $1.25 per share. We have entered in a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to register all of the shares issued to BWRI. On December 28, 2007, we completed the acquisition of the Canal assets. Our loss since inception is $193,900 of which $74,913 is for legal fees, $31,625 for audit fees, $3,379 for water production costs, $5,700 of depreciation, $84,543 for general and administrative costs, $6,232 interest expense offset by water sales of $11,300 and $1,192 of interest income. Subsequent Event Between June 15, 2008 and June 25, 2008, we sold privately 600,000 Units at a per Unit price of $1.25 per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $750,000. The Units were offered by us on a " best efforts" basis. Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and one Warrant. Each Warrant is exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance, at an exercise price of $1.25 per Warrant. The foregoing Units were sold to two non-US persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. One sale was made to Peter L. Jensen, our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, Mr. Jense n being an accredited investor. -18- Liquidity and Capital Resources We initiated our canal operations in January 2008 and generated revenues of $7,921 for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2008, our total assets were $9,276,112 and our total liabilities were $29,713.

The operating cost to produce water from these wells is approximately $20 per acre foot, which is primarily due to the costs of electricity. The school district is charged based on a price per unit based on meter readings. The current price is $315 per acre-foot. The golf course is charged for operating costs based upon its percentage of the total water pumped. In addition to the Canal property, under the West Riverside Purchase Agreements, we acquired the water rights of 350IWC which was formed in 1916. 350IWC has produced water from the Riverside basin for much of the period since inception. There is no assurance that we acquired title to all of the property comprising the foregoing or that the title to the foregoing is unencumbered. Further, there is no assurance that the title to the property we acquired is not materially defective. Contractual Obligations Pursuant to the terms of the West Riverside Purchase Agreements, the West Riverside Sellers will initially receive fifty percent (50%) of all net income relating to the operation of our business, with such percentage to decline (but not below 15%) as additional investments are made in the Canal and related assets; provided however, that the West Riverside Sellers have the right to co-invest with us, and in the event that they elect to do so, their net income participation will not decrease to the extent that they have matched our capital infusions. There is a balance due of $600,000 to Basin Water, Inc. on a water treatment unit. We are the assignee of a Water Supply, Sale and Purchase Agreement ("Water Supply Agreement") with the Jurupa Unified School District ("JUSD"), dated July 2, 2002, relating to a single school site. As set forth in the Water Supply Agreement, we are required to provide up to .81 acre feet of water per day, at a price of $250 per acre foot, subject to further adjustment. The term of the Water Supply Agreement is 20 years and it is only terminable for cause upon default (and failure to cure) by one of the parties. JUSD has a unilateral right to terminate without cause, but will have to pay for capital costs involved in building the water supply facilities based on a schedule included in the Water Supply Agreement. We have an obligation to provide water to the Indian Hills Golf Course ("IHGC"), pursuant to Section 3.3(d) of the Assignment Agreement. As set forth therein, we are required to provide IHGC with up to 505 acre ft. of water per year, at a price equal to our costs of producing and delivering the water. This is an ongoing obligation, but if we fail to deliver at least 90% of the required water for a 60 day period, IHGC will be permitted to use, for its own benefit, the wells and pipelines necessary to obtain water. -20- Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements other than as described above. We have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder = s equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. -21- BUSINESS Our primary business is to own, develop and sell water to wholesale customers under long term contract. We plan to acquire additional water production assets adjacent to our conveyance system in order to increase capacity. We also intend to acquire and develop additional water resource opportunities in California and Arizona. We plan to use the West Riverside Canal or Canal as the backbone of our operations in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Sustainability is an important foundation of our philosophy and goals. Subsequently, we also intend to acquire, utilize and sell reclaimed water. This reclaimed water will be used to provide regional groundwater recharge and will ultimately replace all well water for irrigation supplies. We are not presently, and have no intention of being, a regulated utility selling to individuals. Background We were incorporated in Nevada in May 2005. From inception until December 2007 we intended to engage in business as a business consulting firm. In December 2007, we entered into an agreement with Basin Water Resources, Inc. (" BWRI" ) pursuant to which BWRI assigned to us all of its rights, title and interest in and to certain rights and assets. On May 9, 2007, BWRI and Indian Hills Water Conservation Corporation, a California corporation (" IHWCC" ), West Riverside Canal Company, a California corporation (" West Riverside" ), West Riverside 350 Inch Water Company, a California corporation (" 350IWC," and together with West Riverside, the " Water Companies" ), Henry C. Cox II, an individual (" Cox" ) and John L. West, an individual (" West," and together with IHWCC and Cox, the " West Riverside Sellers" )entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (the " Initial Purchase Agreement" ). Pursuant to the terms of the Initial Purchase Agreement, BWRI had the right to purchase (a) a canal located in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties that is approximately ei ghteen miles in length (the " Canal" ), (b) rights to pump water from the Riverside Basin, and (c) other equipment and tangible and intangible personal property (collectively, the " Assets" ) for total consideration of $1,500,000 and a percentage of net income generated from future operations of the Assets. On December 21, 2007, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with BWRI, effective as of December 28, 2007 (the " BWRI Stock Purchase Agreement" ). Under the terms of the BWRI Stock Purchase Agreement, we acquired the right to purchase the Assets, all of which relate to a business that extracts, pumps, appropriates, stores, supplies, distributes, transports and sells water to customers in and around the Counties of Riverside and San Bernardino in Southern California. These Assets were purchased pursuant to an Assignment and Amendment Agreement entered into on December 21, 2007 and effective as of December 28, 2007 (the " Assignment Agreement" ) by a nd among us, BWRI, IHWCC, West Riverside, 350IWC, Cox and West, pursuant to which we purchased, as the assignee of BWRI, certain assets owned by the West Riverside Sellers. Among other things, the Assignment Agreement provided for both (a) the assignment and delegation by BWRI, and the assumption and acceptance by us, of all of BWRI' s rights and obligations under the Initial Purchase Agreement, and (b) amends the Initial Purchase Agreement. -22- On December 28, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the BWRI Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock to BWRI in exchange for the assignment of BWRI = s rights and obligations under the Assignment Agreement. Prior to the this closing, James M. Jack resigned as one of our officers and directors and tendered back to us all shares of common stock owned by him (22,500,000 shares) for cancellation. On January 3, 2008, Alfred Nutt, our president and sole director, tendered back to us all shares of common stock owned by him (22,500,000 shares) for cancellation. As set forth in the BWRI Stock Purchase Agreement, we have reimbursed BWRI for its due diligence costs and for the $100,000 deposit BWRI paid to the West Riverside Sellers. The total amount of suc h payments was $200,000, including the $100,000 paid for the deposit. We have just initiated the water management business, involving the production, treatment, distribution, transportation and management of water, and will share the net income received from such operations with the West Riverside Sellers. Effective December 28, 2007, we entered into an Agreement for the Purchase and Operation of Water Treatment Unit and Operation of Water Distribution System with Basin Water, Inc. (" Basin Water" ) (the " Unit Purchase Agreement" ). The terms of the Unit Purchase Agreement provide that we will purchase one standard 1,000 gallon per minute nitrate regenerable water treatment system (the " Water Treatment Unit" ) unit from Basin Water for an aggregate purchase price of $900,000. As additional consideration to the West Riverside Sellers, following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the West Riverside Purchase Agreements, the West Riverside Sellers continue to share in the net income resulting from our operations (including any sale of our rights to the Canal to third parties), which are primarily intended to result from water production and distribution. As described in the West Riverside Purchase Agreements, the Seller Parties will initially receive fifty percent (50%) of all net income relating to the operation of business, with such percentage to decline (but not below 15%) as additional investments are made in the Canal and related assets; provided however, that the Seller Parties have the right to co-invest with us, and in the event that they elect to do so, their net income participation will not decrease to the extent that they have matched our capital infusions. Property Acquired In order to supply the development of agricultural property in Riverside County, four canals were constructed to transport water from San Bernardino to Riverside. Three of the four canals are now owned by cities and municipalities and operated to supply their water. The Canal acquired by us is the only canal that is currently privately owned. The Canal is approximately 18 miles in length and consists of a main canal and three separate lateral reaches. The width of the Canal property varies throughout its length, but the width recorded in the original deed is 50 feet. In 2000, two wells and a pipeline distribution network were installed on a portion of the Canal property. This pipeline supplies irrigation water to a golf course owned by certain of the West Riverside Sellers, as well as a school district. -23- Although no assurances can be given, these wells are believed to have a capacity of over 300 million gallons per year, which if true, we believe can be marketed. The operating cost to produce water from these wells is approximately $20 per acre foot, which is primarily due to the costs of electricity. The school district is charged based on a price per unit based on meter readings. The current price is $315 per acre-foot. The golf course is charged for operating costs based upon their percentage of the total water pumped. In addition to the Canal property, under the West Riverside Purchase Agreements, we are acquiring the water rights of 350IWC, which was formed in 1916. 350IWC has produced water from the Riverside basin for much of the period since inception. Overview of the Water Resources Industry; Pricing Constraints Water resources have historically been owned by cities, municipalities and other landowners, such as farmers, ranchers and real estate developers. Due to the constraints on the development of water resources, such as delivery to market, the water resources industry has not flourished in the past. The prices that we will be able to charge for water will depend on current market forces. Currently the Metropolitan Water District supplies 60% of the water supply to Southern California. This pricing provides an avoided cost and is a good indication of prices that we would be able to charge. Regulation Environmental, Health and Safety and Water Quality Regulation Our water operations are subject to extensive United States federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect and treat water. We will also be subject to certain regulations, including the Safe Drinking Water Act, and other federal, state, local regulations governing the provision of water services, particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute. Safe Drinking Water Act The federal Safe Drinking Water Act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency (the " EPA" ) has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants, the treatment systems which may be used for removing contaminants and other requirements. Federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly more stringent, including increased water testing requirements, to reflect public health concerns. -24- For example, in 2001, the EPA decreased permissible arsenic levels in drinking water and required compliance by water systems by January 2006. In 2003, a new EPA rule governing non-radon radionuclides became effective, regulating uranium in drinking water for the first time and requiring initial monitoring under state programs by the end of 2007. We intend to comply with these rules. In order to remove or inactivate microbial organisms, the EPA has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers = exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process. In January 2006, the EPA promulgated the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule. In October 2006, the EPA finalized the Ground Water Rule, applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources. In 2006, the EPA also proposed revisions to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing Lead and Copper Rule. Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, we do not expect current requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. Acquisitions We plan to acquire other water resources in the future. We have paid a $100,000 deposit to California Portland Cement Company to acquire 219 acre feet of water annually to from Meeks & Daley Water Company. Our ownership interest will be evidenced by shares of common stock of Meeks & Daley Water Company. The total purchase price will be $548,250 and is subject to the execution of definitive agreement. Competition In our business, we will compete with other businesses that sell water, including, but not limited to, the Metropolitan Water District (" MWD" ). Water is treated as a commodity in southern California. As such, if we can supply water at a comparable price to MWD, it will be sold in a similar manner as other commodities, such as oil. -25- MANAGEMENT Executive officers and directors Each of our executive officers and directors will serve until their respective successor is elected and qualified.

F-4 - 43 - Empire Water Corporation (Formerly Cascade Coaching Corp.) (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) NOTE 1-BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICY The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Empire Water Corporation (formerly Cascade Coaching Corp,), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in Empires Form 10-KSB. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2007 as reported in the Form 10-KSB, have been omitted. Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from the estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Property acquisition costs Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property consists primarily of wells, pipelines and related equipment. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Depreciation and amortization  The cost of property and equipment is capitalized and depreciated using the 50 year straight-line method over their useful lives. Property consists primarily of wells, pipelines, and related equipment. The estimated useful lives of these assets are fifty years. Maintenance and Repairs  The costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred. Revenue Recognition Revenues are derived from sales of water from wells owned by us, which is delivered through our canal system. The revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of water delivered each month. Accounts Receivable We record accounts receivable net of allowances for uncollectible accounts. Any allowance for uncollectible accounts would be determined based on a review of past due amounts. Income taxes  We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which we do not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. F-5 - 44 - Recently issued accounting pronouncements  We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow. Fair value of financial instruments  The carrying values of receivables, payables, marketable securities and short-term obligations approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. Basic and diluted net loss per share  The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an "as if converted" basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the period ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no potential dilutive securities. NOTE 2-BUSINESS Our primary business is to own, develop and sell water to wholesale customers under long term contract. We plan to acquire additional water production assets adjacent to our conveyance system in order to increase capacity. We also intend to acquire and develop additional water resource opportunities in California and Arizona. We plan to use the West Riverside Canal as the backbone of our operations in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Sustainability is an important foundation of the Company philosophy and goals. Subsequently, we also intend to acquire, utilize and sell reclaimed water. This reclaimed water will be used to provide regional groundwater recharge and will ultimately replace all well water for irrigation supplies. We are not presently and have no intention of being a regulated utility selling to individuals. Background From inception until December 2007 we intended to engage in business as a business consulting firm. In December 2007, we entered into an agreement with Basin Water Resources, Inc. (BWRI) pursuant to which BWRI assigned to us all of its rights, title and interest in and to certain rights and assets. Accordingly, our primary business now is to own, develop and sell water to wholesale customers under long term contract. Pursuant to the agreement with BWRI we acquired the right to purchase certain assets relating to a business that extracts, pumps, appropriates, stores, supplies, distributes, transports and sells water to customers in and around the Counties of Riverside and San Bernardino in Southern California. The business and assets acquired include certain wells and pipelines and related equipment and water rights, as well as a canal that is approximately eighteen (18) miles long, and is located in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties In consideration of the assignment of BWRIs rights and obligations, we issued BWRI 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The shares were issued in January, 2008. However, for accounting purposes, the shares are considered issued as of December 28, 2007, the closing date of the transaction. Prior to the Closing, one of our officers and directors resigned and tendered back to us all shares of common stock owned by him (22,500,000 shares) for cancellation. In January, 2008, our president and sole director tendered back to us all shares of common stock owned by him (22,500,000 shares) for cancellation pursuant to an agreement dated December 28, 2007. For accounting purposes, the cancellation was deemed to have occurred on December 28, 2007. If we are successful in raising additional capital in the minimum amount of at least $10,000,000, we will issue an additional 6,000,000 shares of our common stock to BWRI. As additional consideration, the Sellers continue to share in the net income resulting from our operations (including any sale of our rights to the Canal to third parties), which are primarily intended to result from water production and distribution. The Seller Parties will initially receive fifty percent (50%) of all net income relating to the operation of business, with such percentage to decline (but not below 15%) as additional investments are made in the Canal and related assets; provided however, that the Seller Parties have the right to co-invest with us, and in the event that they elect to do so, their net income participation will not decrease to the extent that they have matched our capital infusions. F-6 - 45 - We also entered into an Agreement for the Purchase and Operation of Water Treatment Unit and Operation of Water Distribution System. The Agreement provides that we will purchase one standard 1,000 gallon per minute nitrate regenerable water treatment system unit for an aggregate purchase price of $900,000, of which $300,000 has been paid as a deposit. In December 2007 and January 2008, we sold privately 3,200,000 Units at a per Unit price of $1.25 per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $4,000,000. The Units were offered by us on a best efforts basis. Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and one Warrant. Each Warrant is exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance, at an exercise price of $1.25 per Warrant. In connection with the unit sale we incurred costs to our selling agent, and others of $596,224. In addition, we issued warrants to acquire 448,000 restricted shares of our common stock to our selling agent. The exercise price of the warrants, which will be exercisable for two years, is $1.25 per share. Note 3-STOCK SPLIT On December 3, 2007 we approved an 8 to 1 stock dividend which is treated as a 9 to 1 forward stock split for accounting purposes, accordingly, all references to number of shared and to per share information in the financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis. Note 4-GOING CONCERN As shown in the accompanying financial statements, Empire incurred initial net losses of $193,900 and has had no significant revenues since inception. In their audit report dated September 24, 2007; our auditors issued a going concern opinion. This means that there was substantial doubt that we could continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtained additional capital. With the $4,000,000 we recently obtained, we believe we can operate for at least one year Note 5-LOANS PAYABLE-RELATED PARTY The loan represents cash advanced to Empire by its founder, who was also the former president. The loan was cancelled when the founder relinquished his shares. Note 6-ACQUISITION On December 28, 2007, the Company acquired all of the operating assets of Indian Hills Water Conservation Corporation and its subsidiaries, West Riverside Canal Company and West Riverside 350 Inch Water Company. In anticipation of this acquisition, the Company changed its name from Cascade Coaching Corp to Empire Water Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the assets was $7,380.000 consisting of $1,500,000 paid in cash to the Indian Hills group and 6,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company to BWRI with a fair value of $5,880,000 for the assignment of a BWRIs rights under a prior agreement to acquire the assets. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired at the date of acquisition are: Wells, pipelines, tunnels and related equipment $ 1,100,000 Land and water rights 6,280.000 If we are successful in raising additional capital in the minimum amount of at least $10,000,000, we will issue an additional 6,000,000 shares of our common stock to BWRI F-7 - 46 - The unaudited pro forma table below reflects the results of operations of the Company for the three and nine months periods ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 as if the acquisition of the business had occurred at the inception of each of the periods presented. Unaudited pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the transaction been consummated as of the date indicated. The unaudited pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in the future.

As set forth in the Water Supply Agreement, we are required to provide up to .81 acre feet of water per day, at a price of $250 per acre foot, subject to further adjustment. The term of the Water Supply Agreement is 20 years and it is only terminable for cause upon default (and failure to cure) by one of the parties. JUSD has a unilateral right to terminate without cause, but will have to pay for capital costs involved in building the water supply facilities based on a schedule included in the Water Supply Agreement. We have an obligation to provide water to the Indian Hills Golf Course (IHGC), pursuant to Section 3.3(d) of the Assignment Agreement. As set forth therein, we are required to provide IHGC with up to 505 acre ft. of water per year, at a price equal to our cost of producing and delivering the water. This is an ongoing obligation, but if we fail to deliver at least 90% of the required water for a 60 day period, IHGC will be permitted to use, for its own benefit, the wells and pipelines necessary to obtain water. Note 8-SUBSEQUENT EVENTS During June 2008, Empire sold privately 600,000 units at a per unit price of $1.25, for aggregate gross proceeds of $750,000. Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and one common stock warrant exercisable at $1.25 for a period of two years from the date of issuance. 200,000 of the units were sold to Peter L. Jensen, Empires principal executive officer and principal accounting officer. F-8 - 47 - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors Cascade Coaching Corp. (A Development Stage Company) Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Cascade Coaching Corp. as of June 30, 2007 and the related statements of expenses, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 and for the period from May 18, 2005 (inception) through June 30, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of Cascade's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cascade Coaching Corp. as of June 30, 2007 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the two years then ended and for the period from May 18, 2005 (inception) through June 30, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Cascade will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Cascade has suffered initial losses, has no operations, and has a working capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

F-13 - 52 - CASCADE COACHING CORP. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cascade Coaching Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on May 18, 2005, for the purpose of providing coaching and consulting services to corporate executives. Cascade Coaching is in the development stage. Since inception, Cascade Coaching has been involved in business planning and capital-raising activities. Use of Estimates. In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenue and expenses in the statement of expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, Cascade Coaching considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition. Cascade Coaching recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Income taxes. Cascade Coaching recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Cascade Coaching provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. Basic and diluted net loss per share. The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an "as if converted" basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the period ended June 30, 2007, there were no potential dilutive securities. Foreign currency. Cascade Coaching is based in Canada, although it is incorporated in Nevada. Since inception, all transactions have been in U.S. dollars, although that will change when operating activities commence. An account, Other Comprehensive Income, will be added to Stockholders Deficit that will represent changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. As of each balance sheet date, any Canadian assets and liabilities will be translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on that date. There are no hedging contracts. Revenues and expenses during each period will be translated at the average exchange rates of those periods. Equity accounts are translated at historical amounts. Translation adjustments are deferred in the equity account, Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), a separate component of Stockholders Equity. F-14 - 53 - Recently issued accounting pronouncements. Cascade Coaching does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flow. NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN As shown in the accompanying financial statements, Cascade Coaching incurred initial net losses of $60,018 and has had no operations since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to Cascade Coachings ability to continue as a going concern. Management is trying to raise additional capital through sales of stock or by additional loans from its current officers. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if Cascade Coaching is unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3  LOANS PAYABLE  RELATED PARTY The loan represents cash advanced to Cascade by its founder, who is also the current president. The loan is due upon demand, with no interest or collateral. Imputed interest in the amount of $4,400 for the year ended June 30, 2007 is included in paid-in capital. NOTE 4  COMMON STOCK During fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, Cascade Coaching sold 1,043,700 common shares in a public offering for $104,370. NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES Cascade Coaching uses the liability method, where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. During fiscal years 2007 and 2006, Cascade Coaching incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $60,018 at June 30, 2007, and will expire beginning in the year 2025. At June 30, 2007, deferred tax assets consisted of the following: Deferred tax assets Net operating losses $ 20,046 Less: valuation allowance ( 20,046 ) Net deferred tax asset $ - F-15 - 54 - PART II. INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS ITEM 13. OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION.

UNDERTAKINGS. A. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to: (a) include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (b) reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the " Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement; and (c) include any additional or changed material information with respect to the plan of distribution. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered herein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) For the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser: Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A ( '' 230.430A of this chapter), shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of t he registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made - 58 - in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. B. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction th e question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. C. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post- effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. - 59 - SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing of this Form S-1 Registration Statement and has duly caused this amended Form S-1 Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in San Diego, California on this 27 th day of June, 2008.
