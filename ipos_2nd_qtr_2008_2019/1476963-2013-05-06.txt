Heat Biologics Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel allogeneic, off-the-shelf cellular therapeutic vaccines to combat a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. Our proprietary ImPACT I mmune P an A ntigen C ytotoxic T herapy is being designed to deliver live, genetically-modified, irradiated human cells which are reprogrammed to pump out a broad spectrum of cancer associated antigens together with a potent immune adjuvant called gp96 to educate and activate a cancer patients immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. We intend for our ImPACT cells to secrete an antigen-adjuvant complex that generates anti-cancer immune responses in patients by mobilizing and activating cytotoxic killer T cells that target multiple cancer antigens, thus harnessing a patients own immune system to fight cancer. Unlike autologous or personalized therapeutic vaccine approaches which require extraction and processing of cancer or blood from each individual patient, our ImPACT therapeutic vaccine uses a common master cell line to mass-produce a single vaccine product applicable to all patients for each particular cancer type. We believe our off-the-shelf, allogenic immunotherapy offers logistical, manufacturing and cost of goods benefits compared to autologous patient-specific approaches. We have filed an IND to initiate a Phase II clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC) patients with our therapeutic vaccine candidate HS-110, which is derived from a genetically-modified human lung cancer cell line. We believe that the results of our recently completed Phase I clinical trial in NSCLC demonstrated that our HS-110 is designed to generate anti-cancer immune responses. Eighteen patients were vaccinated, and 15 of the 18 vaccinated patients completed the first course of three planned courses of therapy. Based on our evaluation, 11 of 15 patients responded to our therapy with a median survival of 16.5 months for immune responders, versus a median survival of 4.5 months for immune non-responders and the historical control group. The one-year overall survival rate of patients in our study was 44%, comparing quite favorably with the 5% rate for the historical control group. One of our late-stage lung cancer patients is surviving over four years since starting our therapy and another patient is surviving over three years since starting our therapy. These findings were consistent with multiple pre-clinical published studies on ImPACT therapy. We have also developed ImPACT therapeutic vaccines for bladder cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. We plan to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial for bladder cancer in mid-2013 with HS-410, a genetically-modified bladder cancer cell line. We also plan to initiate a second grant-funded, investigator-sponsored Phase I clinical trial of our ImPACT therapy against NSCLC in the second quarter of 2013. To date, in excess of $14,000,000 of funding has been awarded to the primary inventor of the technology that we license by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and through other research and clinical grants, which has been used to further develop our ImPACT technology platform. 1 The table below summarizes our current product candidates and their stages of development: Product Candidate Indication Phase of Development Upcoming Milestone(s) HS-110 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Completed Phase I. Phase II IND currently on file. 2013 - Initiate Phase II HS-410 Bladder Cancer Adjuvant Completing cGMP Drug Manufacturing 2013 - Initiate Phase I/II HS-110 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Combination Therapy Completed cGMP Drug Manufacturing 2013 - Initiate Phase I HS-310 Ovarian Cancer Initiating cGMP Manufacturing 2014 - Phase I/II trials HS-510 Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Cell line development underway 2014 - Phase I/II trials HS-HIV HIV NIH-sponsored Primate Studies Complete Additional studies underway The NIH is also currently fully funding the primary inventors study of our HS-HIV product candidate in non-human primates with a therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine for the treatment and prevention of HIV utilizing our ImPACT approach. ImPACT TherapyNovel Pan-Antigen Immune Activation Our ImPACT therapy is a novel technology platform designed to educate and stimulate the immune system to combat specific disease targets, such as cancer cells. ImPACT utilizes live, human-derived, genetically-modified attenuated cells that generate an array of cellular antigens complexed to a secreted immunostimulatory protein called gp96, a heat shock protein. The secreted antigen and adjuvant complex are designed to generate a potent immune response to cancer cells by mobilizing and activating a patients own killer T cells to recognize and attack a broad array of different tumor antigens with the goal of eliminating cancer cells. In contrast to other vaccine technologies that target only single cancer antigens, ImPACTs pan-antigen approach is designed to enable the patient to induce and maintain an immune response against a broad array of tumor-specific proteins, by potentially providing a more robust immune response and limiting cancer cells ability to evade the immune system. We believe that our clinical and pre-clinical results suggest that ImPACT is designed to generate anti-tumor immune responses capable of targeting and destroying tumors and maintaining remission. We believe our novel, off-the-shelf, live attenuated cell therapy can potentially be used to not only combat a wide range of cancers, but also to treat various infectious diseases, such as hepatitis C, malaria and HIV. NIH-funded non-human primate studies of ImPACT for HIV, which we believe are encouraging, have been completed. Recent Developments In March 2013, we closed the first tranche of our Series B Preferred Stock private placement offering in which we sold an aggregate of 1,891,419 shares of our Series B-1 Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $5,050,090. The investors in the offering committed to purchase and we agreed to sell an additional 433,122 shares of our Series B-2 Preferred Stock at a second tranche closing to be held after fulfillment of certain conditions, including receipt of additional grant funding. In addition, at the second tranche closing, we have agreed to issue to each investor a warrant exercisable for two shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock for each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock purchased by them at the second tranche closing. All shares of the Series B Preferred Stock automatically convert into shares of our common stock upon the consummation of a firm commitment underwritten public offering resulting in aggregate net cash proceeds to us of at least $15,000,000. 2 Strengths and Competitive Advantages We believe that the following are key investment attributes of our company: · We believe our ImPACT technology combines broad antigen targeting complexed with a potent immune adjuvant. We believe ImPACT has already been shown to activate the immune system against a wide variety of antigens by eliciting a significant cytotoxic T cell immune response as measured by extensive pre-clinical and clinical immunological testing. The activated immune response generated by our ImPACT Therapy may be useful in treating wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. · We have filed an IND to initiate a Phase II clinical trial in NSCLC patients with our therapeutic vaccine candidate HS-110, which is derived from a genetically-modified human lung cancer cell line. We expect to initiate Phase I/II clinical trials for bladder cancer with our second product candidate, HS-410, in mid-2013. · The National Institute of Health (NIH) and other organizations have provided significant funding to the primary inventor of the technology that we license for both our pre-clinical and clinical studies. · Our proprietary technology platform, ImPACT , is being applied to develop multiple therapeutic vaccines against a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. We believe we have many opportunities to generate positive results and to gain FDA approval, which lowers our dependence on any one drug in order to generate returns. · We believe our therapeutic vaccines are easier and less expensive to manufacture than autologous vaccines because our therapeutic vaccines do not require the harvesting of blood and/or cancer cells from each patient in order to manufacture a course of treatment. We believe this is highly advantageous because it can bring the logistics, manufacturing, cost and distribution of our therapeutic vaccines within the purview of traditional biopharmaceutical product channels and dramatically expand our pool of corporate partners. · We believe our technology can readily be adapted to incorporate new cancer types. Because of this, and the fact that our vaccine approach is allogeneic (off-the-shelf), we are able to rapidly develop new vaccines for different types of cancers and other diseases. · Our therapy does not require an adjuvant. Some vaccines require the addition of another drug, called an adjuvant, to enhance their effectiveness. Adjuvants typically cause irritation at the injection site. As HS-110 is itself an adjuvant, we do not have to use additional adjuvants to generate and maintain an activated immune response. · We believe our business model is capital efficient as we continue to leverage academic and institutional resources to develop new products and to move these products into and through clinical trials. Our Strategy Our strategy is to utilize our novel ImPACT technology platform to produce a pipeline of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of various cancers and infectious diseases and rapidly and efficiently progress these products through clinical trials towards regulatory approval. Our near term strategy includes attempting to achieve the following: · Develop and obtain regulatory approval for our ImPACT-based products; · Maximize commercial opportunity for our ImPACT technology ; · Further expand our broad patent portfolio; · Manage our business with efficiency and discipline; and · Obtain additional grant funding to more fully develop our ImPACT technology platform and its application to a variety of human diseases. 3 Corporate Information We were incorporated on June 10, 2008 under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name Heat Biologics, Inc.

If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements made throughout this prospectus as a result of different factors, including the risks we face described below. Risks Relating to our Company We have had limited operations to date. We are a start-up entity and have had limited operations to date. As a start-up entity, we are subject to many of the risks common to such enterprises, including our ability to implement our business plan, market acceptance of our proposed business and products, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and uncertainty of our ability to generate revenues. There is no assurance that our activities will be successful or will result in any revenues or profit, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the stage of our development. Even if we generate revenue, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate our business strategy and plans, as described herein, or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations may force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans. We have insufficient results for investors to use to identify historical trends or even to make quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results. You should consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early stage company. Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving. We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks. We have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our ability to commercialize our products . We are a development-stage company and our success is dependent upon our ability to commercialize our products and we have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates. The successful commercialization of any product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including: · continuing to undertake pre-clinical development and clinical trials; · participating in regulatory approval processes; · formulating and manufacturing products; and · conducting sales and marketing activities. Our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing the Company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology and undertaking pre-clinical and clinical trials of our product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to commercialize our product candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities. We currently have no product revenues and may not generate revenue at any time in the near future, if at all. We currently have no products for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale. We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA (FDA) and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping. Until, and unless, we receive approval from the, and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we cannot sell our vaccines and will not have product revenues. For the foreseeable future, we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from cash on hand, and grants, and potentially, future offerings. At the conclusion of this offering, we believe we have cash on hand to fund our Phase II clinical trial for 9 NSCLC, and our Phase I clinical trial for bladder cancer. However, changes may occur that would consume our available capital before that time, including changes in and progress of our development activities, acquisitions of additional candidates and changes in regulation. Moreover, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may not start or be completed as we forecast and may not achieve the desired results. We may continue to generate operating losses and experience negative cash flows and it is uncertain whether we will achieve profitability. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we incurred a net loss of ($2,471,147) and ($2,113,142), respectively. We have also incurred an accumulated deficit since inception of ($5,935,282). We may continue to incur operating losses until such time, if ever, as we are able to achieve sufficient levels of revenue from operations. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend on the market acceptance of our product offerings and our capacity to develop, introduce and sell our products to our targeted markets. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant sales or achieve profitability. Accordingly, the extent of future losses and the time required to achieve profitability, if ever, cannot be predicted at this point. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more product candidates, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we: · continue to undertake pre-clinical development and clinical trials for product candidates; · seek regulatory approvals for product candidates; · implement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and · hire additional personnel. We also expect to experience negative cash flows for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability would likely negatively impact the value of our securities and could prevent us from continuing as a going concern. If we default on our secured loans with Square 1 Bank, we would be forced to suspend all operations. We have entered into loans with Square 1 Bank that are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. Our loan agreement with Square 1 Bank sets forth various affirmative and negative covenants that we must comply with, including covenants regarding financial reporting, limits on our cash burn, incurrence of indebtedness and liens and merger and acquisitions. If we fail to comply with these covenants or if we fail to make timely monthly payments under the secured loans when due, Square 1 Bank could declare our loans in default. Additionally, if we do not commercialize a product by the maturity date of the loan, we may be unable to repay the loans to Square 1 Bank. If we default on the loans, Square 1 Bank has the right to seize the collateral secured by the loans, which would result in our licenses reverting back to our licensor and would force us to suspend all operations. In order to comply with the covenants of the loans and to make timely payments to Square 1 Bank under the loans, we may need to raise additional capital, which might not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Risks Relating to our Business If we do not obtain the necessary U.S. or worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidate, we will not be able to sell our product candidates . We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates or any product candidates we acquire or develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. and approvals from the FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidate in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidates, we must submit to the FDA a New Biologics License Application, or BLA, demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant 10 research and animal tests, which are referred to as pre-clinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDAs regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our clinical trials will demonstrate achievement of our endpoints or if the final results of our clinical trial will meet the FDAs requirements to approve product commercialization and marketing. We also cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs or therapeutics that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process. The approval process may be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may: · delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidate; · impose costly procedures on us; and · diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise believe that we hold. Even if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or may not approve our manufacturing processes or facilities. We may never obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire another product candidate. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. As a condition to granting marketing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. The results generated in these Phase IV trials could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA) gave the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The FDAs exercise of its authority under the FDAAA has in some cases resulted, and in the future could result, in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. In foreign jurisdictions, we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any vaccines. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidate for sale outside the United States. There is uncertainty as to market acceptance of our technology and products. We have conducted our own research into the markets for our products; however because we will be a new entrant into the market we cannot guarantee market acceptance of our products and have somewhat limited information on which to estimate our anticipated level of sales. Our products will require patients and doctors to adopt our technology. Our industry is susceptible to rapid technological developments and there can be no assurance that we will be able to match any new technological advances. If we are unable to match the technological changes in the needs of our customers the demand for our products will be reduced. Our product candidates are in early stages of clinical trials . Because our product candidates are in early stages of development they will require extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. Only one product candidate is currently ready for Phase II clinical trials. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit a BLA for regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or whether any such BLA will be accepted. 11 Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement . As part of the regulatory process, we must conduct clinical trials for each product candidate to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The number and design of the clinical trials that will be required varies depending upon product candidate, the condition being evaluated the trial results and regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the clinical trials. Human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of our product candidate will take at least several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including: · unforeseen safety issues; · determination of dosing issues; · the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate; · lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; · slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; · the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; · inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; · third party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner; · insufficient or inadequate supply or quality of drug product candidates or other necessary materials to conduct our trials; · potential additional safety monitoring, or other conditions required by FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials, or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; · problems engaging IRBs to oversee trials or in obtaining and maintaining IRB approval of studies; · regulators may hold or suspend our clinical trials while collecting supplemental information on, or clarification of, our clinical trials or other clinical trials, including trials conducted in other countries or trials conducted by other companies; and · inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols. In addition, we or the FDA may suspend or terminate our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our Investigational New Drug, or IND, submissions or the conduct of these trials. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for future clinical trials. The results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims . Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the 12 filing of our BDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, our clinical trials involve a small patient population. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results. Physicians and patients may not accept and use our product candidates . Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, the products may not gain broad market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients, and the medical community. Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: · perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our therapeutics; · cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products; · convenience and ease of administration; · potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; · availability of reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payers; and · effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any. Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these therapeutics to find market acceptance would substantially harm our business and would adversely affect our revenue. Our development program depends upon third-party researchers who are outside our control . We are dependent upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA applications, if any, and our introduction of new product candidates, if any, will be delayed if obtained at all. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed. We have little control over the direction of the NIH grant funds that have been received by the primary inventor of the technology we license and since payment is made to the inventor as opposed to us we do not recognize any revenue from such grant funds nor do they fund any expenses that we incur. To date, in excess of $14,000,000 of funding has been awarded by the NIH to the primary inventor of the technology we license. Although earmarked for further development of the technology that we license, any funds awarded to the primary inventor are used in his discretion and we have little control over his use of the funds. We will rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidate . We have no experience in the formulation or manufacturing of therapeutics and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates. The supplies for our Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are currently manufactured by our cGMP contractors under current good manufacturing practices and we have entered into an agreement with one manufacturer for the manufacture and supply of the material for our Phase III clinical trials and commercialization efforts. If any of our current product candidates or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future receive FDA approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our vaccines. Our anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks: · We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any contractor. This approval would require new 13 testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any. · Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our vaccines in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical needs and commercial needs, if any. · Our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products. · Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers ’ compliance with these regulations and standards. · If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation. Each of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues. We have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products and have no internal capability to do so . We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. We do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our proposed products. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities, the collaborators strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborators ability to successfully market and sell any such products. We intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if able to do so, that our collaborators will have effective sales forces. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with technical expertise. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. In addition, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our products in the United States or overseas. We may not be successful in establishing and maintaining strategic partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products. We may seek to enter into strategic partnerships in the future, including alliances with other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, to enhance and accelerate the development and commercialization of our products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any future product candidates and programs because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us and we may not be able to maintain such strategic partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product are disappointing. If we ultimately determine that entering into strategic partnerships is in our best interest but either fail to enter into, are delayed in entering into or fail to maintain such strategic partnerships: · the development of certain of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed; 14 · our cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly and we may need to seek additional financing; · we may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted; · we will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates; · the competitiveness of any product candidate that is commercialized could be reduced; To the extent we elect to enter into licensing or collaboration agreements to partner our product candidates, our dependence on such relationships may adversely affect our business. Our commercialization strategy for certain of our product candidates may depend on our ability to enter into agreements with collaborators to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of these product candidates. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. Even if we are successful in entering into one or more collaboration agreements, collaborations may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we have less control over certain aspects of our collaborative programs than we do over our proprietary development and commercialization programs. We may determine that continuing a collaboration under the terms provided is not in our best interest, and we may terminate the collaboration. Our collaborators could delay or terminate their agreements, and our products subject to collaborative arrangements may never be successfully commercialized. Further, our future collaborators may develop alternative products or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, and the priorities or focus of our collaborators may shift such that our programs receive less attention or resources than we would like, or they may be terminated altogether. Any such actions by our collaborators may adversely affect our business prospects and ability to earn revenues. In addition, we could have disputes with our future collaborators, such as the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Any such disagreements could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of any potential products or could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration, which may not be resolved in our favor. If we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer . The market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If any of our product candidates receives FDA approval, it will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer. We will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have oncology compounds already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in: · developing drugs and therapies; · undertaking pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials; · obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs and therapies; · formulating and manufacturing drugs and therapies; and 15 · launching, marketing and selling drugs and therapies. We have limited protection of our intellectual property. We intend to rely on a combination of common law copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and measures to protect our proprietary information. We have obtained exclusive rights to license the technology for which patent protection has been obtained; however such protection does not prevent unauthorized use of such technology. Trademark and copyright protections may be limited, and enforcement could be too costly to be effective. It may also be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of, or otherwise obtain and use, our proprietary information without authorization, including, but not limited to, product design, software, customer and prospective customer lists, trade secrets, copyrights, patents and other proprietary rights and materials. Other parties can use and register confusingly similar business, product and service names, as well as domain names, which could divert customers, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. Competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or future patents we may obtain. In addition, our licensed patents may not provide us a meaningful competitive advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our licensed intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. The technology we license may be found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Third parties may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to their patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights in technology that is important to us. The asserted claims and/or litigation could include claims against us, our licensors or our suppliers alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of the claims, they could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. We cannot assure you that licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, because of the potential for significant damage awards, which are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims resulting in large settlements. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: · obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; · abandon an infringing drug or therapy candidate; · redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; · stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; · pay damages; or · defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources. 16 We rely on licenses to use various technologies that are material to our business and if the agreements were to be terminated, it would halt our ability to market our products and technology, as well as have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We have licensing agreements with certain universities granting us the right to use certain critical intellectual property. The terms of the licensing agreements continues until the end of the life of the last patent to expire. If we breach the terms of these licensing agreements, including any failure to make minimum royalty payments required thereunder or failure to reach certain developmental milestones such as use best effort to introduce a licensed product in certain territories by 2020, the licensor has the right to terminate the license. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain these licenses on acceptable terms, it would halt our ability to market our products and technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet the minimum royalties or developmental milestones required under our license agreements, For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and thereafter our minimum royalty obligations under our licensing agreements are $20,000, $20,000, $20,000, $20,000, $270,000 and $180,000, respectively. No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue or raise additional financing to make these minimum royalty payments. The license agreements also provide for certain developmental milestones. No assurance can be given that we will meet all of the required developmental milestones. Any failure to make the payments or reach the milestones required by the license agreements would permit the licensor to terminate the license. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain these licenses, it would halt our ability to market our products and technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our therapies sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement . Our ability to commercialize our vaccines, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from: · government and health administration authorities; · private health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and · other healthcare payers. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we would receive for any products in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs and therapeutics. We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to such payers satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Even if one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, insurance coverage may not be available, and reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover such vaccines. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for one of our products, once approved, market acceptance of such product could be reduced. Legislative and regulatory changes affecting the health care industry could adversely affect our business Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. U.S. and foreign governments, for example, continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In some foreign markets, the government controls the pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals. In the U.S., we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental controls. In addition, recent changes in the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing. It is uncertain whether or when any legislative proposals will be 17 adopted or what actions federal, state, or private payers for health care treatment and services may take in response to any health care reform proposal or legislation. We cannot predict the effect health care reforms may have on our business and we can offer no assurances that any of these reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our business. These actual and potential changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. In addition, uncertainly remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the U.S. health care system. We may not successfully effect our intended expansion . Our success will depend upon the expansion of our operations and the effective management of our growth, which will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative, operational and financial resources. To manage this growth, we must expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business would be harmed. We may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of biological and hazardous materials and chemicals . Our research and development activities may involve the controlled use of biological and hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on key executive officers and scientific and medical advisors, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace . We are highly dependent on our principal scientific, regulatory and medical advisors and our chief executive officer. We do not have key person life insurance policies for any of our officers or advisors. The loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of our key personnel could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed . We will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in pre-clinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, sales and marketing and accounting and financing. In particular, over the next 12 months, we expect to hire up to 10 new employees. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success. Certain of our officers may have a conflict of interest. Some of our officers are currently working for the Company on a part-time basis. Several of the part-time employees also work at other jobs and have discretion to decide what time they devote to our activities, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to responsibilities at other jobs. We expect that some of these officers may join the Company on a full-time basis at the completion of this offering, but there can be no assurance given that any or all of our officers will be so employed. 18 We may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits . The testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. Clinical trial liability claims may be filed against us for damages suffered by clinical trial subjects or their families. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products which could impact our ability to continue as a going concern. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in: · decreased demand for any approved drug candidates; · impairment of our business reputation; · withdrawal of clinical trial participants; · costs of related litigation; · distraction of management ’ s attention; · substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; · loss of revenues; and · the inability to successfully commercialize any approved drug candidates. International expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Our business strategy incorporates international expansion, including establishing and maintaining clinician marketing and education capabilities outside of the United States and expanding our relationships with distributors and manufacturers. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including: · multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; · failure by us or our distributors to obtain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our tests in various countries, including failure to achieve CE Marking, a conformity mark which is required to market in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the European Economic Area and which is broadly accepted in other international markets; · difficulties in managing foreign operations; · complexities associated with managing multiple payor-reimbursement regimes or self-pay systems; · logistics and regulations associated with shipping tissue samples, including infrastructure conditions and transportation delays; · limits on our ability to penetrate international markets if our diagnostic tests cannot be processed by an appropriately qualified local laboratory; · financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; · reduced protection for intellectual property rights; · natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and · failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors activities. Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 19 We may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense. As part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of businesses and assets. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. We have no experience with acquiring other companies and limited experience with forming strategic alliances and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture. To finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Declining general economic or business conditions may have a negative impact on our business. Continuing concerns over United States health care reform legislation and energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and government stimulus programs in the United States and other countries have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with low business and consumer confidence and high unemployment, precipitated an economic slowdown and recession. If the economic climate does not improve or continues to deteriorate, our business, including our access to patient samples and the addressable market for diagnostic tests that we may successfully develop, as well as the financial condition of our suppliers and our third-party payors, could be adversely affected, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. government may have march-in rights to certain of our probe related intellectual property. Because federal grant monies were used in support of the research and development activities that resulted in certain of our issued U.S. patents, the federal government retains what are referred to as march-in rights to these patents. In particular, the National Institutes of Health, which administered grant monies to the primary inventor of the technology we license, technically retain the right to require us, under certain specific circumstances, to grant the U.S. government either a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license to the patented invention in any field of use, upon terms that are reasonable for a particular situation. Circumstances that trigger march-in rights include, for example, failure to take, within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in a field of use, failure to satisfy the health and safety needs of the public and failure to meet requirements of public use specified by federal regulations. The National Institutes of Health can elect to exercise these march-in rights on their own initiative or at the request of a third-party. 20 Risks Related to this Offering Upon the sale of the shares offered in this prospectus, our Preferred Stock will convert into shares of common stock . Holders of our Preferred Stock have several rights that our common shareholders do not have such as preference on payment of dividends and liquidation distributions, the right to elect a certain number of directors, the right to adjustment in the event that securities are issued at a price per share less than that paid by the holders of the Preferred Stock. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that our Preferred Stock automatically converts to common stock upon the earlier of (i) a closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, resulting in at least $15,000,000 of net proceeds to us; (ii) with respect to the Series 1 Preferred Stock, written consent or agreement two thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock; (iii) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, (which must include the lead investor) written consent or agreement two thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (iv) with respect to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, written consent or agreement two thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock; and (v) with respect to the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, written consent or agreement of two thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock. Upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock the holders of common stock will experience additional dilution. Certain of our officers and directors have sufficient voting power to make corporate governance decisions that could have a significant effect on us and the other stockholders. Our officers and directors together will control approximately % of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis after consummation of this offering assuming the issuance of all shares of common stock offered in this offering. Mr. Wolf alone through his direct and indirect holdings will control approximately % of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis after consummation of this offering assuming the issuance of all shares of common stock offered in this offering. As a result, Mr. Wolf, alone will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in our control and might affect the market price of our common stock, even when a change in control may be in the best interest of all stockholders. Furthermore, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider. The possible issuance of common stock subject to options and warrants may dilute the interest of stockholders. In 2009, we adopted a 2009 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan under which we may grant awards to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, of which, 1,435,564 options were outstanding as of May 1, 2013. In addition, as of May 1, 2013, we have 122,262 shares issuable upon exercise of warrants granted to third parties in connection with prior private placements of our equity securities and debt. To the extent that outstanding stock options and warrants are exercised, or additional securities are issued, dilution to the interests of our stockholders may occur. Moreover, the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected since the holders of the outstanding options can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in such outstanding options. We have additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of our common stock and 8,212,500 shares of Preferred Stock. The common stock and preferred stock, as well as the awards available for issuance under the 2009 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, can be issued by our board of directors, without stockholder approval. Any future issuances of such stock would further dilute the percentage ownership of us held by holders of Preferred Stock and common stock. The classes of Preferred Stock that are 21 currently outstanding, which will convert to common stock upon consummation of this offering, rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights and could adversely affect the voting power and the rights of our holders of common stock. In addition, the issuance of Preferred Stock may be used as an anti-takeover device without further action on the part of our stockholders, and may adversely affect the holders of the common stock. We have never paid dividends and have no plans to pay dividends in the future. Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our shares of our preferred or common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of our business. Therefore, any return investors in our preferred or common stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of common stock. See Dividend Policy. Shareholders purchasing shares in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution, causing their investment to immediately be worth less than their purchase price. If you purchase common stock in this offering, you will experience an immediate and substantial dilution in the projected book value of the common stock from the price you pay in this offering. After consummation of this offering and assuming the consummation of this offering and conversion of all of the outstanding Preferred Stock exclusive of the over-allotment option, you will have an immediate dilution of $ per common share and an immediate increase in net tangible book value to our present shareholders from $ to $ per share will occur. We are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act enacted in April 2012, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, not being required to comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, not being required to comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of : (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Further, as a result of these scaled regulatory requirements, our disclosure may be more limited than that of other public companies and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of such companies. Under Section 107(b) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 22 As a result of our becoming a public company, we will become subject to additional reporting and corporate governance requirements that will require additional management time, resources and expense. In connection with this filing, we will become obligated to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We will also become subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, all of which will impose significant compliance and reporting obligations upon us and require us to incur additional expense in order to fulfill such obligations. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We have historically operated as a private company and the number and qualifications of our finance and accounting staff have not been consistent with those of a public company. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls with respect to our financial statement closing process of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Our management discovered certain conditions that we deemed to be material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls, as follows: · A lack of accounting and finance resources as well as effective oversight by those in charge of governance resulted in insufficient controls over timely financial statement preparation and review as well as the preparation and review around accounting for certain complex transactions. · The design of monitoring controls used to assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls is inadequate. We also do not have an adequate internal process to report deficiencies in internal control to management on a timely basis. We have begun to take actions that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified. In response to the identification of our material weaknesses, we (i) intend to hire additional finance and accounting personnel; (ii) are in the process of establishing a review process for key aspects of our financial reporting process, including the accounting for complex transactions; and (iii) will seek to establish better operating controls and involve our board of directors in our internal controls process, which will involve establishing formal procedures to communicate deficiencies in internal controls on a timely basis, and encourage our board of directors to more actively participate in guiding management as it relates to internal controls matters. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. Regardless, following the completion of this offering we will be required to expend time and resources to further improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our finance and accounting staff. Future sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders could cause our stock price to decline. The Company will have a significant number of restricted shares that will become eligible for sale shortly after this registration statement is declared effective. We currently have 4,282,281 shares of our common stock outstanding, all of which are restricted securities. The shares being registered herein shares will be eligible for sale immediately upon the effectiveness of this registration statement. All of the remaining shares will be eligible for resale under Rule 144 within ninety days of us being a reporting company under Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act; however shares will be held by affiliates and will be subject to the limitations described under Shares Eligible For Future Sale. It is conceivable that following the holding period, many shareholders may wish to sell some or all of their shares. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market at the same time, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly due to an imbalance in the supply 23 and demand of our common stock. Even if they do not actually sell the stock, the perception in the public market that our shareholders might sell significant shares of our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities, and may cause you to lose part or all of your investment in our shares of common stock. Our common stock may be thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares. Prior to this offering, you could not buy or sell our common stock publicly. We cannot predict the extent to which investors interests will lead to an active trading market for our common stock or whether the market price of our common stock will be volatile following this offering. If an active trading market does not develop, investors may have difficulty selling any of our common stock that they buy. There may be limited market activity in our stock and we are likely to be too small to attract the interest of many brokerage firms and analysts. We cannot give you any assurance that a public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses, announcements of new products or services by us, significant sales of our common stock, including short sales, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions. The offering price of the shares may not be indicative of the value of our assets or the price at which shares can be resold. The offering price of the common stock may not be an indication of our actual value. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our securities. The offering price of $ per share was determined based upon negotiations between the underwriters and us. Factors considered in determining such price in addition to prevailing market conditions include an assessment of our future prospects, an increase in value of our stock due to becoming a public company and prior valuations of certain minority interests prepared for us. Such price does not have any relationship to any established criteria of value, such as book value or earnings per share. Such price is not indicative of the current market value of our assets. No assurance can be given that the shares can be resold at the public offering price. Our need for future financing may result in the issuance of additional securities which will cause investors to experience dilution . Our cash requirements may vary from those now planned depending upon numerous factors, including the result of future research and development activities. We believe that the proceeds derived from the sale of the shares in this offering will provide us with sufficient working capital to fund our Phase II clinical trial for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and our Phase I clinical trial for bladder cancer. Thereafter, we expect to require additional funds in the future to conduct additional clinical trials even if the maximum amount is raised in this offering. There are no other commitments by any person for future financing other than: (i) a loan from Square 1 Bank for an amount up to $3,000,000; however in order to continue to borrow under the loan there are several conditions which must be met and there can be no assurance that we will meet such conditions or be able to borrow the entire $3,000,000 and (ii) a commitment from investors to purchase 433,122 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock for additional gross proceeds to us of $2,165,610; however in order to receive such proceeds there are various closing conditions which must first be met. There can be no assurance given that we will meet these closing conditions. Through May 1, 2013, we have outstanding $725,000 under our loan from Square 1 Bank. Our securities may be offered to other investors at a price lower than the price per share offered to the investors in the offering, or upon terms which may be deemed more favorable than offered hereunder. In addition, the issuance of securities in this offering as well as any future financing using our securities may dilute an investor's equity ownership. Moreover, we may issue derivative securities, including options and/or warrants, from time to time, to procure qualified personnel or for other business reasons. The issuance of any such derivative securities, which is at the discretion of our board of directors, may further dilute the equity ownership of our stockholders, including the investors in this offering. No assurance can be given as to our ability to procure additional financing, if required, and on terms deemed favorable to us. To the 24 extent additional capital is required and cannot be raised successfully, we may then have to limit our then current operations and/or may have to curtail certain, if not all, of our business objectives and plans. We have adopted certain measures that may have anti-takeover effects which may make an acquisition of our Company by another company more difficult. We have adopted, and may in the future adopt, certain measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our Company that a holder of our common stock might not consider in its best interest. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which may have anti-takeover effects. These include: (a) requiring that certain shareholder groups elect a certain number of directors until we consummate a firm commitment underwritten public offering with net proceeds of at least $15,000,000; (b) requiring that for so long as any shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding and until we consummate a firm commitment underwritten public offering with net proceeds to us of at least $15,000,000 a majority of each of the Series B Preferred shareholders, Series A Preferred shareholders, the Series 1 Preferred shareholders and the common shareholders approve certain actions including (i) amendments to our bylaws or certificate of incorporation; (ii) creation of additional classes of stock or increases in the authorized shares of an existing class of stock unless they rank junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets on liquidation and the payment of dividends, reclassification stock or redemption of stock; (iii) action to reclassify, alter or amend existing securities that are junior to or pari passu with the Series A Preferred if such action would render such security senior to or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of the distribution of assets upon liquidation or payment of a dividend other than with respect to a firm commitment underwritten public offering with net proceeds to us of at least $15,000,000; (iv) purchase or redeem or otherwise declare or pay a dividend, action to liquidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; (c) requiring that for so long as a majority of the originally issued shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding and until we receive $20,000,000 through financing, grant or a licensing or joint venture agreement or until we consummate of a firm commitment underwritten public offering with net proceeds to us of at least $15,000,000 a majority of Series B Preferred shareholders approve certain actions including (i) operation of any business other than our business as currently carried out; (ii) making of a loan to any entity or subsidiary other than an 80% owned subsidiary, (iii) disposition or acquisition of an interest in a business; (iv) entering into a joint venture or making an investment in excess of $5,000,000; (v) making or committing to make an expenditure of $5,000,000 or more; (vi) making a loan of in excess of $5,000; (vii) issuing debt in excess of $5,000,000 other than under existing agreements; and (viii) an annual budget, and (d) providing that directors may be removed only for "cause." These measures and those described above may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the Company that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest. Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we receive in this offering, and may not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in this offering in full, we estimate that net proceeds of the sale of the common stock that we are offering will be approximately $ million. Our management will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds from this offering, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. Although we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for research, development and commercialization of our products and payment of outstanding indebtedness, because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we cannot specify with certainty the particular use of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering, and we cannot assure you that we will use the proceeds in a manner that will increase the value of your investment or of which you would approve. Moreover, you will not have the opportunity to influence our decision on how to use the proceeds from this offering. We may use the proceeds for corporate purposes that do not immediately enhance our prospects for the future or increase the value of your investment.

We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 26 USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $ million from the sale of shares of common stock offered in this offering, or approximately $ million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus) and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus) would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, by approximately $ , assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering. An increase (decrease) of in the number of shares we are offering would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, by approximately $ million, assuming the initial public offering price per share stays the same. An increase of in the number of shares we are offering, together with a $1.00 increase in the assumed initial public offering price per share, would increase the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, by approximately $ million. A decrease of in the number of shares we are offering, together with a $1.00 decrease in the assumed initial public offering price per share, would decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, by approximately $ million. We do not expect that a change in the offering price per share or the number of shares by these amounts would have a material effect on our intended uses of the net proceeds from this offering, although it may impact the amount of time prior to which we may need to seek additional capital. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: · approximately $8,350,000 to complete our Phase II clinical trials for HS-110 against non-small lung cancer and the submission of related materials to the FDA or an equivalent amount as grant matching funds to fund an expanded clinical trial; · approximately $1,000,000 for initiation and completion of Phase I clinical trials of HS-410 against bladder cancer; · approximately $100,000 to enhance the scope of and pay regulatory fees for our HS-110 lung cancer investigator-sponsored trial to test the use of HS-110 as a combination therapy against lung cancer; · approximately $1,500,000 to fund one to two additional Phase 1 clinical trials on additional cancer indications; · $300,000 to repay the portion of the loan from Square 1 Bank that is due and payable in the next eighteen months; and · the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including ongoing operations, vendor payables and expansion of the business, further research and development, potential regulatory submissions and hiring additional sales and marketing personnel to support increased sales and marketing activities. · HS-110 non-small cell lung cancer trial. We plan to initiate a 125 patient Phase II trial on patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Our Phase II study has been designed as a maintenance therapy study in patients with Stage III/IV NSCLC who have completed a 1 st line regimen consisting of a platinum doublet, crizotinib or erlotinib and achieved at least stable disease. We plan to use up to approximately $8.35 million from the net proceeds of this offering to finance this trial. We have applied for grant funding to enable us to expand the size and scope of this clinical trial and if the grant funding is received, will use up the $8.35 million of the net proceeds from this offering as 27 matching funds as required by the granting organization to expand the size and scope of our trial. There can be no assurance that the grant funding will be received. If sufficient grant funding is not received by the commencement of the trial to fund the trial, we will use the net proceeds of this offering to provide the needed funding. · HS-410 bladder cancer trial. We plan to file an IND for use of HS-410 to prevent the recurrence of bladder cancer. This initial IND will include a 93 patient, Phase I/II trial to examine safety, tolerability, immune response and preliminary clinical activity of HS-410 in patients with high risk, superficial bladder cancer who have completed surgical resection and 6 weekly intravesical bacillus Calmet-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy installations. We plan to use approximately $1 million from the net proceeds of this offering to enhance the scope of this trial as currently designed and funded. · HS-110 non-small cell lung cancer combination trial . Our HS-110 lung cancer trial is an investigator-sponsored trial to test the use of HS-110 as a combination therapy against lung cancer. While the trial is fully-funded by the Marcus Foundation, we plan to use approximately $100,000 to enhance to scope of this trial and prepare appropriate regulatory filings. · Additional clinical trials . We are creating and have created ImPACT -based drugs against additional cancers and plan to use approximately $1.5 million from the net proceeds of this offering to fund one to two additional Phase 1 clinical trials on additional cancer indications. · Repayment of debt. We plan to use approximately $300,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to repay the portion of the loans from Square 1 Bank that is due and payable in the next eighteen months. One loan from Square 1 Bank is payable on September 7, 2013 in 36 monthly installments of principal and interest. The other loan is payable on August 7, 2013 and August 7, 2014 for 5% of the outstanding principal and accrued interest each and then the remaining principal and accrued interest is due December 14, 2014. Both loans accrue interest monthly at an interest rate of 3% plus prime or 6% per annum whichever is greater. Finally, the last loan is payable as interest only until January 9, 2014 when the entire principal balance is due and it accrues interest monthly at an interest rate of 4.25% per annum. As of May 1, 2013, we had outstanding $725,000 under the Square 1 Bank loans. · The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including ongoing operations, vendor payables and expansion of the business, further research and development, potential regulatory submissions and hiring additional sales and marketing personnel to support increased sales and marketing activities. The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current intentions based on our present plans and business conditions. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received from this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors including the progress in, and costs of, our clinical trials and other preclinical development programs and the amount of funding, if any, received from grants. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of management regarding the application of the net proceeds from the offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate the net proceeds of this offering; however any such reallocation would be substantially limited to the categories set forth above to use the net proceeds for other purposes. Pending such uses set forth above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in government securities and other short-term investment grade, marketable securities. 28 DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Any future determination to pay dividends, if any, on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual restrictions. 29 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our capitalization as of December 31, 2012: · on an actual basis; · on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2012, to reflect the automatic conversion upon the closing of this offering of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into 1,978,036 shares of common stock; and · on a pro forma as-adjusted basis to give effect to the sale of shares of the common stock we are offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated price range shown on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We calculate net tangible book value per share by dividing our net tangible book value, which is tangible assets less total liabilities less debt discounts related to debt to be paid or converted as a result of this offering, by the number of outstanding shares of our common stock. Prior to considering the effects of the proceeds of this offering, but giving effect to the automatic conversion of our outstanding shares of Series A, Series 1 and Series B Preferred Stock into 3,869,455 shares of our common stock upon completion of this offering and the conversion of promissory notes and accrued interest in the amount of $ million, at a conversion price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, into an aggregate of shares of our common stock, our pro forma net tangible book value (deficit) as of December 31, 2012 was approximately $( ) million, or approximately $( ) per share. Upon completion of this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value as of December 31, 2012 will be approximately $( ) million or approximately $( ) per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of $ per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $ per share to new investors purchasing our common stock in this offering. The following table illustrates the per share dilution: Assumed initial public offering price per share $ Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of December 31, 2012 Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering Dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to new investors $ Each $1.00 increase in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase our pro forma net tangible book value by approximately $ million, the pro forma net tangible book value per share by approximately $ per share and the dilution to investors purchasing shares of our common stock in this offering by approximately $ per share, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The information above assumes that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value will increase to $( ) per share, representing an immediate increase to existing stockholders of $ per share and an immediate dilution of $ per share to new investors. If any shares are issued upon exercise of outstanding options or warrants, new investors will experience further dilution.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors, Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this prospectus. Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel allogeneic, off-the-shelf cellular therapeutic vaccines to combat a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. Our proprietary ImPACT cancer therapy delivers live, genetically-modified, irradiated human cells which are reprogrammed to pump out a broad spectrum of cancer associated antigens together with a potent immune adjuvant called gp96 to educate and activate a cancer patients immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. The secreted antigen-adjuvant complexes are designed to generate an anti-cancer immune response in patients by mobilizing and activating killer T cells that target multiple cancer antigens, thus harnessing a patients own immune system to fight cancer. In a phase I clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC), in which 18 patients were vaccinated and 15 patients remained at the end of the trial and were evaluated, we believe our off-the-shelf therapeutic vaccine candidate HS-110 generated anti-cancer immune responses in 11 patients (including the mobilization and activation of killer T cells against multiple cancer antigens), was generally well tolerated and demonstrated preliminary indications of clinical efficacy. As an off-the-shelf therapeutic vaccine, ImPACT uses a common master cell line to mass-produce a single vaccine product applicable to all patients for each particular cancer type, and thus, we believe, providing a traditional biopharmaceutical approach to deliver pan-antigen immunotherapy with logistical, manufacturing and cost of goods benefits compared to autologous patient-specific approaches. We are in the process of initiating a Phase II clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with our therapeutic vaccine candidate HS-110, which is derived from a genetically-modified human lung cancer cell line. The results of our recently completed Phase I clinical trial in lung cancer patients demonstrated that HS-110 was generally well tolerated with minimal indications of treatment-related toxicity with positive correlations between levels of observed immune responses and therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, the trial demonstrated a response rate in 11 of 15 patients and a median survival of 16.5 months for immune responders, versus a median survival of 4.5 months for immune non-responders. These findings were consistent with those of our multiple pre-clinical published studies. We have also developed ImPACT therapeutic vaccines for bladder cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. We plan to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial for bladder cancer in mid 2013 with HS-410, a genetically-modified bladder cancer cell line. To date, in excess of $14,000,000 of funding has been awarded to the primary inventor of the technology that we license by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and through other research and clinical grant in order to fund development of the technology that we license. We have little control over the direction of the NIH grant funds that have been received by the primary inventor of the technology we license and since payment is made to the inventor as opposed to us we do not recognize any revenue from such grant funds nor do they fund any expenses that we incur. Although earmarked for further development of the technology that we license, any funds awarded to the primary inventor are used in his discretion and we have little control over his use of the funds. The actual amount of funds we will need to complete our 93-patient, Phase I/II trial of HS-410 is estimated to be $3.5 million of which $1,000,000 will be derived from the net proceeds of this offering and is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: · the progress and cost of our research and development activities; · the number and scope of our research and development programs; · the progress and cost of our preclinical and clinical development activities; 34 · our ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements; · our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements; · the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and · the costs and timing of regulatory approvals. Recent Developments In March 2013, we closed the first tranche of our Series B Preferred Stock private placement offering in which we sold an aggregate of 1,891,419 shares of our Series B-1 Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $5,050,090. The investors in the offering committed to purchase and we agreed to sell an additional 433,122 shares of our Series B-2 Preferred Stock at a second tranche closing to be held after fulfillment of certain conditions including receipt of $16,750,000 in grant funding. In addition, at the second tranche closing, each investor will receive a warrant exercisable for two shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock for each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock purchased by such investor at the second tranche closing. All shares of Series B Preferred Stock automatically convert into shares of our common stock upon the consummation of a firm commitment underwritten public offering resulting in aggregate net cash proceeds to us of at least $15,000,000. Critical Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize government grants when there is reasonable assurance that they will comply with the conditions attached to the grants and that the grants will be received. The grants are recognized using an income approach and grant revenue is recognized as the related expenses are incurred. Stock Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and non-employee directors using a fair value method which requires the recognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based payments, including stock options. The fair value method requires us to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value of the underlying option calculated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates and expected term. The expected volatility rates are estimated based on the actual volatility of comparable public companies over the expected term. The expected term for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future and, accordingly, uses an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards. The measurement of nonemployee share-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest and is recognized as an expense over the period over which services are received. The fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined at each grant date by our board of directors and supported by periodic independent third-party valuations. Our board of directors intended all options to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share price fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. For grants of stock awards made on dates for which there was no valuation performed by a valuation specialist, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based upon the immediately preceding valuation and other pertinent information (such as significant changes in our activities) available at the time of grant. 35 We have granted stock options during the period from January 1, 2011 through May 1, 2013 as summarized below: Option Grant Dates: Number of Options Granted Exercise Price Per Share Common Stock Fair Value Per Share At Grant Date Fair Value Per Option April 7, 2011 29,000 $0.28 $0.28 $0.1677 April 7, 2011 250,000 $0.31 $0.28 $0.1379 April 12, 2011 362,250 $0.28 $0.28 $0.1707 October 25, 2011 48,000 $0.28 $0.28 $0.1886 October 25, 2011 15,000 $0.28 $0.28 $0.2036 October 25, 2011 50,000 $0.28 $0.28 $0.1677 November 22, 2011 50,000 $0.28 $0.28 $0.1770 April 25, 2012 225,595 $0.33 $0.33 $0.1894 April 25, 2012 5,000 $0.33 $0.33 $0.1968 May 30, 2012 3,000 $0.33 $0.33 $0.1968 November 8, 2012 177,500 $0.33 $0.97 $0.6091 April 29, 2013 78,500 $0.97 $0.97 $0.7029 Three valuations were performed by independent valuation specialists on March 31, 2011, March 31, 2012, and December 31, 2012. To determine the fair value of the common stock, we considered three enterprise value allocation methods consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. These methods are: (i) current-value method; (ii) the option pricing method; and (iii) the probability-weighted expected return method. Under the option pricing method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preference at the time of a liquidity event. The option-pricing method uses the Black-Scholes option model to price the call options. After considering several factors and circumstances, we utilized the option pricing backsolve method. The option pricing backsolve method treats common stock and Preferred Stock as call options on the enterprise/equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock. In order to estimate the fair value of the equity as of March 31, 2011, we did an option pricing backsolve method based on the recently issued convertible note. In May 2010 and September 2010, we completed the issuance of convertible promissory notes with an unrelated party which was considered to be at arms-length. We estimated the implied equity value to be approximately $3.4 million as of March 31, 2011. After consideration of specific facts and circumstances, the board of directors and management assumed a 3.5 years to a liquidity event. The anticipated timing and probability of a liquidity event was based on then-current plans and estimates of our board of directors and management regarding a liquidity event. Furthermore, volatility was estimated based on 3.5-year historical volatility of peer companies. To derive the value of the common stock, the proceeds to the common stockholders were calculated based on the preferences and priorities of the preferred and common stock, including the participation features of certain series of the preferred shares. A discount in the amount of 40% for lack of marketability was applied to reflect the risk arising from the inability to readily sell the shares. The discount for lack of marketability was based on our size, pre-profit stage, attraction to outside investors, and expectation of liquidity. After applying the 40% discount for lack marketability, we concluded the fair value of our common stock on a minority, non-marketable basis to be $0.28 per share. To determine the fair value of our common stock as of March 31, 2012, we considered two scenarios based on the specific facts and our circumstances as of March 31, 2012. As of March 31, 2012, we had specific needs of cash in order to continue operations. As such, we were planning a series B round of financing. Based on the specific facts and circumstances, the first scenario assumes we will raise the Series B round of financing (Going Concern) and the second scenario assumes the Company will liquidate in the next three months (Liquidation Scenario). Under the first scenario, the fair value of the common stock was determined by applying the option pricing backsolve method. A 5-year to liquidity was assumed by management and the board of directors based on the anticipated timing and probability of a liquidity event. Volatility was assumed based on historical volatility of peer companies. In order to estimate the implied equity value, we assumed terms and conditions based on the Series B 36 round of financing. An option pricing backsolve method was applied to determine the value of the equity based on the anticipated Series B round of financing, which was expected to occur during the latter half of 2012 with an unrelated investor. Under the second scenario, the fair value of the common stock was determined by applying the current method given the immediate liquidity event. Our management and our board of directors (the Board) assumed that we will liquidate in the next three months. Given the facts and circumstances, we assumed that there would be no proceeds available for distribution to the common stockholders, indicating the fair value of the common stock to be zero. After considering both scenarios, a weighted average of the current value approach and the OPM was calculated to estimate the fair value of the common stock as of March 31, 2012. A discount in the amount of 40% for lack of marketability was applied to reflect the risk arising from the inability to readily sell the shares. The discount for lack of marketability was based on our size, pre-profit stage, attraction to outside investors, and expectation of liquidity. After applying the 40% discount for lack marketability present in the common stock, we concluded the fair value of our common stock on a minority, non-marketable basis to be $0.33 per share. To determine the fair value of the common stock as of December 31, 2012, the Company utilized the probability-weighted return method (PWERM) to allocate the total equity value to the various securities, including Preferred Stock warrants. The PWERM model reflected our continued development, including the anticipation of the closing of Series B-1 convertible Preferred Stock financing. The PWERM is a scenario-based analysis that estimates the value per share based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns, considering each of four future scenarios: an immediate IPO, a delayed IPO, a sale or merger, or liquidation. The equity is allocated pro rata among the total common shares on as-converted basis. The value per share under each scenario was then probability weighted and the resulting weighted values were summed to determine the fair value per share for each class. Our calculated discounts for the lack of marketability through the use of the Black-Scholes-Option Pricing Model, and applied an implied discount for marketability of 20.5% for the immediate IPO scenario, 29% for the delayed IPO scenario, and 61.7% for the sale or merger scenario. The expected outcomes were weighted based on a probability of forty percent (40%) for the liquidation scenario, with a lower probability for an IPO scenario of twenty-five percent (25%) and a probability of thirty-five percent (35%) for the sale or merger scenario. The fair values of the equity determined using the IPO and non-IPO scenarios were weighted according to our estimate of the probability of each scenario. Based on the PWERM model, the Board of Directors determined the fair value of our common stock at November 8, 2012 to be $0.97. On April 7, 2011, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 29,000 and 250,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.28 and $0.31, respectively. We determined that the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant was $0.28 per share. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value on this date, we considered: · the independent valuation report of March 31, 2011 that indicated a valuation price of $0.28 per share; and · that there were no material changes in factors impacting the common stock per share value from March 31, 2011 to April 7, 2011. On April 12, 2011, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 326,250 shares at an exercise price of $0.28. We determined that the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant was $0.28 per share. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value on this date, we considered: · the independent valuation report of March 31, 2011 that indicated a valuation price of $0.28 per share; and · that there were no material changes in factors impacting the common stock per share value from March 31, 2011 to April 12, 2011. On October 25, 2011, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 113,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.28. We determined that the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant was $0.28 per share. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value on this date, we considered: · the independent valuation report of March 31, 2011 that indicated a valuation price of $0.28 per share; and 37 · that there were no material changes in factors impacting the common stock per share value from March 31, 2011 to October 25, 2011. On November 22, 2011, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 50,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.28. We determined that the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant was $0.28 per share. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value on this date, we considered: · the independent valuation report of March 31, 2011 that indicated a valuation price of $0.28 per share; and · that there were no material changes in factors impacting the common stock per share value from March 31, 2011 to November 22, 2011. On April 25, 2012, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 230,595 shares at an exercise price of $0.33. We determined that the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant was $0.33 per share. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value on this date, we considered: · the independent valuation report of March 31, 2012 that indicated a valuation price of $0.33 per share; and · that there were no material changes in factors impacting the common stock per share value from March 31, 2012 to April 25, 2012. On May 30, 2012, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 3,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.33. We determined that the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant was $0.33 per share. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value on this date, we considered: · the independent valuation report of March 31, 2012 that indicated a valuation price of $0.33 per share; and · that there were no material changes in factors impacting the common stock per share value from March 31, 2012 to May 30, 2012. On November 8, 2012, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 177,500 shares at an exercise price of $0.33. We determined that the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant was $0.97 per share. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value on this date, we considered: · the independent valuation report of December 31, 2012 that indicated a valuation price of $0.97 per share. · that there were no material changes in factors impacting the common stock per share value from November 8, 2012 to December 31, 2012. On April 29, 2013, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 78,500 shares at an exercise price of $0.97. We determined that the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant was $0.97 per share. To assess the reasonableness of our fair value on this date, we considered: · the independent valuation report of December 31, 2012 that indicated a valuation price of $0.97 per share; and · that there were no material changes in factors impacting the common stock per share value from December 31, 2012 to April 29, 2013. Preferred Stock Warrant Liability We account for our freestanding warrants to purchase our Series A Preferred Stock as liabilities at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The warrants may only be settled in shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The warrants are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date, and the change in fair value, if any, is recognized as other income (expense). We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of (i) exercise of the warrants; (ii) conversion of the warrants into warrants to purchase common stock upon 38 an event such as the completion of an initial public offering; or (iii) expiration of the warrants. Upon conversion, the Preferred Stock warranty liability will be reclassified into additional paid-in capital. We used a Monte Carlo simulation in evaluating the fair value of the warrants, taking into consideration the down-round protection feature included within the warrant agreement. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of the warrants were as follows: December 31, 2012 2011 Exercise price $2.10 $2.10 Risk-free interest rate 1.78% 1.65%-1.92% Expected volatility 75.6-76.3% 75.1-76.7% Expected life (years) 10 10 Expected dividend yield 0% 0% Material Weaknesses in our Internal Control. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We have historically operated as a private company and the number and qualifications of our finance and accounting staff have not been consistent with those of a public company. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls with respect to our financial statement closing process of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Our management discovered certain conditions that we deemed to be material weaknesses in our internal controls, as follows: · A lack of accounting and finance resources as well as effective oversight by those in charge of governance resulted in insufficient controls over timely financial statement preparation and review as well as the preparation and review around accounting for certain complex transactions. · The design of monitoring controls used to assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls is inadequate. We also do not have an adequate internal process to report deficiencies in internal control to management on a timely basis. We have begun to take actions that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified. In response to the identification of our material weaknesses, we (i) intend to hire additional finance and accounting personnel; (ii) are in the process of establishing a review process for key aspects of our financial reporting process, including the accounting for complex transactions; and (iii) will seek to establish better operating controls and involve our board of directors in our internal controls process, which will involve establishing formal procedures to communicate deficiencies in internal controls on a timely basis, and encourage our board of directors to more actively participate in guiding management as it relates to internal controls matters. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. Regardless, following the completion of this offering we will be required to expend time and resources to further improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our finance and accounting staff. Results of Operations For Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 Revenues Total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, decreased approximately 98% to $3,110 as compared to $187,787 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. For both periods our revenue was entirely comprised of grant awards. In October 2010, we were awarded a grant from the Internal Revenue Service of $244,479 for the reimbursement of qualified investments in a therapeutic discovery project under section 48 of the 39 Internal Revenue Service Code. The grant proceeds were paid in two installments of which $162,435 was paid in 2011 and was included in revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. We plan to continue our efforts to secure future grant funding to subsidize our ongoing research and developments costs. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are primarily comprised of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, research and development expenses represented approximately 38% of operating expenses, clinical trials and regulatory represented approximately 11% of operating expenses, and general and administrative expenses represented approximately 51% of operating expenses. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, research and development expenses represented approximately 56% of operating expenses, clinical trials and research represented approximately 11% of operating expenses, and general and administrative expenses represented approximately 33% of operating expenses. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, total operating expenses increased 5.5% to $2,345,787 from $2,222,587 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Research and development expenses decreased approximately 28% to $902,938 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 from $1,246,587 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. This decline was due to expenses of approximately $162,000 for a large research project and approximately $146,000 for past patent expenses to the University of Miami which were incurred during 2011. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, approximately $330,699 and $94,397 of the research and development expenses were attributable solely to research related to our lung cancer and ovarian cancer projects, respectively, and the balance of such expenses were not attributable solely to any one project but were attributable to research relevant to all of our projects. Also, research and development manufacturing costs decreased by approximately $101,000 as manufacturing was being phased into the clinical and regulatory phase. Clinical trials and regulatory expenses decreased approximately .08% to $253,189 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, from $255,210 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, which is consistent between the two periods. General and administrative expenses increased approximately 65% to $1,189,660 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, from $720,790 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of our decision to retain a full-time CEO in the second quarter of 2011 which resulted in additional expense of $200,450. Additionally, we incurred additional expenses of $72,723 for a contracted and full-time accounting staff. Finally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 we incurred additional insurance expenses of $13,348 associated with enhanced risk management such as Directors and Officers Insurance and additional liability coverage, additional rent expense and administrative expenses of $31,641 due primarily to the execution of a new lease, additional stock compensation expense of approximately $138,350, additional financing costs of approximately $38,000, and additional audit fees of approximately $24,000. The additional unspecified increase in the general and administrative expense was attributable to our expansion. Non-Operating Expenses Non-Operating Expenses was primarily comprised of interest expense from our convertible notes and the 2012 write off of the debt discount associated with debt paid off during the period which increased to $101,086 for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $63,173 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net Loss Our net loss after deducting the non-controlling interest increased 15% to $2,420,200 for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $2,104,884 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Although research and development costs declined by 28% due to decreased patent expenditures, the maturation of the company required additional staffing. A Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory was hired to manage our clinical trials as well as a full time Director of Finance. Additionally, the salary of the CEO was increased as stipulated in his employment agreement. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations since inception primarily through proceeds from equity financings and debt financings, primarily involving private sales of our common stock and other debt and equity securities, and to a lesser extent from the proceeds from grant awards and commitments from banks and vendors. 40 In March 2013, we closed the first tranche of our Series B Preferred Stock private placement offering in which we sold an aggregate of 1,891,419 shares of our Series B-1 Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $5,050,090. The investors in the offering committed to purchase and we agreed to sell an additional 433,122 shares of our Series B-2 Preferred Stock at a second tranche closing to be held after fulfillment of certain conditions including receipt of $16,750,000 in grant funding. In addition, at the second tranche closing, each investor will receive a warrant exercisable for two shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock for each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock purchased by them at the second tranche closing. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $5,030 as of December 31, 2012, a decrease of $93,616 from December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the primary sources of cash were issuances of stock and the draw downs on Square 1s promissory notes. In 2012, $725,000 was drawn on the Square 1 promissory notes and the outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2012 was $725,000. As of May 1, 2013, the Company has outstanding $725,000 on the promissory notes, with $2,275,000 available for future use. The Tranche A Loan principal balance is $500,000, the interest rate is currently at 6%, and the maturity date is August 7, 2016. The Term Loan B principal balance is $225,000, the interest rate is 4.25%, and the maturity date is December 14, 2014. The primary use of cash during the year ended December 31, 2011 was for working capital requirements. Since inception we have raised $2,623,709 from the issuance of convertible notes to investors, of which notes in the principal amount of $2,273,709 were issued to one investor, Brightline Ventures III, LLC, the managing member of which is Mr. Smith, a member of our Board. As of December 31, 2010, we had notes outstanding to three investors in the aggregate principal amount of $1,176,000. The notes accrued interest at a rate of 3% per annum and were scheduled to mature 18 months after issuance. In 2011, we raised an additional $1,447,709 from the issuance of notes to three investors, one of which was Brightline Ventures III, LLC. The notes accrued interest at a rate of 3% per annum and were scheduled to mature 18 months after issuance. All of the notes were converted into shares of Series A Preferred Stock in September 2011. Our continued operations will primarily depend on our ability to raise additional capital from various sources, including equity and debt financings, as well as grants and bank financings. On October 20, 2011, we entered into an agreement with a vendor that allowed us to make up to $950,000 of payments for invoiced services rendered by such vendor through the issuance of a convertible note. In May 2013, the note with the vendor was extinguished and the vendor extended the due date of all payables owed , including amounts previously due under the Note, until the closing of this offering. On December 14, 2011, we entered into a promissory note with the North Carolina Biotechnology Center pursuant to which we could borrow up to $250,000. The note accrued interest at a rate of 4.25% per annum. The principal was payable in annual installments in the amount of five percent (5%) of the outstanding principal as of the date of such payment, commencing on the anniversary date of the related loan agreement and continuing annually on the same day of each calendar period thereafter until December 13, 2014. In August 2012, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the note from the proceeds of the Square 1 Bank loan described below. In connection with the loan from North Carolina Biotechnology Center, we issued the North Carolina Biotechnology Center a warrant exercisable for 29,762 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.10 per share, which warrant expires on December 13, 2021. In August 2012, we entered into a secured loan with Square 1 Bank, the proceeds of which were used in part to pay off the loan from North Carolina Biotechnology Center. The loan and security agreement that we entered with Square 1 Bank in connection with the secured loan (the Square 1 Agreement) provides that Square 1 Bank will provide us with a term loan in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1,000,000 to be used for working capital and capital expenditures (the Tranche A Loan). The Tranche A Loan will be available to us until August 7, 2013. The Tranche A Loan is payable on August 7, 2013 in 36 monthly installments of principal and accrued interest. The Tranche A Loan matures on August 7, 2016. If we receive a grant that provides aggregate funds with a value of $16,000,000, the maximum aggregate of the Tranche A Loan and the Tranche B Loan amount increases to $2,775,000. Both the Tranche A Loan and the Tranche B Loan accrue interest monthly at an interest rate of 3% plus prime or 6% per annum whichever is greater. The Square 1 Agreement, as amended, also provides that if we receive at least $4,500,000 from the sale of our equity to investors after February 15, 2013 but on or before March 31, 2013 (such date we receive such funds being referred to as the Trigger Date), we can borrow an additional term loan in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1,000,000 to be used for working capital and capital expenditures (the Tranche B Loan). Due to the closing of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock private placement in March 2013, we will be able to borrow an additional $1,000,000 under such loan. The Tranche B Loan is payable as interest-only prior to the twelve month anniversary of the Trigger Date month after until August 7, 2013 and thereafter is payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest until August 7, 2016. The Tranche B Loan matures on August 7, 2016. Square 1 41 Bank also made one term loan in the amount of $225,000, which was used to repay our debt to North Carolina Biotechnology Center (the Term B Loan). The Term B Loan matures December 14, 2014 and requires payments on the one and two year anniversary of the date of issuance equal to five percent of the principal amount of the loan plus accrued interest, with the balance of the loan being paid on maturity. The Term B Loan accrues interest monthly at an interest rate of 4.25% per annum. Once repaid the loans may not be re-borrowed. The loans are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, including our stock in our subsidiaries but excluding our intellectual property. Finally, Square 1 Bank also made one Non-Formula Advance (the Non-Formula Advance) in the aggregate principal amount of $200,000 which is payable as interest-only on the 5 th calendar day of each month through January 9, 2014 when the entire principal amount is due. As of May 1, 2013, we had outstanding $725,000 under the Square 1 Bank loans. In connection with the loan, we issued Square 1 Bank a warrant exercisable for 17,500 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. The warrant is exercisable for ten years at a price of $2.10, which price is subject to adjustment for certain transactions including certain dilutive transactions. The warrant holder is entitled to piggyback registration rights with respect to the underlying shares. The loan and security agreement with Square 1 Bank sets forth various affirmative and negative covenants that the Company must comply with, including covenants regarding financial reporting, and cash maintenance burn requirements, incurrence of indebtedness and mergers and acquisitions. We plan to use approximately $300,000 of the proceeds of this offering to repay the portion of the loans from Square 1 Bank due over the 12 months beginning September 2013. We currently have: (i) $500,000 outstanding under the Tranche A Loan and under the terms of the loan we are required to pay the principal balance plus accrued interest in 36 monthly installments beginning September 7, 2013 and ending August 7, 2016 and (ii) $225,000 outstanding under the Term Loan B, and under the terms of the loan we are required to make payments of 5% of the outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest each on August 2013 and 2014, with the remaining principal balance, plus all accrued interest, due December 14, 2014. In 2012 we borrowed $200,000 under the Non-Formula Advance from Square 1 Bank which was repaid in full in 2013 and $200,000 cannot be reborrowed. In April 2010, we were awarded a grant award from the National Institute of Health in the amount of $300,000, of which $248,648 was paid to us in 2011. In October 2010, we were awarded a grant from the Internal Revenue Service of $244,479, of which $162,435 was paid in 2011. Current and Future Financing Needs We have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $5,935,282 as of December 31, 2012. We have incurred negative cash flows from operations since we started our business. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development efforts, our clinical trials, and our research and discovery efforts. The actual amount of funds we will need to complete our 125 patient Phase II trial on patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and a 93 patient, Phase I/II trial of HS-410, in bladder cancer which is estimated to be $9,350,000, is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: · the progress and cost of our research and development activities; · the number and scope of our research and development programs; · the progress and cost of our preclinical and clinical development activities; · our ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements; · our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements; · the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and · the costs and timing of regulatory approvals. We have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We continue to require additional funds to fully implement our planned research and development and may need to obtain these funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential sources of financing include corporate partnerships or public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. We do not have any committed sources of financing at this time other than as described previously and there can be no assurance given that any additional 42 funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.

On December 19, 2012, we entered into a lease modification agreement which extended the lease term until July 31, 2013 and the monthly rent increased to $4,046. Future minimum lease payments are as set forth above. Below is a table of our contractual payments under the Companys notes payable agreements for the years 2013 through 2016 (in thousands) : Year ended December 31, 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total Notes Payable $ 104 $ 403 $ 178 $ 113 $ 798 Total $ 104 $ 403 $ 178 $ 113 $ 798 43 BUSINESS Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel allogeneic, off-the-shelf cellular therapeutic vaccines to combat a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. Our proprietary ImPACT gp96-Ig cancer therapy is being designed to deliver live, genetically-modified, irradiated human cells that are reprogrammed to pump out a broad spectrum of cancer associated antigens together with a potent immune adjuvant called gp96 to educate and activate a cancer patients immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. We intend for our ImPACT cells to secrete an antigen-adjuvant complex that generates anti-cancer immune responses in patients by mobilizing and activating killer T cells that target multiple cancer antigens, thus harnessing a patients own immune system to fight cancer. In a phase I clinical trial in NSCLC, we believe our off-the-shelf therapeutic vaccine candidate HS-110 generated anti-cancer immune responses in patients (including the mobilization and activation of killer T cells against multiple cancer antigens), was generally well tolerated and demonstrated preliminary indications of clinical efficacy. Unlike autologous or personalized therapeutic vaccine approaches which require extraction and processing of cancer or blood from each individual, our ImPACT therapeutic vaccine uses a common master cell line to mass-produce a single vaccine product applicable to all patients for each particular cancer type. We believe our off-the-shelf, allogenic immunotherapy offers logistical, manufacturing and cost of goods benefits compared to autologous patient-specific approaches. We have filed an IND to initiate a Phase II clinical trial in NSCLC patients with our therapeutic vaccine candidate HS-110, which is derived from a genetically-modified human lung cancer cell line. We believe that the results of our recently completed Phase I clinical trial in NSCLC demonstrated that our HS-110 is designed to generate anti-cancer immune responses. Eighteen patients were vaccinated, and 15 of the 18 vaccinated patients completed the first course of three planned courses of therapy. Based on our evaluation, 11 of 15 patients responded to our therapy with a median survival of 16.5 months for immune responders, versus a median survival of 4.5 months for immune non-responders and the historical control group. The one-year overall survival rate of patients in our study was 44%, comparing quite favorably with the 5% rate for the historical control group. One of our late-stage lung cancer patients is surviving over four years since starting our therapy and another patient is surviving over three years since starting our therapy. These findings were consistent with multiple pre-clinical published studies on ImPACT therapy. We have also developed ImPACT therapeutic vaccines for bladder cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. We plan to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial for bladder cancer in mid-2013 with HS-410, a genetically-modified bladder cancer cell line. We also plan to initiate a second grant-funded, investigator-sponsored Phase I clinical trial of our ImPACT therapy against SCLC in the second quarter of 2013. To date, in excess of $14,000,000 of funding has been awarded to the primary inventor of the technology we license by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and through other research and clinical grants, which has been used to further develop our ImPACT technology platform that we license. We have little control over the direction of the NIH grant funds that have been received by the primary inventor of the technology we license and since payment is made to the inventors as opposed to us we do not recognize any revenue from such grant funds nor do they fund any expenses that we incur. Although earmarked for further development of the technology that we license, any funds awarded to the primary inventor are used in his discretion and we have little control over his use of the funds. 44 The table below summarizes our current product candidates and their stages of development: Product Candidate Indication Phase of Development Upcoming Milestone(s) HS-110 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Completed Phase I; Phase II IND Currently on File. 2013 - Initiate Phase II HS-410 Bladder Cancer Adjuvant Completing cGMP Drug Manufacturing 2013 - Initiate Phase I/II HS-110 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Combination Therapy Completed cGMP Drug Manufacturing 2013 - Initiate Phase I HS-310 Ovarian Cancer Initiating cGMP Manufacturing 2014 - Phase I/II trials HS-510 Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Cell line development underway 2014 - Phase I/II trials HS-HIV HIV NIH-sponsored Primate Studies Complete Additional studies underway We plan to begin clinical trials against breast and ovarian cancer in 2014, pending receipt of additional grants or financing. The NIH is also currently fully funding an advanced study of our HS-HIV product candidate in non-human primates with a therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine for the treatment and prevention of HIV utilizing our ImPACT approach. ImPACT TherapyNovel Pan-Antigen Immune Activation Our ImPACT therapy is a novel technology platform designed to educate and stimulate the immune system to combat specific disease targets, such as cancer cells. ImPACT utilizes live attenuated, human-derived, genetically-modified cells to generate an array of cellular antigens and secrete an essential immunostimulatory protein called gp96-Ig. The secreted proteins are designed to generate an immune response to cancer cells by mobilizing and activating a patients own killer T cells to recognize and attack a broad array of different tumor antigens with the goal of eliminating cancer cells. In contrast with other vaccine technologies that target only one antigen, ImPACTs pan-antigen approach which may enable the body to induce and maintain an immune response against a broad array of tumor-specific proteins, by potentially providing a more robust immune response and limiting cancer cells ability to evade the immune system. We believe our clinical and pre-clinical results suggest that ImPACT generates anti-tumor immune responses capable of targeting and destroying tumors. We believe our novel, off-the-shelf, live cell therapy has the potential to be used to not only combat a wide range of cancers, but also against various infectious diseases, such as hepatitis C, malaria and HIV, for which non-human primate studies, which we believe are encouraging, have been completed. We have leveraged our existing infrastructure by developing additional clinical candidates in areas where we can use our proprietary technology. Our success will depend on the clinical and regulatory success of our product candidates and our ability to retain, on commercially reasonable terms, financial and managerial resources, which are currently limited. To date, we have not received regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or derived any revenues from their sales. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will ever receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or derive any revenues from their sales. We should have sufficient capital from the offering to operate the company for 24-30 months. Our ImPACT Therapy Product Candidates We plan to initiate our Phase II clinical trial with HS-110, our lead drug candidate, against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our Phase II trial will expand upon the Phase I results as described below. We also plan to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial against bladder cancer in mid-2013 using our HS-410 drug candidate, which is currently being manufactured in accord with cGMP production guidelines. We plan to utilize this drug as an immunotherapy to prevent the recurrence of bladder cancer in post-resected bladder cancer patients. We are also anticipating initiating clinical trials using our ImPACT -based product candidates against a number of other diseases, including ovarian cancer and breast cancer. 45 Our Product Candidates and Clinical Development Programs Our development program involves testing our ImPACT -based product candidates against a number of disease targets, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer and HIV. We are planning to enter a Phase II clinical trial with our first therapeutic vaccine, HS-110, for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We are also planning to initiate a Phase I clinical trial of HS-410 for bladder cancer in mid-2013. In addition, we may also initiate Phase I clinical trials for breast and/or ovarian cancer in 2014, dependent upon the receipt of additional non-dilutive grants and/or product financings. We have an ongoing advanced study in non-human primates with a therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine for the treatment and prevention of HIV. This ongoing study is fully funded by the NIH. Strengths and Competitive Advantages · We believe our ImPACT technology combines broad antigen targeting complexed with a potent immune adjuvant. We believe ImPACT has already been shown to activate the immune system against a wide variety of antigens by eliciting a significant cytotoxic T cell immune response as measured by extensive pre-clinical and clinical immunological testing. The activated immune response generated by our ImPACT Therapy may be useful in treating wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. · We have filed an IND to initiate a Phase II clinical trial in NSCLC patients with our therapeutic vaccine candidate HS-110, which is derived from a genetically-modified human lung cancer cell line. We expect to initiate Phase I/II clinical trials for bladder cancer with our second product candidate, HS-410, in mid-2013. · The National Institute of Health (NIH) and other organizations have provided funding to the primary inventor of the technology that we license for both our pre-clinical and clinical studies. · Our proprietary technology platform, ImPACT , is being applied to develop multiple therapeutic vaccines against a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. We believe we have many opportunities to generate positive results and to gain FDA approval, which lowers our dependence on any one drug in order to generate returns. · We believe our therapeutic vaccines are easier and less expensive to manufacture than autologous vaccines because our therapeutic vaccines do not require the harvesting of blood and/or cancer cells from each patient in order to manufacture a course of treatment. We believe this is highly advantageous because it can bring the logistics, manufacturing, cost and distribution of our therapeutic vaccines within the purview of traditional biopharmaceutical product channels and dramatically expand our pool of corporate partners. · We believe our technology can readily be adapted to incorporate new cancer types. Because of this, and the fact that our vaccine approach is allogeneic ( “ off-the-shelf ” ), we are able to rapidly develop new vaccines for different types of cancers and other diseases. · Our therapy does not require an adjuvant. Some vaccines require the addition of another drug, called an adjuvant, to enhance their effectiveness. Adjuvants typically cause irritation at the injection site. As HS-110 is itself an adjuvant, we do not have to use additional adjuvants to generate and maintain an activated immune response. · We believe our business model is capital efficient as we continue to leverage academic and institutional resources to develop new products and to move these products into and through clinical trials. 46 Strategy Our objective is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development and commercialization of allogeneic, off-the-shelf therapeutic vaccines. We are focused on discovering, developing and applying our core platform ImPACT technology towards a number of disease indications. The key elements of our strategy are: · Develop and obtain regulatory approval for our ImPACT-based products . We plan to initiate a Phase II clinical trial against NSCLC and intend to conduct a Phase I/II clinical trial against bladder cancer in mid-2013. Additionally, we plan to initiate clinical trials against breast and ovarian cancer in 2014, pursuant to receiving additional non-dilutive grants and/or product financings. After NSCLC, bladder, breast and ovarian cancers, we plan to initiate additional clinical trials against other disease targets utilizing our ImPACT technology platform. · Maximize commercial opportunity for our ImPACT technology . Our product candidates target large markets with significant unmet medical need. For each of our product candidates, we seek to retain all manufacturing, marketing and distribution rights which should give us the ability to maximize the economic potential of any future U.S. or international corporate partnerships. We believe that we should be well positioned to successfully commercialize our product candidates independently or through U.S. and international corporate partnerships . · Further expand our broad patent portfolio. We have made a significant investment in the development of our patent portfolio to protect our technologies and programs, and we intend to continue to do so. We have obtained exclusive rights to five different patent families directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to our vaccine platform and preclinical development programs for cancer. These families comprise five PCT applications, six issued patents, one allowed or accepted patent application, and thirty-eight pending patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe, and Japan as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets. · Manage our business with efficiency and discipline. We believe we have efficiently utilized our capital and human resources to develop and acquire our product candidates and programs, and create a broad intellectual property portfolio. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced management team with backgrounds in developing and commercializing product candidates. We use project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic program decisions and to attempt to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline. · Obtain additional grant funding . To more fully develop our ImPACT technology platform and its application to a variety of human diseases, we plan to continue to seek and access external sources of grant funding on our own behalf and in conjunction with our academic partners to support the development of our pipeline programs. While we intend to work with our academic partners to secure additional grant funding, these partners have no obligation to work with us to secure such funding. We also intend to continue to evaluate opportunities and, as appropriate, acquire or license technologies that meet our business objectives. Disease Targets and Markets The Oncology Market The American Cancer Society estimates that 1.66 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer in 2013. The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with an invasive cancer is 45% for men and 38% for women. It is projected that 580,350 Americans will die from cancer in 2013. Despite continuous advances made in the field of cancer research every year, there remains a significant unmet medical need as the overall five-year survival rate for cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2007 is an average of 67%. According to the Center of Disease Control, in 2011, cancer was the second leading cause of mortality in the U.S. (23.2%) behind heart disease (24.1%). The American Cancer Society estimates that one in four deaths in the U.S. is due to cancer. 47 The main treatments for cancer are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There are often, however, significant debilitating effects resulting from these treatments or lingering morbidity associated with these approaches to treatment of cancer. Our goal is to develop compounds that can lengthen survival times and improve the quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Although there are a large number of patients, treatment and management of cancer is performed by a relatively concentrated pool of medical professionals. We plan to reach this prescriber base using a relatively small commercial infrastructure that we intend to develop in the future by either hiring internally, partnering or contracting with one or more third-party entities with an established sales force. These development plans are dependent on our raising additional capital, the success of HS-110, HS-310, HS-410 and HS-510 and any technologies we might develop in the future and successful negotiation of commercial relationships, none of which we have completed to date. We believe, however, assuming the efficacy and safety of HS-110 and any other technology we might acquire, that our experienced management team will raise the capital and establish the commercial relationships necessary for success. Limitations of Current Cancer Therapies We believe current cancer treatment alternatives suffer from a number of limitations that impair their effectiveness in improving patient survival and overall quality of life including: · Toxicity. Chemotherapeutic agents are highly toxic to the human body and very often cause a variety of significant and debilitating side effects, including, but not limited to, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, anemia and mucositis. Some targeted therapeutics have fewer systemic toxicities, but still typically have off-target effects such as gastrointestinal inflammation, severe skin reactions and breathing difficulties. These side effects limit a patient's ability to tolerate treatment and as such can deprive the patient of the potential benefit of additional treatments or treatment combinations that might otherwise destroy or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Once they become aware of the limited efficacy, limited increased survival and potentially significant toxicity of existing treatment alternatives, many patients diagnosed with terminal cancer often choose to limit or forego therapy in order to avoid further compromising their quality of life. Patients with advanced stage cancer also often cannot tolerate cancer therapy, and certain therapies can hasten death as the patient's health further deteriorates from the therapy applied. · Mechanism of action. While many current therapeutic approaches can be effective against specific targeted cells, the efficacy of these therapies on treating cancer over the long term generally is limited by the abundance and diversity of the cancer and tumor cells, which is believed to enable the targeted cells to adapt and become resistant to the current therapeutic approach over time. · Short-term approach. Other than tumor removal in a surgical procedure, curing the cancer is often not the intent or a potential outcome of many current cancer therapies. Rather, survival benefit is the primary focus of many currently marketed and development-stage cancer therapeutics. In this regard, many cancer therapies show only a modest impact on the overall survival of the patients and only affect the length of time that passes after treatment begins and before the patients disease worsens or the patient dies. · Immune system suppression. A weakened immune system not only further inhibits the body's natural ability to fight cancer, but also causes patients to become more susceptible to infections and other diseases. Current approaches to cancer treatment generally involve introduction of an agent, such as a chemical, an antibody or radiation, which causes cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) or inhibit the proliferation of all cells, including immune cells, which has the unintended consequence of indirectly suppressing the immune system. Immunotherapy Overview Our ImPACT technology is a form of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy involves administration of a therapeutic approach that enlists or boosts a subjects immune system in order to fight disease. 48 Commonly recognized successful examples of immunotherapy include prophylactic vaccines , such as, childhood immunizations against infectious diseases such as measles, mumps, and rubella. In these cases, usually weakened (attenuated) or inactivated viruses are injected into the body to educate certain immune system cells to recognize and remember small pieces of viral or bacterial proteins (antigens). If and when an individual is subsequently exposed to this same pathogen, the immune system will recognize these antigens immediately and mount a potent immune response to neutralize and eliminate the pathogenic threat. Therapeutic vaccines , such as ImPACT -based product candidates, operate in a fashion similar to prophylactic vaccines except that therapeutic vaccines are administered the onset of a particular disease. In each case, the human immune system is educated and harnessed to recognize and fight the disease of interest. Cancer can be considered a failure of the immune system to effectively recognize and eliminate inappropriately dividing and multiplying (malignant) cells. Under ordinary circumstances the human immune system continuously monitors and eliminates inappropriately dividing cells. However, for reasons that are not entirely understood, under cancerous conditions the human system fails to recognize malignant cells and such cells evade the immune system and are permitted to inappropriately multiply, grow and metastasize to form tumors which eventually become life threatening. Our therapeutic vaccines are designed to assist the immune system in identifying and eliminating malignant cells. Our approach involves the introduction of cellular antigens that are characteristic of malignant cells with the goal of generating an immune response against the particular form of cancer. In our approach, in addition to introducing a number of cancer-specific antigens, we also introduce a protein known as gp96 which stimulates and primes the immune system in further recognizing cancer antigens and generates a potent and broad pan-antigen immune response against cancerous cells. Immunotherapy Approaches Immunotherapy is designed to stimulate and enhance the bodys natural mechanism for killing cancer cells and virus-infected cells. Generally, immunotherapeutic approaches to treat disease can be separated into two distinct classes, passive and active, based on their mechanism of action. Passive Immunotherapy: Passive immunotherapies generally consist of monoclonal antibodies directed at a single disease-specific enzyme or protein on the surface of the targeted cells with the goal of either killing the targeted cells or preventing them from dividing. Rather than stimulate or otherwise use the bodys immune system to initiate the attack on the disease, the attack is made by the therapy which is produced ex vivo , or outside of the body. These therapies also are not usually personalized for the patient. Active Immunotherapy: Active immunotherapies generally consist of therapies intended to trigger or stimulate the bodys own immune system to fight disease. It is a more specific approach to immunotherapy than passive immunotherapy because active immunotherapies have no direct therapeutic action but rather contain antigens specifically designed to activate the patients own immune system to find and kill the targeted cells that carry the same antigen. Active immunotherapies depend on the patients immune system to seek out and destroy targeted cells or tumors. Most active immunotherapies utilize off-the-shelf antigens, known as defined antigens, rather than individualized, patient specific antigens, and are often paired with adjuvants, which are agents that generally activate the immune system cells to increase immune response. Shortcomings of Immunotherapies: Both passive and active immunotherapy approaches have shortcomings, which include: · Most active immunotherapies use normal, non-mutated, self-antigens which are typically poor at stimulating immune responses, even from healthy immune systems. In fact, the human immune system generally does not generate immune responses against self-antigens. Most passive and active immunotherapies also target one or only a few antigens, which increases the probability that infected cells will escape detection by the immune system and immunotherapy. · Most active immunotherapies employ defined antigens that are not effective against multiple types of cancer. As such, further preclinical development is necessary to help identify the relevant antigens that address the targeted cancer(s). 49 · Most immunotherapies can suffer from toxicity side effects resulting in damage to healthy tissues if the target antigen is absorbed by normal cells in addition to the targeted cancer or virus-infected cells. · Many patients may not be able to mount effective immune responses with immunotherapy due to tumor or virus induced immunosuppression of accessory cells such as CD4+ helper T cells, which are necessary for the immunotherapies to be effective but may be functionally impaired by the patient ’ s disease. · It can be difficult to commercialize immunotherapies based on cells derived from individual patients in a cost-effective manner as a result of the need to use manual processes to produce from a limited amount of patient material multiple doses and to store and ship the individual doses. · Immunotherapies that rely on defined, off-the-shelf antigens or a single targeted antigen may have limited effectiveness because even within the same type of cancer, the genetic makeup and distinct antigens of a tumor can vary significantly from patient to patient. These shortcomings were highlighted by the findings of a study recently published in Nature Medicine (Finak and Park (2008), Stromal gene expression predicts clinical outcome in breast cancer, Nature Medicine, 14, 518  527) where the whole genomes of 50 patients breast cancer tumors were sequenced alongside matching DNA from the same patients healthy cells to identify the genetic alterations present in the cancerous cells. The study found that the genomic pattern of each of the tumors varied significantly. Of the approximately 1,700 gene mutations found in total, most were specific and unique to the individual patients cancerous tumors, and that only three of the genetic mutations occurred in 10% or more of the patients. Although many of the immunotherapies currently in clinical development have shown promising results, we do not believe that any of them utilizes a technology that employs the patients own cancer or virus-infected cells to create a fully personalized immunotherapy that is directly targeted to the patients unique genetic diseas e. Our Solution: ImPACT Therapy We believe our ImPACT Therapy has a number of advantages over existing therapies. These advantages, elaborated below, may enable us to develop commercial products that extend the survival of, and improve the quality of life for, cancer patients: · It is designed to fight cancer by activating the immune system against a wide variety of cancer antigens. · It is intended to continually secrete a wide variety of cancer-associated antigens, thus issuing a broad and sustained pan-antigen cytotoxic T cell attack against the targeted cancer. We believe this broad-based attack increases the probability of destroying the targeted cancer. · It is designed to stimulate a natural immune response against specific cancer cells. We have not observed in our clinical trials or in our numerous published animal studies any serious adverse events that were considered by the trial investigators to be treatment-related. · We believe that the novel mechanism of action, good tolerability and favorable safety profile will enable our ImPACT product candidates to have potential benefits across multiple disease stages and tumor types and in combination with other therapies. We believe our ImPACT technology can be targeted to additional specific tumor types by modifying cells from the cancer type of interest. · Our ImPACT Therapy represents a first-in-class adjuvant that functions as both an immune activator and an antigen-delivery vehicle. ImPACT is the only adjuvant technology platform currently known to us in clinical development that is speci ﬁ c to CD8+ cytotoxic T cell immune response, which is especially important for developing therapeutics in oncology as well as a number of other infectious disease indications. · We believe many patients who are too ill to tolerate chemotherapy due to the associated toxicities may be able to benefit from our ImPACT product candidates. 50 ImPACT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM ImPACT Background Our ImPACT technology represents an allogenic or off-the-shelf method to deliver cancer antigens accompanied by heat shock proteins (HSPs) to illicit an immune response. Heat shock proteins are used as a signaling mechanism by the immune system to identify mutated proteins (antigens), including those from tumor cells. Although always present within certain cells, HSPs are normally only released whenever cells die by necrosis or unnatural cell death (rather than apoptosis or natural programmed cell death) and upon release are recognized by the hosts immune system. Upon detection of HSPs, the immune system can then direct an immune response against any foreign (pathogenic) proteins bound to the heat shock protein at the time the cell that released it died by necrosis. When a cell dies an unnatural death through a process called necrosis, such as when it is infected and killed by a flu virus or other pathogen, it breaks open and emits its contents including HSPs into the surrounding tissue. Because heat shock proteins very rarely leave cells, the immune system has evolved to recognize heat shock proteins that have been released from dying cells as the sentries of a molecular alarm system. HSPs have several functions including: · Protecting tissues from pathogens by activating the immune system. · Acting as a chaperone to: o Facilitate proper protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum. o Enable proper function of toll-like receptors and the innate immune system. o Carry irreparable proteins to intracellular garbage disposals to be degraded into peptides (short chains of amino acids – protein fragments). · Loading peptides onto another class of proteins known as MHC I molecules. MHC I molecules move to the cellular surface where they are monitored by the immune system. Heat shock protein gp96 is one of the most abundantly expressed proteins in the human body and is expressed by all cells. It is normally retained within cells in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it facilitates the folding of newly synthesized proteins so that they may perform their various tasks properly. Gp96 is particularly important in the process of detecting antigens as it is present in all cell types, it is able to recognize all antigens. It also induces the immune system to activate CD8+ (killer) T cells which then seek out and destroy the cells that are marked by antigens. Gp96 is normally only contained inside the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, however when a cell dies an abnormal death through necrosis it breaks open and releases gp96 into the surrounding tissue microenvironment. ImPACT works by modifying the chemical structure of gp96 so that a cell can continuously release it into the extracellular space accompanied by the unique peptide that it is folding at the time without causing necrosis. This allows the immune system to seek out and destroy cells characterized with antigens before the body would otherwise have detected them. ImPACT Technology Overview The problem with utilizing gp96 as a cancer immunotherapy is that it is normally retained within cells by a small region called a KDEL sequence that acts like a leash, preventing gp96 from leaving the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, in order to utilize gp96 as a therapeutic gp96 would either have to be purified from individual cells or engineered to be secreted from cells. To overcome this problem, a team of scientists led by Eckhard, Podack, MD, Ph.D., the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board and the inventor of our technology, deleted this KDEL sequence and replaced it with another sequence that causes the new fusion protein, called gp96-Ig, to be released from cells continuously. Multiple tumor cell lines were then made to express gp96-Ig, and as expected, secreted it continuously into the extracellular space in a complex with tumor proteins. Dr. Podack demonstrated that gp96-Ig vaccination effectively cross-presented tumor specific antigens to immune cells, led to expansion of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and the subsequent rejection 51 of injected tumor cells. Importantly, these studies demonstrated that the secreted protein gp96-Ig maintained the critical characteristics of the native gp96 protein required to generate anti-tumor immune responses. Thus, proof-of-principle was established that the innovation, gp96-Ig, not only retained the desired properties of the native gp96 protein, but enhanced those functions and led to tumor-killing immune responses. Our ImPACT technology platform: · Effectively cross-presents tumor antigens and leads to cytotoxic killer T cell activation Published studies in mice showed that killer T cell activation was approximately 10 million times greater with ImPACT secreted gp96-Ig than with a corresponding gp96 protein injection. The modified cell secretes gp96 in a sustained release for several days after injection. This creates a sustained immune response. Additionally, the immune response kills tumor cells, releasing additional gp96 and creating a continuous response loop that supports persistent activation of killer T cells. This data suggests that gp96-chaperoned peptides may represent the most efficient, robust pathway for presenting a cell ’ s antigens to the immune system and activating killer T cell. · Binds and presents all potential tumor antigens to the immune system simultaneously A single type of tumor (or virus) might have multiple strains derived from numerous tumor cells. These different strains have different antigens, all of which are capable of initiating an immune response. By creating a vaccine from a native tumor-cell line, we believe that ImPACTs technology can develop a therapy that shares many common features with patients tumors of the same origin. We believe this blanket approach will provide each patient with a higher likelihood of a positive response to the therapy. · Features killer T cell Activation that is independent of CD4+ T cell help Animal studies have confirmed that our technology initiates a mechanism called cross-presentation that is critical to inducing tumor rejection. Importantly, it does this independently and successfully without additional CD4+ T cell recruitment, which is typically required in a normal immune system response. This is particularly important in cancer and HIV because helper T cell activity is frequently impaired in these disease states. · Causes few side effects We believe our technology allows the body to recognize cancer as a foreign entity and uses the body ’ s natural immune mechanism to fight it. In doing so, we believe Heat ’ s therapy will generate fewer side effects and that patients will be able to maintain a higher quality of life. The distinguishing characteristics of ImPACT are: (i) While most other immunotherapy approaches target only a single antigen, Heats patented approach uses modified heat shock proteins to stimulate an immune response against multiple antigens contained within cancer cells. Cancer cells express different antigens that can be used to initiate an immune response. Each ImPACT vaccine is created from a native tumor-cell line that we believe expresses the widest array of antigens common to a particular type of cancer. We believe this pan-antigen approach provides each patient with a higher likelihood of a response to the therapy. (ii) Heats vaccines are off-the-shelf (allogeneic) and may therefore be less expensive to manufacture than patient-specific (autologous) vaccines . Heats vaccines are mass-produced from a single source while other immunotherapy approaches require physicians to extract a patients blood and/or cells, send them to a lab where a personalized vaccine is created, and then have them shipped back to the physician for injection into the patient. (iii) While there are competing companies that are developing therapies that are both off-the-shelf and which target multiple antigens, Heats ImPACT technology is the only known off-the-shelf (allogeneic) vaccine to us that directly induces cross-presentation to the CD8+ (killer) T cells, which are the cytotoxic arm of the immune system. Stimulating these CD8 (killer) T cells through cross-presentation has recently been shown to be critical to the induction of effective anti-tumor immunity. We believe Heat is able to leverage gp96 to serve as its own powerful immune stimulant (adjuvant) while other companies technologies rely on the use of a secondary adjuvant like GMCSF or Alum. 52 Our Product Candidates and Clinical Development Programs We have initiated a clinical development program to target our ImPACT technology platform against a range of diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. We have filed to initiate a Phase II clinical trial with our first therapeutic vaccine, HS-110, against NSCLC in 2013, and we are planning to initiate a Phase I/ II clinical trial for bladder cancer in mid-2013. We plan to initiate Phase I trials for breast and ovarian cancer in 2014, pursuant to receiving additional non-dilutive grants and/or other financings. Our lead scientist has also completed advanced study in primates for the development of a therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine for the treatment and prevention of HIV. This study continues to be fully funded by the NIH. The HIV trials were initiated by the primary inventor and to date have been funded by grants awarded to the primary inventor, which can be used in the discretion of the inventor. We have no funding obligation for such trials and the primary inventor is responsible for future development and research. Summary of HS-110 Clinical Trials Phase I HS-110 Clinical Trials Background A Phase I clinical trial with HS-110 in patients with very late stage IIIB/IV NSCLC was completed at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center with a total of 18 patients dosed, 15 of which completed the first course of three planned courses of therapy and were evaluated. The primary purpose of this trial was to demonstrate safety of HS-110, while the secondary endpoints were the induction of gp96-Ig specific immune responses and the overall survival rate. The patients were divided into 3 arms. Due to statistical and safety considerations, the patients in the trial were not evenly divided among the three arms. Arm 1, which consisted of 11 patients, received 40 million cells every two weeks for 18 weeks, arm 2, which consisted of 4 patients, received 20 million cells every week for 18 weeks and arm 3, which consisted of 3 patients, received 10 million cells twice a week for 18 weeks. Three of the patients, who were late stage lung cancer patients, died before we could evaluate their immune response and were not included in the valuation set at the end of the trial. Our Phase I trial was conducted as an investigator-sponsored IND and was fully funded by the NIH. The criteria for inclusion was: (i) patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent disease; (ii) at least one site of bi-dimensionally measurable disease; (iii) treated brain metastasis must be stable by CT scan or MRI for at least 8 weeks; (iv) patient must have received and failed at least two lines of therapy (one of them erlotinib); (v) age ≥ 18 years; ECOG performance status 0-2; life expectancy ≥ 3 months; and (vi) signed informed consent. The median age was 67 years (range 38-86). None of the reported serious adverse events were considered by the trial investigator to be treatment-related. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2 involving transitory erythema and skin induration. Seven of 18 (39%) patients achieved disease stabilization for a clinical benefit of 39%. Median survival was 8.1 months. In 11 of 15 patients (73%) there was a twofold or greater increase CD8 cells secreting interferon gamma (CD8-CTL IFN- γ ) following vaccination, and these patients showed a median survival of 16.5 months. There were no serious adverse events (SAE) or immune related events (IRE) with the vaccine or the vaccinations. Most of the adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2 and involved erythema and skin induration that were transitory and usually resolved in 1-2 weeks. We believe our preliminary Phase I results indicate that HS-110 may increase median survival for responding patients as compared to historical controls. For this analysis, the overall survival of the patients on the trial is compared to published historical controls. The historical control used for this analysis was determined using a meta-analysis of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with an equivalent performance status (0-1) of the patients on the current trial who had failed 4 prior lines of therapy. The patients enrolled in our trial had failed an average of 7 prior lines of therapy. Although preliminary in nature, the data indicates that the patients treated with the HS-110 vaccine may have an increase in survival over historical controls both in terms of median survival and overall survival. It is also important to note that, based upon IND requirements and the randomization protocol then in place, 11 of the 18 patients enrolled in the trial at the time of the interim analysis were on arm 1, the least frequent dosing arm which was administered once every two weeks, which is expected to be the least effective based on preclinical studies. 53 Other patients were enrolled in arms 2 and 3, where we would anticipate improved responses in patients due to the more frequent dosing schedule. To date, several patients disease have stabilized, including some patients with very large primary lesions in the lung as well as multiple distant metastatic sites, including the liver and lymph nodes. HS-110 Generally Well Tolerated We believe HS-110 was generally well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered by the trial investigator to be treatment-related. Most of the adverse events (AEs) were reported as mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) with the most frequent being skin induration and rash that were transitory and usually resolved in 1 to 2 weeks. There were no immune-related events with the vaccine or the vaccinations. Based upon these Phase I results, we believe HS-110 appears to be generally well tolerated and capable of generating CD8-CTL IFN- γ immune responses in patients with advanced NSCLC. Skin reactions at the vaccination site were minimal and of short duration and there was no evidence of the generation of any autoimmune phenomena. In lieu of a dose escalation design, the design of the Phase I trial involved increasing the frequency of vaccination, while still retaining the total dose of vaccine cells administered. A more frequent vaccination schedule caused increased tumor rejection in preclinical models and also anecdotally appeared to be of benefit in this study. Positive Immunological Response In 11 of the 15 patients completing the first course of therapy (73%) with HS 110, there was a twofold or greater increase CD8 cells secreting interferon gamma (CD8-CTL IFN- γ ) following vaccination, and these patients showed a median survival of 16.5 months. Since NSCLC is known to be highly immunosuppressive, we believe that by overcoming tumor-induced-suppression with frequent vaccinations as observed anecdotally in the Phase I study and the generation of an observed potent polyepitope specific CD8 CTL is encouraging and warrants further study. Clinical Benefit We believe HS-110 appears to provide clinical benefit to the 11 patients that responded to the therapy. Clinical benefit is defined as evidence of improved symptomology, disease control, progression-free survival or overall survival as compared to matched historical controls (i.e. patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed on 2 or more prior therapies). Seven of 15 patients completing the first course of therapy (39%; 95% CI: 17.3- 64.3%) achieved disease stabilization after the first course of vaccinations (6 weeks) and 8 patients had disease progression. The Kaplan Meier estimate of median time to progression was 1.4 months (95% CI: 1.3-2.7), and the PFS rates at 1, 2 and 3 months were 88.9% (95% CI: 62.4- 97.1%), 38.9% (95% CI: 17.5-60.0%), and 11.1% (95% CI: 1.9-29.8%), respectively. Of note, two patients remained progression free for just over 7 months. The typical median survival period for late-stage lung cancer is 4.5 months for patients who are not receiving any treatment. As of March 2013, 2 of the 15 patients who completed the first course of therapy remain alive and have been followed for over 3 years and 4 years, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median survival was 8.1 months (95% CI: 6.7- 18.2), and the 1, 2, and 3-year OS rates were 44.4% (95% CI: 21.6-65.1%), 19.0% (95% CI: 4.8- 40.3%), and 9.5% (95% CI: 0.8-32.1%), respectively. In summary, based on the results of this Phase 1 trial in 18 patients, in which 15 patients remained at the end of the trial and were evaluated, we believe HS-110 appears to be generally well tolerated and capable of generating CD8-CTL IFN- γ immune responses in patients with advanced NSCLC. We believe that clinical benefit, based on stabilization of disease and overall survival, was observed with the overall rate of survival above the historically expected rate for these heavily pretreated patients with very poor prognoses. 54 Adverse Events by Body System Body System Number of Events (N=219) Severity Grade (# of events) Inspection Site Reactions 166 (75.8%) Grade 1 (166) Respiratory System 9 (4.1%) Grade 2(5) Body As a Whole (general disorders including fever) 8(3.7%) Grade 1(4) Grade 2(3) a Grade 3(1) b Nervous System 8(3.7%) Grade 2(1) Musculoskeletal 7(3.2%) Grade 2(5) Digestive System 7(3.2%) Grade 1(7) Metabolic and Nutrition 6(2.7%) Grade 1(6) Skin and Appendages (non-injection site reactions) 4(1.8%) Grade 2(1) Cardiovacsular System 2(0.9%) Grade 2(1) Urogenital System 1(0.5%) Grade 1(1) Endocrine System 1(0.5%) Grade 2(1) Hemic and Lymphatic    a All grade 2 AEs except 4 were classified as non-related to treatment.

According to the National Cancer Institute, in 2013, lung cancer is expected to account for 26% of all female cancer deaths and 29% of all male cancer deaths. An expected 228,190 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer in the United States in 2012. Of these lung cancers, roughly 85-90% will present as non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with advanced clinical stage IIIB/IV disease visible on chest radiography have a 5-year survival rate as low as 1-5%. Clinical Development Our technology was the subject of an investigator initiated Phase I clinical trial conducted at the Sylvester Cancer Center for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC or lung cancer) to establish safety and proof of concept clinical efficacy. After completion of the 18 patient Phase I trial, in which 15 patients completed the first course of three planned course of therapy and were evaluated, we successfully opened a new IND to conduct additional trials with HS-110 in patients with NSCLC. Our Phase II study has been designed as a maintenance therapy study in patients with Stage III/IV NSCLC who have completed a 1 st line regimen consisting of a platinum doublet, crizotinib or erlotinib and achieved at least stable disease. The trial is structured as a multicenter randomized, active controlled add-on dosing study to evaluate the immune response, safety and efficacy endpoints of HS-110 when administered weekly for 18 weeks in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We anticipate opening approximately 15-20 clinical sites and enrolling approximately 125 patients with an expected enrollment period of 2.5 years. The trial is a 3-stage, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. In stage 1 (dose-finding), patients will be randomized to either placebo treatment, low dose HS-110 (2 x 10 6 cells) or high dose HS-110 (1 x 10 7 cells), administered weekly for 18 doses (18 weeks). In stage 2 (proof of concept), patients will be randomized to either placebo treatment or HS-110 at the dose determined to produce the optimal immune response in Stage 1. In Stage 3 (biocomparability), patients will be randomized to one of two dose preparations of HS-110 administered weekly for 18 weeks at the dose determined to produce the optimal immune response in Stage 1. The primary endpoint in Stages 1 and 3 will be immune response; the primary endpoint in Stage 2 will be progression-free survival. All stages will examine additional secondary endpoints including overall survival. In addition to our Phase II study, our chief scientist has received a grant award from the Marcus Foundation that fully funds a 36 patient Phase I investigator-sponsored Phase I study for use of HS-110 as a combination therapy with theophylline and oxygen. We expect to begin this study in Q2-2013. Bladder Cancer Disease In the United States, bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the ninth most common cancer in women. According to the National Institutes of Cancer, 1 in 42 men and women will be diagnosed with bladder cancer during their lifetime, a total of more than half a million patients in the US. There are more than 60,000 cases of bladder cancer diagnosed each year in the United States, resulting in over 14,000 deaths per year. Available treatments are currently not effective, thus this remains an area of high unmet need. 57 Clinical Development The Bladder Cancer Phase I/II Trial cGMP-grade cell lines are currently being developed that will be used to treat patients with advanced bladder cancer. It is anticipated that these cellular vaccines will be completed by the 2nd quarter of 2013, with a Phase I/II clinical trial beginning shortly thereafter. In parallel with our clinical development plans, we have engaged a vendor as our clinical grade contract manufacturer for our future potential Phase III trial. Preparation of IND documents in support of HS-410 for bladder cancer are in progress. We anticipate IND activation in 2013. This IND will include a 93 patient, Phase I/II trial to examine safety, tolerability, immune response and preliminary clinical activity of HS-410 in patients with high risk, superficial bladder cancer who have completed surgical resection and 6 weekly intravesical bacillus Calmet-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy installations. We anticipate including approximately 8-10 clinical sites with an enrollment period of 12-18 months. The Phase I portion will randomize 18 patients in 1:1 fashion to either a high or low dose group. Patients will receive weekly intradermal injections of HS-410 for 18 weeks and immune response will be evaluated at baseline, week 6, week 12 and week 18. The first 4 patients in each dose group will be enrolled at 2 week intervals to allow opportunity to assess safety and tolerability of HS-410. At the completion of the Phase I program, the dose resulting in the optimal immune response will be advanced to Phase II. In the phase II portion, 75 patients will be enrolled in 2:1 fashion to HS-410 or placebo. Primary endpoint will examine time to 1 st recurrence of bladder cancer. Other endpoints will include recurrence rate, progression rate and immune response. Triple Negative Breast Cancer According to the American Cancer Society, there will be 232,340 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in 2013. Approximately 10-20% of those cases will be triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive form of the disease marked by earlier age of onset, worse clinical outcome, and a higher rate of local relapse. This disease cannot be treated by hormone therapy or receptor-directed monoclonal antibodies. New approaches for treatment to prevent relapse in this disease after early treatment need to be investigated. Clinical Development The TNBC Phase I Trial cGMP grade cell lines are currently being developed that will be used to treat patients with TNBC. It is anticipated that these cell lines will be completed by the 2nd quarter of 2013, with a Phase I clinical trial in early 2014. Ovarian Cancer Disease Ovarian cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers among women and ranks the second among gynecologic cancers. According to the American Cancer Institute, an estimated 22,240 new cases are expected in the US in 2013. Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system, and will lead to an estimated 14,230 deaths in the United States in 2013. 16 Due to the prevalence of ovarian cancer and its poor prognosis, particularly when discovered late, the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of ovarian cancer is a high priority. Clinical Development To address this problem, cGMP-grade cellular vaccines are being developed that will be used to treat patients with advanced serous ovarian carcinoma. It is anticipated that these cell lines will be completed by early 2013, with a Phase I clinical trial pending the availability of adequate funding. 58 Other Cancers Our ImPACT -technology is a broad based approach and can be used to combat a variety of cancers. We are in the process of identifying available cell lines, such as pancreatic cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma, and vesicular lymphoma. We expect to have several additional ImPACT -based products in the clinic in 2013. Infectious Diseases To date, over $4,000,000 in governmental and institutional funding has been provided to the inventor of the technology we license for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) research using our ImPACT -technology. We do not intend to use any of the proceeds of this offering to further any HIV or HCV research and instead plan to conduct additional research with respect to the use of our ImPACT -technology for the treatment of such diseases solely through additional governmental and institutional grants, if any, that may be received. Manufacturing We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and store our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. The HS-110 used in our Phase I and Phase II clinical trials was and is currently manufactured by our cGMP contractors under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). We have retained a vendor, who has begun production of HS-110 to be used in our potential Phase III clinical trials. We entered into an eight year Manufacturing Services Agreement, dated October 19, 2011, with the vendor (the Manufacturing Agreement). The Manufacturing Agreement provides that the vendor will manufacture products based on our ImPACT technology intended for use in pharmaceutical or medicinal end products, including, without limitation, products in a final packaged form and labeled for use in clinical trials or for commercial sales to end users in accordance with the terms and conditions of individual statements of work. The Manufacturing Agreement requires that we purchase certain minimum amounts each year from the vendor. The Manufacturing Agreement may be terminated by the parties upon mutual agreement, and by each party for a material breach by the other party that is not cured within the cure period, upon notice that a clinical trial for which product is being produced under the agreement is suspended or terminated or upon the other partys insolvency, dissolution or liquidation. The HS-110 used in our clinical trials was and is currently manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). The vaccine is grown in large quantities and quality tested according to FDA guidelines. Following testing, the vaccine is irradiated, which is a commonly used attenuation process that eliminates the ability of the gp96-Ig-containing vaccine cell lines from replicating, but allows it to continue secreting gp96-Ig for a period of several days. Quality tested, irradiated batches of the vaccine are then dispensed into individual doses and frozen in liquid nitrogen. These batches of frozen vaccines are stable for long periods of time, and are thawed immediately prior to administration to patients. Sufficient material to complete the phase I/II study has already been produced, and preparations are underway to produce quantities required for subsequent clinical trials. Competition The pharmaceutical industry and biologics industry are each highly competitive and characterized by a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies and other companies, as well as smaller companies like ours. If our competitors market products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than any future products developed from our product candidates, or that reach the market before our approved product candidates, we may not achieve commercial success. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities. As a biotech company with a cancer immunotherapy as its lead therapeutic, we compete with a broad range of companies. At the highest level, cancer immunotherapy can be seen as both a complement and a potential competitor to any oncology therapy, most notably chemotherapy, biologics and small molecule drugs. Not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiology and chemotherapy but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop an immunology vaccine for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have more established reputations as well as global distribution 59 channels that may be more effective than ours. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly (Alimta), Bristol-Myers Squibb (Erbitux) and Sanofi-Aventis (Eloxatin), and more established biotechnology companies such as Roche/Genentech (Avastin and Tarceva), and competing cancer autologous immunotherapy companies such as Dendreon and others which have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are cheaper, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches. We expect to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our competitors may: · develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective or safer than our future products; · commercialize competing products before we can launch any products developed from our product candidates; · operate larger research and development programs, possess greater manufacturing capabilities or have substantially greater financial resources than we do; · initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can; · have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent; · amore effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and · take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can. We expect to compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many major pharmaceutical companies have at least one immunotherapy drug or therapeutic in development, either directly or in partnership with a smaller biotech firm. Some of our competitors that are developing competitive immunology drugs and therapeutics include Merck kGaA/Oncothyreons Stimuvax for the treatment of breast cancer and NSCLC; Transgene and its product TG4010 for the treatment of NSCLC lung cancer; GlaxoSmithKline and its product MAGE-A3 for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, multiple myeloma and squamous cell carcinoma; Oxford BioMedica and its product TroVax for the treatment of prostate, kidney and colorectal cancer); NewLink Genetics and its treatment for pancreatic cancer and lung cancer; Celldex/Pfizer and their product CDX-110 for the treatment of malignant brain cancer; and Dendreon and its product Provenge for the treatment of prostate cancer. The primary treatments for non-small cell lung cancer are surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and various combinations of each of these treatments. A large number of patients, particularly with advanced disease, are refractory to these treatments and are subsequently treated with a number of emerging biologic agents, including immunotherapy. Some examples of therapies commonly attempted with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients include: Alimta (pemetrexed), Avastin (bevacizumab), Tarceva (EGF inhibitor), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Erbitux (cetuximab), Carboplatin, Taxol, VP16 and Arlibercept. It is unlikely that biologic agents will compete with more traditional therapies in the short-term, but many oncologists believe that such therapies will eventually become the mainstay of lung cancer therapy. None of these agents have proven particularly effective for stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients, with the most effective therapies only increasing survival by a few months. As a result, we do not consider these agents to be direct competitors to HS-110 because they are likely to be given either in sequence or in conjunction with some of the agents listed. Furthermore, many patients cannot tolerate many of the chemotherapeutics listed. Thus, we believe if HS-110 has a positive safety profile (without observation of local or systemic toxicities, none of which have been seen to date), it is likely that HS-110 would be preferred both by physicians and patients in this stage of disease. 60 As previously stated we compete with other forms of cancer treatment such as biologic therapies in addition to immunology therapies. There are several biologic therapies in clinical development against NSCLC that have been identified as potential competitors to HS-110. In particular, a cell-based vaccine therapy, Lucanix, is in development by NovaRx. Lucanix has entered phase III clinical trials. Our strategy is to emphasize what we believe to be our competitive advantages which are that our therapy will have less side effects than most other chemotherapies, will be available at lower prices than other therapies and will work on almost all types of cancer and not just one specific type. Although all chemotherapy drugs have severe side-effects such as overall damage to the immune system, not only to cancerous cells, leading to hair loss, nausea and vomiting, and considerable pain, etc., the side effects from immunotherapy are typically reduced because immunotherapy works with the bodys own immune response. According to Schreiber et al, patient-specific vaccines are not more effective than off-the shelf vaccines in reducing tumors. Furthermore, patient-specific vaccines cost far more to produce than off the shelf (allogeneic) vaccines, where any donor tissue can be used. Over 95% of newly developed cancer immunotherapies cost over $20,000 per course of treatment. Grant Funding To date, in excess of $14,000,000 in grants, have been awarded to the primary inventor of the technology we license to fund development of ImPACT technology and clinical trials upon which our clinical programs are based. We have little control over the direction of the NIH grant funds that have been received by the primary inventor of the technology we license and since payment is made to the inventors as opposed to us we do not recognize any revenue from such grant funds nor do they fund any expenses that we incur. Although earmarked for further development of the technology that we license, any funds awarded to the primary inventor are used in his discretion and we have little control over his use of the funds. Previous Grant awards for development of ImPACT Grant Title Granting Organization Amount Regulation of Anti-Tumor Immunity NIH $4,922,000 Molecular Mechanism of Anti-Tumor and Anti-Bacterial Cytotoxicity NIH $2,532,000 Mechanisms of mucosal protection by HPV-SIV and gp96-Ig-SIV vaccines NIH $2,000,000 Systemic and mucosal HIV-immunity by HSP-gp96 vaccines NIH $451,000 Induction of mucosal SIV immunity in non-human primates by secreted HSP-gp96 NIH $2,125,000 Clinical Translation of Gene Therapy for Lung Cancer Award Recipient Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy $1,000,000 Clinical Translation of Gene Therapy for Lung Cancer Award Recipient State of Florida $100,000 QTDP Grant Dept. of Treasury $244,000 Use of HS-110 as a Combination Therapy with Theophylline and Oxygen in Advanced Lung Cancer Patients Marcus Foundation $840,000 Intellectual Property License Agreements and Intellectual Property Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets and rights in our unique biological materials, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our 61 policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the strongest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates ( ImPACT therapy) and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business  We have limited protection of our intellectual property. We will continue to depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. License Agreements In July 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Miami (the University) for intellectual and tangible property rights relating to ImPACT , technology. This license agreement was subsequently assigned to our subsidiary Heat Biologics I, Inc. which issued to the University shares of its common stock representing seven and one half percent (7.5%) of its common stock, of which 5% was non-dilutable until our receipt of the proceeds of our recent Series B-1 Preferred Stock private placement in March 2013. The term of the license is the length of the last to expire patent, unless terminated earlier. The license agreement grants Heat Biologics I, Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the following patent-related rights: · U.S. patent applications: Serial number 60/075.358 (the “ ‘ 358 application ” ) entitled “ Modified Heat Shock Protein-Antigenic Peptide Complex ” and filed on February 20, 1998; Serial number 09/253,439 (the  439 application) entitled Modified Heat Shock Protein-Antigenic Peptide Complex  and filed on February 19, 1999; serial number 11/878,460 (the  460 application) entitled Recombinant Cancer Cell Secreting Modified Heat Shock Protein-Antigenic Peptide Complex and filed on July 24, 2007; and all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these U.S. applications; as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts (to the extent they are sufficiently described in the 358, 439, or 460 applications) of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing (the GP96 Vaccine Technology Portfolio) As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, the licensee is obligated to pay the University upfront license fees, additional yearly and milestone payments and a royalty based on net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. More specifically, the licensee is obligated to pay the University (i) all past and future patent costs associated with the licensed patent-related rights; (ii) a license issue fee of $150,000; (iii) annual payments of $10,000 in 2010, 2011 and 2012, and $20,000 each year thereafter; (iv) a milestone payment of $250,000 by the earlier of May 31, 2017 or approval of a BLA for the lung cancer vaccine or for a cancer vaccine other than lung cancer; and (v) royalties equal to a percent (ranging from low to mid single digits ) of net sales of licensed products. The royalty rate is subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to the University equal to a percentage of what it would have been required to pay to the University had it sold the products under sublicense itself. In exchange for additional consideration, the University has agreed to postpone the payment due dates of this license agreement. To date, a total of $360,113 has been paid to the University with respect to such license agreement. The license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate the license if we have not introduced, or at least used our best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the US, EU, or Japan by December 31, 2020; and otherwise exercise diligence to bring licensed products to market or in the event of our insolvency or bankruptcy. In addition, either party has a right to terminate the license agreement upon a material breach of an obligation under the license agreement by the other party if such breach is not cured and we have the right to terminate upon 90 days notice. In the event of a termination, we are obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. In the event 62 that we breach a material term of one or both of the license agreements, the University has the option to terminate the agreement following the giving of notice and an opportunity to cure any such breach. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia. In February 2011, our subsidiary, Heat Biologics I, Inc., entered into four additional exclusive license agreements with the University. The terms of each of these additional licenses runs until all the patent-related rights licensed therein have expired, unless terminated earlier. In each of these additional exclusive license agreements, Heat Biologics I, Inc. obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell products covered under the following patent-related rights: · U.S. patent application serial number 61/347,336 entitled Cancer Treatment and filed on May 21, 2010, all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these U.S. applications; as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts (to the extent they are sufficiently described in the applications) of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing (the Cancer Treatment Portfolio). · U.S. patent application serial number 61/033,425 entitled “ Allogeneic Cancer – Based Immunotherapy ” and filed on March 3, 2008 and PCT application number PCT/2009/001330 “ Allogeneic Cancer – Based Immunotherapy ” filed on March 3, 2009, all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these U.S. applications as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts (to the extent they are sufficiently described in the applications) of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing (the Allogeneic Cancer Based Immunotherapy Portfolio). · U.S. patent application serial number 61/033,425 entitled “ Heat Shock Protein GP96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same ” filed on March 20, 2008 and PCT application number PCT/ 2009/001727 “ Heat Shock Protein GP96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same “ filed on March 19, 2009, all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these U.S. applications as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts (to the extent they are sufficiently described in the applications) of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing (the Heat Shock Protein GP96 Vaccination Portfolio). · U.S. patent application serial number 61/116.971 entitled “ HIV/SIV Vaccine for the Generation of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity ” filed November 28, 2008 and PCT application number PCT/ 2009/065500 ” “ HIV/SIV Vaccine for the Generation of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity filed on November 23, 2009 all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these U.S. applications as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts (to the extent they are sufficiently described in the applications) of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing (the HIV/SIV Vaccine Portfolio). As consideration for the rights granted in these additional four license agreements, the licensee is obligated to pay the University certain upfront license fees, past and future patent costs and royalties based on net sales on commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. No annual or milestone payments are required under any of these four additional license agreements. The upfront license fees for the Cancer Treatment Portfolio and the HIV/SIV Vaccine Portfolio license agreements are $10,000 and $50,000, respectively. No upfront license fees were required under the license agreements for the Allogeneic CancerBased Immunotherapy and the Heat Shock Protein GP96 portfolios. Under each of these four additional license agreements, the royalties are equal to a percent (ranging from low to mid single digits) of net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights in the respective license agreements. These royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to the University equal to a percentage of what it would have been required to pay to the University had it sold the products under sublicense itself. Each of these additional license agreements also provide that the licensee will not have to pay more than above royalty rates and sublicense fees if more than one license from the University is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights. In exchange for additional consideration (including the requirement that Heat Biologics I, Inc. pay additional milestone payments of 63 $25,000 before initiation of any phase III clinical trials for products covered by any of the license agreements, and an additional payment equal to 18% annual interest on the amounts due or a note convertible into an equivalent value of shares in Heats Preferred Stock), the University agreed to postpone the payment due dates for each of these four additional licenses. On April 26, 2013, the outstanding balances to the University under the license agreements were paid in full. All five of the above-described license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee has (i) not introduced, or at least use it best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the US, EU, or Japan by December 31, 2020; (ii) not otherwise exercise diligence to bring licensed products to market; or (iii) files, or has filed against it, a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, is adjudged insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has an unreleased or unsatisfied writ of attachment or execution levied upon it. In addition, upon an uncured material breach of an obligation under any one of these license agreements by a party, the other party has the right to terminate that agreement upon 90 days notice or 30 days notice if the breach relates to payments due to the University. In the event of a termination, Heat Biologics I, Inc. will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. Each of the license agreements also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensees agreement to indemnify the University for liabilities arising out of the negligence of licensee, making the license grant subject to the Bayh-Dole act (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.), the reservation of licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties and representations, reporting and record-keeping requirements, and licensee liability insurance requirements. In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with the University under which the University granted us an option to obtain an exclusive license to the following patent-related rights: · U.S. patent application serial number 12/303,036 entitled “ Perforin-2 Proteins ” filed December 2, 2008 and U.S. patent application serial number 61/637.455 entitled “ Perforin-2 Defense Against Invasive and Multi-drug Resistant Bacteria ” filed Modified Heat Shock Protein-Antigenic Peptide Complex  and filed on April 21, 2012; all U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications based on these U.S. applications; as well as all divisionals, continuations, and those claims in continuations-in-parts (to the extent they are sufficiently described in the aforementioned applications) of the foregoing, and any re-examinations or reissues of the foregoing. In consideration for the option, we are obligated to pay the University an option fee of $2,000 and to reimburse the University $3,000 for past patent costs. The term of the option is twelve months and is extendible so long as we continue to pay ongoing patent expenses. In addition to the licenses obtained from the University, we have entered into agreements with (i) the Regents of the University of Michigan (U.Mich); and (ii) the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for the evaluation of, acquisition of commercial rights to, certain biological materials. In July 2011, we exercised an option agreement with U.Mich and entered into an exclusive license agreement with U.Mich to use, market, offer for sale, sell and/or sublicense materials and processes related to certain bladder cancer cell lines. The term of the license is perpetual, unless terminated earlier by us or by U.Mich. As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, we agreed to pay U.Mich up-front license fees and additional yearly and milestone payments. We also assumed under the license agreement responsibility for any infringement of third party rights caused by our use of the licensed materials. We paid an option fee of $2,000, a license issue fee of $10,000 and are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $10,000 each year until the first commercial sale of a licensed product at which time the annual maintenance fee increases to $50,000. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments of $25,000, $50,000 and $75,000 upon completion of a Phase I, Phase II and Phase III trial and $250,000 upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product and $350,000 upon annual net sales of $250,000,000 or more. To date, we have paid $22,000 to U.Mich. with respect to such license. The license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate the license should we cease to carry on our business, fail to make a required payment or otherwise materially breach or default in our obligations under the license agreement following the giving of notice and an opportunity to cure any such breach. The license agreement provides that if we do not achieve the following milestones within the required period, U.Mich has the right to terminate the license 64 agreement: completion of a Phase I clinical trial on or before January 1, 2015, a Phase II clinical trial on or before January 1, 2017, a Phase III clinical trial on or before January 1, 2019 and the first commercial sale of a product that includes the materials supplied by U.Mich on or before January 1, 2020. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia. In April 2011 we entered into an evaluation and biological material license agreement with the ATCC to evaluate, use, market, offer for sale, sell and/or sublicense materials and processes related to various different cell lines. The agreement with ATCC provides for an evaluation term of twelve months subject to two additional twelve-month renewals and a non-exclusive commercial use license upon termination of the evaluation period to utilize the products we obtain in the evaluation to develop, make, use and sell licensed products. The agreement with ATCC has a term of forty years. We paid an evaluation fee of $5,000, two $5,000 evaluation fees, and are obligated to pay a license issue fee of $50,000 and a percent of net sales (low single digits) based on sales of licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments of $15,000, $30,000 and $60,000 upon initiation of a Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III trial, respectively; and $200,000 upon receipt of marketing authorization. To date, we have paid $15,000 to the ATCC with respect to such license. Under the license agreements with the University, we have obtained exclusive rights to five different patent families directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to our vaccine platform and preclinical development program for cancer. These families comprise five PCT applications, seven granted patents, sixteen patent validations in European countries, one allowed patent application and thirty seven other pending patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe and Japan as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets. For each platform or program, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including one or more of the following: our available resources, the size of the commercial market, the presence of a potential competitor or a contract manufacturer in the market and whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights. The patent families associated with our ImPACT platform are: Recombinant cancer cell secreting modified heat shock protein-antigenic peptide complex. This family of patent filings relates to methods and compositions for enhancing an immune response. More particularly, the application describes the creation of a tumor cell therapy including a cancer cell that has been engineered to secrete a heat shock protein (gp96), and the use of such therapy to enhance an anti-tumor immune response. Within this family are one pending US application, one granted Australian patent, one pending Canadian application, one pending European application, two granted European patents (collectively validated in 16 countries), one pending Japanese application, and one granted Japanese patent. Not including any patent term adjustments or extensions (e.g., for patent office delays or extensions/exclusivity periods provided for new drug approvals in the US and some foreign countries), the term for patents in this family extends until 2019. Heat Shock Protein gp96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same This family of patent filings also relates to methods and compositions for enhancing an immune response. It further describes: (a) how intraperitoneal gp96-Ig administration increases recruitment of innate immune cells into the administration site, mediates proliferation of dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8 cells, and activates natural killer (NK) cells; (b) that gp96-Ig-secreting cell vaccines are more effective when gp96-Ig is continuously released; (c) that frequent gp96 immunizations can overcome tumor-induced immune suppression and retards tumor growth; and (d) that B cell depletion can enhance gp96-Ig -mediated recruitment of NK cells and retention of DCs in the administration site. Within this family are one granted Australian patent, and one pending application each in the U.S., Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Not including any patent term adjustments or extensions, the term for patents in this family extends until 2029. Allogenic Cancer Cell Based Immunotherapy This family of patent filings also relates to methods and compositions for enhancing an immune response. It further describes: (a) making vaccines cells allogeneic by expressing exogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens; (b) B cell depletion to augment the effectiveness of the vaccines; and (c) the enhancement of anti-tumor immune responses using multiple immunizations less than two weeks apart. Within this family are one granted 65 Australian patent, one allowed U.S. application, and one pending application each in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, and South Korea. Not including any patent term adjustments or extensions, the term for patents in this family extends until 2029. Cancer Treatment This family of patent filings contains results from a phase I clinical trial of human subjects with cancer. Within this family are one pending application each in the U.S., Australia, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, and South Korea. Filings in Canada and Hong Kong are intended to be made before the respective deadlines. Not including any patent term adjustments or extensions, the term for patents in this family extends until 2031. HIV/SIV Vaccines to Generate Mucosal and Systemic Immunity Within this family are one allowed South African application, and one pending application each in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Not including any patent term adjustments or extensions, the term for patents in this family extends until 2029. This patent family relates to the use of host cells that have been engineered to secrete a heat shock protein (gp96) to treat various chronic viral infections including those caused by HIV. Government Regulation In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (FDCA), and its implementing regulations. Neither HS-110, HS-310, HS-410 or HS-510 nor our future therapeutics, if any, may be marketed in the United States until they received FDA approval. The steps required before a therapeutic, including may be marketed in the United States include: · preclinical laboratory tests, animal pharmacology and toxicology studies, and formulation studies; · submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials might begin; · adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic for each indication; · submission to the FDA of a BLA; · FDA review and approval of the BLA; and · satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the therapeutic is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices(GMPs). Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials might begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Our Phase I clinical trials for HS-110 began on July 2007 and we have an open IND to begin a Phase II clinical trial. We were formed in 2008. We cannot be sure that submission of any future IND for another therapeutic study will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or therapeutic to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases might overlap. The study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an 66 institutional review board for each institution where the trials will be conducted. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug or therapeutic into humans to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Our Phase I study for HS-110 was designed to determine the safety of HS-110 for use in human patients and secondary endpoints included immune response and increased survival. We met our primary endpoint and are in the process of initiating a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: · evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; · identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and · evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug or therapeutic for specific indications. Phase III trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug or therapeutic in its final form in an expanded patient population. There can be no assurance that Phase I, Phase II, or Phase III testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Further, clinical trials might be suspended by us or the FDA at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDCA permits the FDA and the IND sponsor to agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in a BLA application. This process is known as Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. These agreements may not be changed after the clinical studies begin, except in limited circumstances. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. The FDA reviews the application for adequacy. We cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA might also refer the application to the appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee. The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review, and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drugs that might be eligible for one or more of these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. We cannot be sure that, if desired, any of our therapeutics will qualify for any of these programs, or that, if a therapeutic does qualify, that the review time will be reduced. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA allows the FDA to approve a follow-on drug or therapeutic on the basis of data in the scientific literature or data used by FDA in the approval of other drugs. This procedure potentially makes it easier for generic drug manufacturers to obtain rapid approval of new forms of therapeutics based on proprietary data of the original drug manufacturer. Before approving a BLA, the FDA usually will inspect any facility at which the drug or therapeutic is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA might issue an approval letter, or in some cases, an approvable letter followed by an approval letter. An approval letter usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or therapeutic for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA might require postmarketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs or therapeutics safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions. 67 After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before we could market any product for additional indications, we would have to obtain additional approvals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. We cannot be sure that additional approval for new indications, if any, will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. Post-Approval Requirements Even after a drug or therapeutic has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA might require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA might withdraw its approval of the drug or therapeutic. In addition, holders of an approved BLA are required to: · report certain adverse reactions to the FDA; · comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and · continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsors records related to safety reporting or manufacturing facilities, including an assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We intend to use third party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections might identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that could disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or noncompliance with regulatory requriements and standards after approval might result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: · restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; · fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; · refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; · product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or · consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Anti-kickback and false claims laws In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute 68 are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also be found to violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Orphan Drug Designations The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or therapeutics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process. If a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the FDA might not approve any other applications to market the same drug or therapeutic for the same indication, except in certain very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs or therapeutics for that indication. We have not applied for orphan drug designation for HS-110. We may apply for orphan drug designation for HS-310, HS-410 and HS-510 if the results of their respective Phase I clinical trials are positive. We have not established a timeline for such applications. Subpart H Approval The FDA may grant marketing approval of a drug or therapeutic under its subpart H regulations. This program makes it possible for a drug or therapeutic candidate for a life-threatening disease to be approved more quickly than the normal application process. Approval is based on a surrogate endpoint or on restrictions to ensure safe usage. The FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug or therapeutic on the basis of one or more adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that establish that the drug or therapeutic has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Approval is subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug or therapeutic further, to verify and describe its clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome. Post-marketing studies generally would be studies already underway. When required to be conducted, such studies must also be adequate and well-controlled. If the FDA concludes that a drug or therapeutic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug or therapeutic product, such as: · distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or · distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures. 69 The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug or therapeutic. Non-U.S. Regulation Before our products can be marketed outside of the U.S., they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product. In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union member states. As of January 1995, a mutual recognition procedure is available at the request of the applicant for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. While we intend to market our products outside the United States in compliance with our respective license agreements, we have not made any applications with non-U.S. authorities and have no timeline for such applications or marketing. Research and Development We have built an internal and external research and development organization that includes expertise in discovery research, preclinical development, product formulation, analytical and medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory and quality assurance. We engage third parties on a limited basis to conduct portions of our preclinical research; however, we are not substantially dependent upon any third parties for our preclinical research nor do any of these third parties conduct a major portion of our preclinical research. Research and development expenses were $902,938 and $1,246,587 during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Employees As of May 1, 2013, we had a total of 12 employees and consultants, of which 6 are full-time employees and 6 are part-time employees or consultants. We believe our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. Facilities We lease approximately 2,111 square feet of office space in Chapel Hill, North Carolina under a lease that expired December 31, 2012, which could be extended for an additional 24 months on substantially the same terms. The monthly lease payments for these facilities, including common area maintenance and related operating expenses, were approximately $3,870. On December 19, 2012, we entered into a lease modification agreement that extended the lease term until July 31, 2013 and the monthly rent was increased to $4,046. Based on our current operational plans, we believe that such facilities are adequate for our operations for the near future.

Our Board is currently comprised of five board members, leaving two vacancies. The Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that until such time as we consummate a firm commitment underwritten public offering for net proceeds of at least $15,000,000 so long as any shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Stock voting as single class have the right to elect one director; so long as any 75 shares of Series A remain outstanding, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock voting as single class have the right to elect one director; so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock voting as single class have the right to elect one director; so long as any shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Stock and the holders of the common stock voting as single class on an as converted basis have the right to elect two directors, the holders of the common stock and Preferred Stock voting together as a single class on an as converted basis are entitled to elect one director; and the holders of the common stock are entitled to elect one director exclusively as a separate class. Committees of the Board of Directors We have applied to have our common stock listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market upon completion of this offering. Under the rules of NASDAQ, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed companys board of directors within twelve months of the completion of an initial public offering. In addition, the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market require that: (i) on the date of the completion of the offering, at least one member of each of a listed companys audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent; (ii) within 90 days of the date of the completion of the offering, a majority of the members of such committees be independent; and (iii) within one year of the date of the completion of the offering, all the members of such committees be independent. Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of that companys board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In order to be considered to be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. Our Board undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our Board has determined that Dr. Belsky, Dr. Kharitonov Dr. Monahan and Mr. Smith, representing four of our five directors, do not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market. In making this determination, our Board considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. We intend to comply with the other independence requirements for committees within the time periods specified above. We currently have: (i) an audit committee comprised of Dr. Monahan,,Mr. Smith, and Mr. Wolf, two of whom are deemed to be independent in accordance with the NASDAQ definition of independence as well as qualify as audit committee financial experts as that term is used in Section 407 of Regulation S-K; (ii) a compensation committee comprised of Dr. Belsky, Dr. Monahan and Dr. Kharitonov, each of whom is deemed to be independent in accordance with the NASDAQ definition of independence; and (iii) a nominating and corporate governance committee comprised of Dr. Belsky, Dr. Kharitonov and Mr. Smith. Dr. Monahan and Mr. Smith are deemed to be independent in accordance with the NASDAQ definition of independence. Dr. Monahan and Mr. Wolf qualify as audit committee financial experts as that term is used in Section 407 of Regulation S-K. Leadership Structure Our Chief Executive Officer also serves as our Chairman of the Board. Our Board does not have a lead independent director. Our board of directors has determined its leadership structure was appropriate and effective for us given our stage of development. 76 2012 Director Compensation Compensation of Directors The following table sets forth information for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 regarding the compensation of our directors who at December 31, 2012 were not also named executive officers.

For more detailed information, please see our articles of incorporation and bylaws. We are authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of which 4,282,281 shares are outstanding and 8,212,500 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.0001 per share, of which 112,500 shares are designated Series 1 Preferred Stock and are outstanding and are currently convertible into 114,908 shares of common stock, 2,000,000 shares are designated Series A Preferred Stock and 1,863,128 shares are outstanding and are currently convertible into 1,863,128 shares of common stock, 4,100,000 are designated as Series B-1 Preferred Stock and 1,891,419 shares are outstanding and are currently convertible into 1,891,419 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 are designated Series B-2 Preferred Stock and we have commitments to purchase 433,122 upon the fulfillment of certain conditions which have not been met and none are currently outstanding. Common Stock The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by the shareholders. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefore. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up, holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are, and all shares of common stock to be outstanding upon completion of this offering will be, fully paid and nonassessable. Preferred Stock Series 1, Series A, Series B Our Board has the authority, without further action by the shareholders, to issue from time to time the Preferred Stock that remains unissued, all of which has been designated as either Series 1 Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, which has rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions which are greater than or senior to the rights of the common stock. The issuance of Preferred Stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and reduce the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. Such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock. The issuance of Preferred Stock or even the ability to issue Preferred Stock could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. Automatic Conversion Each share of Preferred Stock automatically converts to common stock upon the earlier to occur of (i) on the date of consummation of a sale of common stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering resulting in aggregate net cash proceeds to the Company (after deducting applicable underwriting discounts and commissions) of at least $15 million net proceeds; (ii) with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, if 2/3 of the Series A Preferred Stock holders (including one of the larger investors so long as they hold 40% of the Series A Preferred Stock) vote in favor of a conversion then the Series A will automatically convert to common stock; (iii) with respect to the Series 1 Preferred Stock, if 2/3 of the Series 1 Preferred Stock holders vote in favor of a conversion then the Series 1 will automatically convert to common stock; and (iv) with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock if 2/3 of the Series B Preferred Stock holders vote in favor of a conversion then the Series B will automatically convert to common stock. However, if we do not raise net proceeds of $15,000,000 in this offering, or the holders of shares do not vote in favor of conversion, then the Series 1, Series A, Series B-1 and Series B-2 Preferred Stock will not automatically convert to common stock and will remain outstanding. 79 Dividends The Series B Preferred Stock has a priority with respect to dividend distributions and distributions upon liquidation. The Series B Preferred Stock receive dividends when and as and if declared by our Board at a rate of 5% of their original issue price (the Original Issue Price) of such shares which is $2.67 per share for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and $5.00 per share for the Series B-2 Preferred Stock. If we declare or pay a dividend upon the common stock, we must also pay to the holders of the Series A, 1 and B Preferred Stock the dividends that would have been declared with respect to common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A, 1 and B Preferred Stock; provided, however that we cannot declare or pay a dividend unless and until all accrued dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid. Liquidation In the event of a liquidation, the holders of the Series B-1 and B-2 Preferred Stock are entitled to receive before any payment to any other Preferred Stockholder or common stock holder and pari passu with the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Stock an amount per share equal to the greater of $2.67 for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and $5.00 for the Series B-2 Preferred Stock plus any dividends accrued and unpaid whether or not declared. After payment in full of the Series B Preferred Stockholders the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive before any payment to the common stock holder and pari passu with the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Stock an amount per share equal to $2.10 plus any dividends declared but unpaid. In the event of a liquidation, the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Stock are entitled to receive before any payment to the common stock holder and pari passu with any distribution to the Series A Preferred Stock an amount per share equal to $2.35 plus any dividends declared but unpaid. After the payment in full of the amounts set forth above, our assets with be distributed ratably to all holders of common stock and Series B Preferred Stock on an as converted basis except that the Series B Preferred Stockholders shall not continue to share in such distribution after each has received 3 times its Original Issue Price. Voting Rights Each holder of Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on all matters stockholders are entitled to vote and to cast the number of votes as shall equal the whole number of shares of common stock into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible. The Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that so long as any shares of Series 1 remain outstanding, the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Stock voting as single class have the right to elect one director; so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock voting as single class have the right to elect one director; so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock voting as single class have the right to elect one director; so long as any shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Stock and the holders of the common stock voting as single class on an as converted basis have the right to elect two directors, the holders of the common stock and Preferred Stock voting together as a single class on an as converted basis are entitled to elect one director; and the holders of the common stock are entitled to elect one director exclusively as a separate class. All of the rights set forth in the preceding sentence terminate upon consummation of a firm commitment underwritten public offering with net proceeds to us of at least $15,000,000 and following such event the Preferred Stock will have no voting rights except as otherwise required by law. Protective Provisions The Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provide that at any time the Preferred Stock is outstanding the following actions cannot be taken without the consent of at least a majority of the Series B Preferred Stock, at least a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock (which majority must include Brightline Ventures III LLC o its affiliates for so long as Brightline Ventures III LLC holds at least 40% of the Series A Preferred Stock), at least a majority of the Series 1 Preferred Stock and at least a majority of the common stock, each voting as a separate class: (i) amend, alter or repeal any provisions of the Third Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or bylaws; (ii) create, or issue any additional classes of capital stock unless the same ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock in terms of dividends and liquidation or increase the number of authorized shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class of stock unless it ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock in terms of dividends and liquidation; 80 (iii) reclassify, alter or amend any existing security that is pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock in terms of dividends or liquidation if such reclassification would render it senior to the Series A Preferred Stock or reclassify any stock junior to the Series A Preferred Stock in terms of dividends or distributions if such reclassification would render it senior to or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock; (iv) purchase or redeem or pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on shares as approved by the Board, repurchases of former employees, officers or directors or consultant, dividends payable solely in the form of additional shares of stock; (v) Take any action to dissolve or otherwise liquidate the Company; or (vi) Sell all or substantially all of our assets or effect a merger or consolidation unless the Series A Preferred would receive three (3) times their initial investment.

Each holder of Preferred Stock has a right to convert each share of its stock into one share of common stock; however such number is adjusted in certain cases including if we issue convertible securities at a price lower than that paid by the Preferred Stockholders. All of the protective provisions automatically terminate upon consummation of a firm commitment underwritten public offering with gross proceeds to us of at least $15,000,000 and following such event the Preferred Stock will have no voting rights except as otherwise required by applicable law.

The warrants are exercisable at $0.21 per share, vest immediately upon exercise, contain a cashless exercise feature and expire on March 21, 2021. In December 2011, we issued a warrant exercisable for 29,762 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to the North Carolina Biotechnology Center in connection with a loan. The warrant is exercisable for a period of ten years at a price per share of $2.10, contains a cashless exercise feature and contains a weighted average price adjustment feature. In August 2012, we issued a warrant exercisable for 17,500 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to Square 1 Bank in connection with our loan from them.

If not exercised before the expiration date of the warrant, the warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on a cashless basis. With respect to any offering conducted at least twelve months after this offering, the holder of the warrant is entitled to piggyback registration rights with respect to the underlying shares. If we request and Square 1 Bank makes Tranche A Term Loans in an aggregate amount in excess of $1,000,000 then the number of shares for which the warrant is exercisable automatically increases by 25,357. If we issue securities with a per share price less than the warrant price of $2.10, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant is adjusted as provided in our Certificate of Incorporation for our Series A Preferred Stock. In March 2013, we consummated the first tranche of our private placement of our Series B Preferred Stock. In addition to issuing Series B-1 Preferred Stock to investors in the offering, we agreed, at the second tranche closing, to issue to each investor, upon their payment for Series B-2 shares that they have committed to acquire, which is conditioned upon our receipt of certain grant funding, we will issue to each such investor a warrant exercisable for two shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock for each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock purchased by such investor at the second tranche closing.

In 2009, we issued options for an aggregate of 150,219 shares of our common stock to 5 individuals. As of May 1, 2013, all options have vested and 80,000 had been terminated. Of the vested options exercisable, 45,219 have an exercise price of $1.00 and expire in 2019 and 25,000 have an exercise price of $0.0001 and expire in 2019.

As of May 1, 2013, 107,500 of such options had vested and were exercisable and 50,000 had vested and been exercised. The remaining unvested shares of 22,500 will vest by September of 2014. 82 In 2011, we issued options for an aggregate of 768,250 shares of common stock, of which 20,000 shares had terminated resulting in 748,250 options exercisable as of May 1, 2013.

The remaining unvested options of 131,250 will vest at various periods over the next three years at an exercise price of $0.28 per share. In 2012, we issued options exercisable for an aggregate of 411,095 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $0.33 per share that mature in 2022 to 6 individuals and 2 entities. As of May 1, 2013, 261,730 of such options vested and were exercisable and 2,500 had been exercised. The remaining unvested shares of 146,864 vest over the next four years. In 2013, we issued options exercisable for an aggregate of 78,500 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $0.97 per share that mature in 2023 to 7 individuals. As of May 1, 2013, none of such options vested and were exercisable. Convertible Notes In September 2011, convertible notes in the principal amount of $2,623,709 were converted into shares of Series A Preferred Stock, of which notes in the principal amount of $2,273,709 were issued to an investor, the managing member of which is Mr. Smith, a member of our Board. Of such notes, three convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,447,709 were issued in 2011 to two different note holders and the remaining notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,176,000 were issued to two investors in 2010. The notes accrued interest at a rate of 3% per annum and were scheduled to mature 18 months after issuance. In October 2011, in connection with our manufacturing service agreement, we issued a convertible promissory note to our manufacturer, of which $197,099 was outstanding as of December 31, 2012. The note has been extinguished and the payment date for all outstanding payables, including those previously due unter the terms of the Note, has been extended until the closing of this offering. In December 2011, we entered into a loan agreement with the North Carolina Biotechnology Center for an amount up to $250,000. The note evidencing the loan matures on December 13, 2014 and bears interest at a rate of 4.25%. The principal is payable in annual installments in the amount of 5% of the outstanding principal commencing on the one year anniversary of the loan and each one year anniversary thereafter. As of August 31 2012, we had repaid all amounts outstanding under the loan. In August 2012, we entered into a secured loan with Square 1 Bank, the proceeds of which were used in part to pay off the loan from North Carolina Biotechnology Center. The loan and security agreement that we entered with Square 1 Bank in connection with the secured loan (the Square 1 Agreement) provides that Square 1 Bank will provide us with a term loan in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1,000,000 to be used for working capital and capital expenditures (the Tranche A Loan). The Tranche A Loan will be available to us until August 7, 2013. The Tranche A Loan is payable on August 7, 2013 in 36 monthly installments of principal and accrued interest. The Tranche A Loan matures on August 7, 2016. If we receive a grant that provides aggregate funds with a value of $16,000,000, we may request that the maximum aggregate of the Tranche A Loan and the Tranche B Loan amount increases to $2,775,000. The Square 1 Agreement, as amended, also provides that if we receive at least $4,500,000 from the sale of our equity to investors after February 15, 2013 but on or before March 31, 2013 (such date we receive such funds being referred to as the Trigger Date), we can borrow an additional term loan in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1,000,000 to be used for working capital and capital expenditures (the Tranche B Loan). Due to the closing of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock private placement in March 2013, we will be able to borrow an additional $1,000,000 under such loan. The Tranche B Loan is payable as interest-only prior to the twelve month anniversary of the Trigger Date month after until August 7, 2013 and thereafter is payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest until August 7, 2016. The Tranche B Loan matures on August 7, 2016. The Bank also made one term loan in the amount of $225,000, which was used to repay our debt to North Carolina Biotechnology Center (the Term B Loan). The Term B Loan matures December 14, 2014 and requires payments on the one and two year anniversary of the date of issuance equal to five percent of the principal amount of the loan plus accrued interest, with the balance of the loan being paid on maturity. Once repaid the loans may not be re-borrowed. The loans are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, including our stock in our 83 subsidiaries but excluding our intellectual property. Finally, the Bank also made one Non-Formula Advance (the Non-Formula Advance) in the aggregate principal amount of $200,000 which was paid in full in 2013. As of May 1, 2013, we had outstanding $725,000 under the Square 1 Bank loans. Under the loan agreement, as amended, we were required to raise an additional $4,500,000 on or prior to March 31, 2013. This equity milestone was satisfied and the Company is currently in full compliance with all loan covenants. In connection with the loan, we issued Square 1 Bank a warrant exercisable for 17,500 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. The warrant is exercisable for ten years at a price of $2.10 which price is subject to adjustment for certain transactions including certain dilutive transactions.

As described below, approximately shares currently outstanding will not be available for sale immediately after this offering due to certain contractual and securities law restrictions on resale. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after these restrictions lapse could cause the prevailing market price to decline and limit our ability to raise equity capital in the future. Upon completion of this offering, we will have outstanding an aggregate of shares of common stock ( shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full). In addition, we have reserved: · 122,262 shares for issuance in connection with warrants outstanding as of May 1, 2013; · 1,435,564 shares for issuance in connection with options outstanding as of May 1, 2013; · 282,155 shares reserved for future issuance in under our equity incentive plans as of May 1, 2012 of which 49,100 shares have been reserved for option grants to be issued upon consummation of our initial public offering; and Of these shares, the shares sold in this offering ( shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) will be freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares that are acquired by affiliates as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (Rule 144). The remaining shares of common stock held by existing stockholders are restricted securities, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if registered or if their resale qualifies for exemption from registration described below under Rule 144 or 701 promulgated under the Securities Act. As a result of contractual restrictions described below and the provisions of Rules 144 and 701, the shares sold in this offering and the restricted securities will be available for sale in the public market as follows: · the shares sold in this offering ( shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) and of the existing restricted shares will be eligible for immediate sale upon the completion of this offering; and · approximately restricted shares will be eligible for sale in the public market upon expiration of lock-up agreements 180 days after the date of this prospectus, which date may be extended in specified circumstances, subject in certain circumstances to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 and Rule 701.

A non-affiliated person who has beneficially owned restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 for at least one year would be entitled to sell those shares without regard to the provisions of Rule 144. An affiliate of ours who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least twelve months (or six months, provided that such sale occurs after we have been subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act for at least 90 days) would be entitled to sell, within any three-month period, a number of shares that does not exceed 1% of shares of our common stock then outstanding. Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to manner of sale provisions, notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us. 88 Rule 701 Under Rule 701, common stock acquired upon the exercise of certain currently outstanding options or pursuant to other rights granted under our stock plans may be resold, to the extent not subject to lock-up agreements, (a) by persons other than affiliates, beginning 90 days after the effective date of this offering, subject only to the manner-of-sale provisions of Rule 144 and (b) by affiliates, subject to the manner-of-sale, current public information and filing requirements of Rule 144, in each case, without compliance with the holding period requirement of Rule 144.

In addition, Square 1 Bank has piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares underlying the warrant it holds. 89 MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK The following discussion describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to non-U.S. holders (as defined below) of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common stock issued pursuant to the initial public offering. This discussion is not a complete analysis of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences and does not address any tax consequences arising under any state, local or foreign tax laws, any income tax treaties, or any other U.S. federal tax laws, including U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws (except as specifically addressed herein with respect to U.S federal estate taxes). This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), all as in effect on the date of the initial public offering. These authorities may change, possibly retroactively, resulting in tax consequences different from those discussed below. No rulings have been or will be sought from the IRS with respect to the matters discussed below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position regarding the tax consequences of a non-U.S. holders acquisition, ownership or disposition of our common stock or that any such position would not be sustained by a court. This discussion is limited to non-U.S. holders who purchase our common stock pursuant to this offering and who hold our common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Code Section 1221 (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a non-U.S. holder in light of the holders particular circumstances. It also does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may be relevant to non-U.S. holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation, U.S. expatriates, banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, brokers, dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities), tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, and persons holding our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment. WE RECOMMEND THAT PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATIES, OR ANY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS). Definition of Non-U.S. Holder As used in this discussion, a non-U.S. holder is any beneficial owner of our common stock who is not treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not: · an individual citizen or resident of the United States; · a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; · an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or · a trust if (i) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have authority to control all its substantial decisions or (ii) the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996, was treated as a U.S. person prior to that date and validly elected to continue to be so treated. If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and their partners should consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences to them of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common stock. 90 Distributions on Our Common Stock As described in the section entitled, Dividend Policy, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we make a distribution of cash or other property with respect to our common stock, the distribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Amounts not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will constitute a return of capital and will first be applied against and reduce a holders adjusted tax basis in its common stock, but not below zero. Any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain from the sale of property. Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock that are not effectively connected to the holders conduct of a U.S. trade or business generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends, or a lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a valid IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable successor form) certifying the holders qualification for the reduced rate. A non-U.S. holder may be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number to claim treaty benefits. This certification must be provided to us or our paying agent prior to the payment of dividends and may be required to be updated periodically. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide us or our paying agent with the required certification, but which qualify for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under a relevant income tax treaty. If a non-U.S. holder holds our common stock in connection with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and dividends paid on the common stock are effectively connected with the holders U.S. trade or business and, if an income tax treaty applies, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which the dividends are attributable, the non-U.S. holder will be exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax, if the appropriate certification is provided. To claim the exemption for effectively connected income, the non-U.S. holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or applicable successor form) prior to the payment of the dividends. Any dividends paid on our common stock that are effectively connected with a non-U.S. holders U.S. trade or business generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if the holder were a resident of the United States, unless the holder is entitled to the benefits of a tax treaty that provides otherwise. A non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year that are attributable to such dividends. Non-U.S. holders should consult any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules. Gain on Disposition of Our Common Stock Subject to the discussions below regarding backup withholding and foreign accounts, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our common stock unless: · the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder ’ s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; · the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met; or · our common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest by reason of our status as a U.S. real property holding corporation at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or the non-U.S. holder ’ s holding period for our common stock and certain other requirements are met. Unless an applicable tax treaty provides otherwise, gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if the holder were a resident of the United States. Non-U.S. holders that are foreign corporations also may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year that are attributable to such gain. Non-U.S. holders should consult any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules. 91 Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30% rate (or a lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), but may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. With respect to the third bullet point above, we believe we currently are not and will not become a U.S. real property holding corporation. However, because the determination of whether we are a U.S. real property holding corporation generally depends on whether the fair market value of our U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of our other trade or business assets and our worldwide real property interests, there can be no assurance that we will not become a U.S. real property holding corporation in the future. In the event we do become a U.S. real property holding corporation, as long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, our common stock will constitute a U.S. real property interest only with respect to a non-U.S. holder that actually or constructively holds more than five percent of our common stock at some time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or the non-U.S. holders holding period for our common stock. Any taxable gain generally will be taxed in the same manner as gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding We must report annually to the IRS and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends on our common stock paid to the holder and the amount of any tax withheld with respect to those dividends. These information reporting requirements apply even if no withholding was required because the dividends were effectively connected with the holders conduct of a U.S. trade or business, or withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. This information also may be made available under a specific treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28%, generally will not apply to payments of dividends to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock provided the non-U.S. holder furnishes to us or our paying agent the required certification as to its non-U.S. status (typically, by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI) or an exemption is otherwise established. Payment of the proceeds from a non-U.S. holders disposition of our common stock made by or through a foreign office of a broker will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding, except that information reporting (but generally not backup withholding) may apply to those payments if the broker does not have documentary evidence that the beneficial owner is a non-U.S. holder, an exemption is not otherwise established and the broker is: · a U.S. person, as defined in the Code; · a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; · a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business for a specified three-year period; or · a foreign partnership if at any time during its tax year (1) one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who hold in the aggregate more than 50% of the income or capital interest in the partnership or (2) it is engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. Payment of the proceeds from a non-U.S. holders disposition of our common stock made by or through the U.S. office of a broker generally will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the non-U.S. holder certifies as to its non-U.S. status (such as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI) or otherwise establishes an exemption from information reporting and backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Taxpayers may use amounts withheld as a credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability or may claim a refund if they timely provide certain information to the IRS. U.S. Federal Estate Tax Shares of common stock held (or deemed held) by an individual who is a non-U.S. holder at the time of his or her death will be included in such non-U.S. holders gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise, and thus may be subject to U.S. federal estate tax. 92 Additional Withholding Tax Relating to Foreign Accounts Legislation enacted in 2010 will generally impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our common stock paid after December 31, 2012 to a foreign financial institution (whether holding stock for its own account or on behalf of its account holders/investors) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners). The legislation will also generally impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our common stock paid after December 31, 2012 to any other foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. Recent administrative guidance provides, however, that such withholding would generally apply only to dividends paid on or after January 1, 2014, and to other withholdable payments (including payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock) made on or after January 1, 2017. Under certain circumstances, a holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible impact of these rules on their investment in our common stock. WE RECOMMEND THAT PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATIES, OR ANY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS). 93 UNDERWRITING Aegis Capital Corp. is acting as the sole book-running manager of the offering and as representative of the underwriters, or the Representative. We have entered into an underwriting agreement, dated , 2013, with the Representative. Subject to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, we have agreed to sell to each underwriter named below and each underwriter named below has severally and not jointly agreed to purchase from us, at the public offering price per share less the underwriting discounts set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, the number of shares of common stock listed next to its name in the following table: Underwriter Number of Shares Aegis Capital Corp Total The underwriters are committed to purchase all the shares of common stock offered by us other than those covered by the option to purchase additional shares described below, if they purchase any shares. The obligations of the underwriters may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the underwriting agreement. Furthermore, pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the underwriters obligations are subject to customary conditions, representations and warranties contained in the underwriting agreement, such as receipt by the underwriters of officers certificates and legal opinions. We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect thereof. The underwriters are offering the shares, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel and other conditions specified in the underwriting agreement. The underwriters reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part. We have granted the underwriters an over-allotment option. This option, which is exercisable for up to 45 days after the date of this prospectus, permits the underwriters to purchase a maximum of additional shares (15% of the shares sold in this offering) from us to cover over-allotments, if any. If the underwriters exercise all or part of this option, they will purchase shares covered by the option at the public offering price per share that appears on the cover page of this prospectus, less the underwriting discount. If this option is exercised in full, the total price to the public will be $ and the total net proceeds, before expenses, to us will be $ . Discount. The following table shows the public offering price, underwriting discount and proceeds, before expenses, to us. The information assumes either no exercise or full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option. Per Share Total Without Over-allotment Option Total With Over-allotment Option Public offering price $ $ $ Underwriting discount (7%) $ $ $ Non-accountable expense allowance (1%) (1) $ $ $ Proceeds, before expenses, to us $ $ $  (1) The expense allowance of 1% is not payable with respect to the shares sold upon exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. The underwriters propose to offer the shares to the public at the public offering price per share set forth on the cover of this prospectus. In addition, the underwriters may offer some of the shares to other securities dealers at such price less a concession of $ per share. If all of the shares offered by us are not sold at the public offering price per share, the underwriters may change the offering price per share and other selling terms by means of a supplement to this prospectus. 94 We have paid an expense deposit of $25,000 to the Representative, which will be applied against the accountable expenses that will be paid by us to the Representative in connection with this offering. The underwriting agreement provides that in the event the offering is terminated, the $25,000 expense deposit paid to the Representative will be returned to us to the extent that offering expenses are not actually incurred by the Representative. We have also agreed to pay the Representatives expenses relating to the offering, including (a) all fees, expenses and disbursements relating to background checks of our officers and directors in an amount not to exceed $2,500 per individual and $15,000 in the aggregate; (b) all filing fees incurred in clearing this offering with FINRA (and the reasonable fees of FINRA counsel, but only up to $15,000); (c) all fees, expenses and disbursements relating to the registration, qualification or exemption of securities offered under the securities laws of foreign jurisdictions designated by the underwriters; (d) upon successfully completing this offering, $21,775 for the underwriters use of Ipreos book-building, prospectus tracking and compliance software for this offering; and (e) upon successfully completing this offering, up to $20,000 of the Representatives actual accountable road show expenses for the offering. We estimate that the total expenses of the offering payable by us, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ . Discretionary Accounts . The underwriters do not intend to confirm sales of the securities offered hereby to any accounts over which they have discretionary authority. Lock-Up Agreements . Pursuant to certain lock-up agreements, we, our executive officers and directors, And all holders of our outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis (including shares underlying options, warrants and convertible securities) have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of or announce the intention to otherwise dispose of, or enter into any swap, hedge or similar agreement or arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic risk of ownership of, directly or indirectly, engage in any short selling of any common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any common stock, whether currently owned or subsequently acquired, without the prior written consent of the Representative, for a period of 180 days from the date of effectiveness of the offering. The lock-up period described in the preceding paragraph will be automatically extended if: (1) during the last 17 days of the restricted period, we issue an earnings release or announce material news or a material event; or (2) prior to the expiration of the lock-up period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the lock-up period, in which case the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date of the earnings release, unless the Representative waives this extension in writing; provided, however, that this lock-up period extension shall not apply to the extent that FINRA has amended or repealed NASD Rule 2711(f)(4), or has otherwise provided written interpretive guidance regarding such rule, in each case, so as to eliminate the prohibition of any broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association from publishing or distributing any research report, with respect to the securities of an emerging growth company (as defined in the JOBS Act) prior to or after the expiration of any agreement between the broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association and the emerging growth company or its shareholders that restricts or prohibits the sale of securities held by the emerging growth company or its shareholders after the initial public offering date. Representatives Warrants. We have agreed to issue to the Representative warrants to purchase up to a total of shares of common stock (5% of the shares of common stock sold in this offering, but excluding the over-allotment option). The warrants will be exercisable at any time, and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four-year period commencing one year from the effective date of the offering, which period shall not extend further than five years from the effective date of the offering in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(H)(i). The warrants are exercisable at a per share price equal to $ per share, or 125% of the public offering price per share in the offering. The warrants have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180 day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of FINRA. The Representative (or permitted assignees under Rule 5110(g)(1)) will not sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or hypothecate these warrants or the securities underlying these warrants, nor will they engage in any hedging, short sale, derivative, put, or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of the warrants or the underlying securities for a period of 180 days from the date of effectiveness. In addition, the warrants provide for registration rights upon request, in certain cases. The demand registration right 95 provided will not be greater than five years from the effective date of the offering in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(H)(iv). The piggyback registration right provided will not be greater than seven years from the effective date of the offering in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(H)(v). We will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities issuable on exercise of the warrants other than underwriting commissions incurred and payable by the holders. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrant exercise price or underlying shares will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below the warrant exercise price. Right of First Refusal. Subject to certain limited exceptions, until twelve (12) months after the date of effectiveness of the offering, the Representative has a right of first refusal to purchase for its account or to sell for our account, or any subsidiary or successor, any securities of our company or any such subsidiary or successor which we or any subsidiary or successor may seek to sell in public or private equity and public debt offerings during such twelve (12)-month period. NASDAQ Capital Market Listing. We have applied for the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "HEAX". Electronic Offer, Sale and Distribution of Shares. A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the websites maintained by one or more of the underwriters or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering and one or more of the underwriters participating in this offering may distribute prospectuses electronically. The Representative may agree to allocate a number of shares to underwriters and selling group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the underwriters and selling group members that will make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations. Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on these websites is not part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, has not been approved or endorsed by us or any underwriter in its capacity as underwriter, and should not be relied upon by investors. Determination of the Initial Public Offering Price . Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price was determined through negotiations between us and the Representative of the underwriters. In addition to prevailing market conditions, the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price included the following: · the information included in this prospectus and otherwise available to the Representative; · the valuation multiples of publicly traded companies that the Representative believes to be comparable to us; · our financial information; · our prospects and the history and the prospectus of the industry in which we compete; · an assessment of our management, its past and present operations, and the prospects for, and timing of, our future revenues; · the present state of our development; and · the above factors in relation to market values and various valuation measures of other companies engaged in activities similar to ours. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop. It is also possible that, after the offering, the shares will not trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price. 96 Stabilization. In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions, syndicate-covering transactions, penalty bids and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. · Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase shares so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum, and are engaged in for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the shares while the offering is in progress. · Over-allotment transactions involve sales by the underwriters of shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriters are obligated to purchase. This creates a syndicate short position which may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of shares over-allotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of shares that they may purchase in the over-allotment option. In a naked short position, the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in the over-allotment option. The underwriters may close out any short position by exercising their over-allotment option and/or purchasing shares in the open market. · Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of shares in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared with the price at which they may purchase shares through exercise of the over-allotment option. If the underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by exercise of the over-allotment option and, therefore, have a naked short position, the position can be closed out only by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that after pricing there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. · Penalty bids permit the Representative to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the shares originally sold by that syndicate member are purchased in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions to cover syndicate short positions. These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our shares or common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our shares or common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock in the open market may be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. Neither we nor the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock. These transactions may be effected on The NASDAQ Capital Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. Passive market making . In connection with this offering, underwriters and selling group members may engage in passive market making transactions in our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market in accordance with Rule 103 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, during a period before the commencement of offers or sales of the shares and extending through the completion of the distribution. A passive market maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid of that security. However, if all independent bids are lowered below the passive market makers bid, then that bid must then be lowered when specified purchase limits are exceeded. Other Relationships . Certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us and our affiliates for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees. However, except as disclosed in this prospectus, we have no present arrangements with any of the underwriters for any further services. 97 Offer restrictions outside the United States Other than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the underwriters that would permit a public offering of the securities offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2012 and the period from June 10, 2008 (inception) to December 31, 2012 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

F-8 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Organization Heat Biologics, Inc., (Heat), was incorporated in 2008 pursuant to the laws of the state of Delaware. Heat Biologics, Inc. is a development stage company focused on the development and commercialization of ImPact Therapy, a platform technology that offers a novel approach to treating cancer and other diseases by using live, modified cell lines to activate the immune system against specific defined targets. Heat is currently in Phase II clinical trials with its first drug for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. During 2010 and part of 2011, Heat was based in Miami Beach, Florida. In July 2011, Heat moved all administrative operations to Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Heat has owned 92.5% interests in two subsidiaries, Heat Biologics I, Inc. and Heat Biologics II, Inc. since their incorporation in the state of Delaware and commencement of operations on April 28, 2009. In April of 2012, the Board of Directors approved the sale of Heats entire 92.5% interest in Heat II. An independent appraisal report, issued on April 18, 2012, was concurrently approved by the Board as an accurate assessment of Heat IIs fair market value of $0.0025 per share. On June 25, 2012 a stock purchase agreement was executed for the purchase of 3,700,000 shares of Heat II common stock by a related party. The operations of Heat II through June 25, 2012, including fiscal year 2011 and 2010, and inception to date, are presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a loss from discontinued operations and on the consolidated balance sheets as liabilities related to discontinued operations. On May 30, 2012, Heat formed two-wholly owned subsidiaries, Heat Biologics III, Inc. (Heat III) and Heat Biologics, IV, Inc. (Heat IV). Heat also formed Heat Biologics GmbH (Heat GmbH), a wholly-owned limited liability company, organized in Germany on September 11, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, there had been no activity within Heat III, Heat IV, and Heat GmbH other than their formations. Heats product candidates require clinical trials and approvals from regulatory agencies, as well as acceptance in the marketplace. Part of Heats strategy is to develop and commercialize some of its product candidates by continuing existing arrangements with academic and corporate collaborators and licensees and by entering into new collaborations. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting Heat prepares its consolidated financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Activities during the development stage include developing the business plan, raising capital, and developing the Companys platform technology. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Heat Biologics, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Heat Biologics I, Inc. (Heat I) and Heat Biologics II, Inc (Heat II), Heat Biologics III, Inc (Heat III), Heat Biologics IV, Inc. (Heat IV) and Heat Biologics GmbH. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 Heat held a 92.5% controlling interest in Heat I and accounts for its less than 100% interest in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the Company presents non-controlling interests as a component of stockholders deficit on its consolidated balance sheets and reports non-controlling interest net income (loss) under the heading net income (loss)  non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of operations. In June 2012, the Company sold its entire 92.5% interest in Heat II. The operations of Heat II through June 25, 2012, including fiscal year 2011, and inception to date, are presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a loss from discontinued operations and on the consolidated balance sheets as liabilities related to discontinued operations. F-9 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The Company considers all cash and other highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company had a restricted cash balance of $26,214 and $1,712 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The United States Patent and Trade Office (USPTO) requires the Company to maintain an account with a minimum of $1,000 to be used to pay fees associated with new trademarks of the Company and one of the Companys lenders requires a minimum $25,000 cash balance to be maintained with the lending bank. Concentration of Credit Risk At times, cash balances may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurable limits. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances. All of the Companys cash balances were fully insured at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. Debt Issuance Costs, net Debt issuance costs include the costs incurred to obtain financing, including the fair value of preferred stock warrants at the date of issuance, and are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the life of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets net of amortization. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are capitalized if the cost exceeds $500. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and is based on estimated useful lives of 3 years for computer equipment and seven years for furniture and fixtures. Preferred Stock Warrant Liability In December 2011 and August 2012, the Company entered into a promissory note with each of two lenders and issued preferred stock warrants to each lender as consideration. The Company accounts for these freestanding warrants to purchase the Companys Series A Preferred Stock as liabilities at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The warrants may only be settled in shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The warrants are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date, and the change in fair value, if any, is recognized as other income (expense). The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of (i) exercise of the warrants, (ii) conversion of the warrants into warrants to purchase common stock upon an event such as the completion of an initial public offering or (iii) expiration of the warrants. Upon conversion, the preferred stock warranty liability will be reclassified into additional paid-in capital. The Monte Carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical method used to generate a defined number of stock price paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of the range of the Companys future expected stock prices and minimizes standard error. F-1 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Significant assumptions used in the valuation of the warrants were as follows: December 31, 2012 2011 Exercise price $2.10 $2.10 Risk-free interest rate 1.78% 1.65%-1.92% Expected volatility 75.6-76.3% 75.1-76.7% Expected life (years) 10 10 Expected dividend yield 0% 0% Net Loss per Share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Fully diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive securities outstanding during each year. Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss per share are excluded from the calculation. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of certain of the Companys financial instruments, including prepaid expenses and other current assets, other assets, deposits, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables, and related party payable approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of the Companys notes payable approximated fair value because the interest rates under those obligations approximate market rates of interest available to the Company for similar instruments. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of the Companys financial instruments, the Company utilizes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level I  Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level II  Observable inputs, other than Level I prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level III  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. The Companys financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist only of the preferred stock warrant liability. The Companys preferred stock warrant liability is classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. The change in the fair value of the Level III preferred stock warrant liability is summarized below: December 31, 2012 2011 Fair value at beginning of year $ 56,930 $ - Issuances 31,680 55,890 Change in fair value at end of year 3,540 1,040 Fair value at end of year $ 92,150 $ 56,930 F-2 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Marketing Marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Marketing expense totaled $5,921 and $18,380 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Marketing expenses from inception through December 31, 2012 totaled $47,908. Income Tax Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In accordance with FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes , the Company reflects in the financial statements the benefit of positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return only when it is considered more-likely-than-not that the position taken will be sustained by a taxing authority. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no unrecognized income tax benefits and correspondingly there is no impact on the Companys effective income tax rate associated with these items. The Companys policy for recording interest and penalties relating to uncertain income tax positions is to record them as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying statements of income. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no such accruals. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and non-employee directors using a fair value method which requires the recognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based payments, including stock options. The fair value method requires the Company to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value of the underlying option calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates and expected term. The expected volatility rates are estimated based on the actual volatility of comparable public companies over the expected term. The expected term for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company has not paid dividends and does not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future and, accordingly, uses an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards. The measurement of nonemployee share-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest and is recognized as an expense over the period over which services are received. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests is the result of the Company's consolidation of subsidiaries of which it does not own 100%. The Company's net loss attributable to non-controlling interests relates to the University's ownership in Heat I, and its ownership of in Heat II before the divestiture of Heat II. F-3 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue associated with various grant contracts on a reimbursement basis. Each contract outlines the parameters for receiving the funds. The Company recognizes the funding from these contracts as revenue as the expenses associated with meeting the contracts are incurred and submitted to the funding source for reimbursement and the amounts are deemed collectible. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company has acquired exclusive licensing rights to intellectual property to further its research and development. These costs are expensed as incurred. The Company also incurs legal costs relating to the filing and application fees for patents which are owned by the universities with which the Company has license agreements. These costs are also expensed as research and development expense as incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) to converge the fair value measurement guidance in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Some of the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements, while other amendments change particular principles in fair value measurement guidance. In addition, the amendments require additional fair value disclosures. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively. These amendments impact the Companys financial statement disclosures only and became effective in 2012. The amendments did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In August 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2012-03, Technical Amendments and Corrections to SEC Sections to amend various SEC sections in the Accounting Standards Codification as a result of (1) the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 114; (2) the issuance of SEC Release No. 33-9250; and (3) corrections related to ASU 2010-22, Technical Corrections to SEC Paragraphs . The new guidance was effective upon issuance, and the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In October 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-04  Technical Corrections and Improvements . The amendments in this Update cover a wide range of topics within the codification, as they incorporate multiple improvements provided through the codifications feedback process. Amendments have been made to source literature, guidance clarification, reference corrections and relocations of guidance. Amendments that do not have transition guidance were effective upon issuance. Amendments subject to transition guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2012. We will adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2013 and we do not anticipate any effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations as a result of adoption. 3. Discontinued Operations In April of 2012, the Company's board approved a plan to sell its 92.5% interest in Heat II to a related party entity. On June 25, 2012, the Company sold all of its interest to the related party in exchange for $9,250 in cash and a receivable from the related party of $296,244. The receivable is due in full approximately seven years from the date of the transaction with interest accruing at a rate of 6% per annum. The Company performed a fair value analysis of the receivable from the related party and determined that due to the uncertainty surrounding the collectibility of the receivable, the fair value was $0. The Company's estimate of the fair value of the receivable is based upon several factors including the long-term maturity of the receivable, an analysis of the related party's ability and willingness to pay the receivable given the current financial position, and that fact that Heat II is likely years away from generating product revenues. F-4 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The $9,250 in cash was recorded as a reduction to the loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. The operations of Heat II through June 25, 2012, including fiscal year 2011, and inception to date, are presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a loss from discontinued operations and on the consolidated balance sheets as liabilities related to discontinued operations. 4.

Non-cash Consideration for Rent Non-cash consideration for rent represents office space and other utilities provided by an unrelated entity on behalf of the Company during the years ended December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2010. No cash was transferred for the utilization of the space. The fair market value of the non-cash consideration was calculated using market rental rates and the square footage of office space provided. Equity Compensation Plan 2009 Stock Incentive Plan In 2009, the Company adopted the 2009 Stock Option Plan of Heat Biologics, Inc. (the 2009 Plan), under which stock options to acquire 500,000 common shares could be granted to key employees, directors, and independent contractors. Under the 2009 Plan, both incentive and non-qualified stock options could be granted under terms and conditions established by the Board of Directors. The exercise price for incentive stock options was the fair market value of the related common stock on the date the stock option was granted. Stock options granted under the 2009 Plan generally have terms of 10 years and have various vesting schedules. The Company amended the 2009 Stock Option Plan and all related addendum agreements in April 2011. This second amendment increased the number of shares available for issuance from 500,000 to 1,500,000. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were 1,357,064 and 1,085,344 and stock options outstanding under the 2009 Plan, respectively. The following table summarizes the components of the Companys stock-based compensation included in net loss: December 31, 2012 2011 Employee stock options $ 60,956 $ 51,686 Non-employee stock options 128,157 11,324 Restricted stock awards 28,783 16,540 $ 217,896 $ 79,550 F-11 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Stock Options The Company granted options in 2012, 2011, and 2010. The fair market value of the stock options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: December 31, 2012 2011 Risk-free interest rate 0.72  0.97% 0.71 - 1.16% Expected volatility 80-90% 70% Expected life (years) 5.0 - 6.25 3.5 - 6.25 Expected dividend yield 0% 0% The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury interest rates at the time of the grant whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. The Company used an average historical stock price volatility based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of comparable companies that have issued stock options with substantially similar terms, as the Company did not have any trading history for its common stock. Expected term represents the period that the Companys stock option grants are expected to be outstanding. The Company elected to utilize the simplified method to value stock option grants. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option. Expected dividend yield was considered to be $0 in the option pricing formula since the Company had not paid any dividends and had no plans to do so in the future. The forfeiture rate was considered to be none insofar as the historical experience of the Company is very limited. As required by ASC 718, the Company will adjust the estimated forfeiture rate based upon actual experience. The Company recognized stock compensation expense of $217,896 and $79,550 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively for the Companys stock option awards.

This increase was primarily due to the generation of additional net operating loss carryforwards and income tax credits. The Company has approximately $11,408,032 of federal and state operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2023. F-15 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements In accordance with FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes , the Company reflects in the financial statements the benefit of positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return only when it is considered more-likely-than-not that the position taken will be sustained by a taxing authority. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had no unrecognized income tax benefits and correspondingly there is no impact on the Companys effective income tax rate associated with these items. The Companys policy for recording interest and penalties relating to uncertain income tax positions is to record them as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying statements of income. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no such accruals. The Company files income tax returns in the United States and various state jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for the tax years ended December 31, 2008 through 2012. 12.

In 2011, the Company issued additional convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,347,709 to the same investor.

F-16 Heat Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements In June 2012, the Company sold its 92.5% ownership interest in Heat II to a related party in exchange for $9,250 in cash and a receivable of $296,224 to be paid in full in seven years from the date of the purchase.

See additional related party transactions in Note 6, Convertible Notes Payable and Note 10, Stockholders Deficit. 14. Net Loss per Common Share Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Fully diluted net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods. Common equivalent shares consist of stock options that are computed using the treasury stock method. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, all of the Companys common stock options and warrants, preferred stock, and preferred stock warrants are anti-dilutive and therefore have been excluded from the diluted calculation. 15. Subsequent Events On January 10, 2013 the Company signed a Second Amendment to its Loan and Security Agreement which granted an extension of credit in the form of a Non-Formula Revolving Line (the Line) for an amount up to $200,000. This increase in credit was through a limited guaranty by an investor who secured the additional obligation by maintaining as collateral a money market account of a minimum of $200,000 with the bank. This guarantee was only for the amounts arising from the Line. It was the intention of both the investor and the Company that the Line was to be repaid within a reasonable time period after the successful raise of capital but no later than January 9, 2014, the maturity date of the Line. The payoff of the Line would release the investor of its obligation to the bank. The Line was repaid in March 2013, and thus the collateral funds have been returned to the investor. On February 28, 2013, the Company signed a Third Amendment to its Loan and Security Agreement which waived the Equity Milestone covenant violation by extending the requirement of an equity raise of at least $5,000,000 to February 15, 2013. On March 19, 2013 the Company signed a Fourth Amendment to its Loan and Security Agreement which waived the Equity Milestone covenant violation by reducing the required capital raise from $5,000,000 to $4,500,000 and extending the due date of funds received from the sale of the Companys equity securities to March 31, 2013. In February of 2013, the Company executed a term sheet to obtain additional financing from current and outside investors at a minimum of $8,350,000 and maximum of $12,500,000. The investment would consist of a two tranche capital raise comprised of the sale of Series B-1 Preferred with warrants convertible into Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the sale of Series B-2 Preferred Stock. The purchase price per share is $2.67 and $5.00 for Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively. The first tranche will be used primarily for working capital of the Company. The second tranche would be used in combination with potential grant funding to further develop clinical programs pursuant to the Companys business plan. The Series B-2 financing must occur on or before the first anniversary of the first closing. The Series B-1 financing may waive in its sole discretion the grant funding requirement as a condition of the second closing. On March 31, 2013, the first closing occurred raising $5,050,050 for the purchase of Series B-1 Preferred Stock along with further commitments to purchase $2,165,650 of Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon the approval of an application for grant funding. The receipt of $5,015,050 by March 31, 2013 satisfied the Equity Milestone so that the Company is in full compliance with all covenants associated with the Loan and Security Agreement.

Undertakings (a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement. (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed on the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of the securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (§230.424 of this chapter); (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. (f) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. (h) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. II-5 (i) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
