THERE IS NO MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENT FOR THE OFFERING TO PROCEED. SAVDEN GROUP CORP. 5,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK $0.02 PER SHARE This is the initial offering of common stock of SavDen Group Corp. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are registering for sale a total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.02 per share to the general public in best efforts offering. We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Denis Savinskii, will attempt to sell the shares. We are making this offering without the involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers. This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. Mr. Savinskii will sell all the shares registered herein. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.02 per share for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (180 days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 5,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 5,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. SavDen Group Corp. is a development stage company and has recently started its operations. To date we have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We do not have sufficient capital to commence operations. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can afford the loss of your investment. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop. We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. SAVDEN GROUP CORP. SavDen Group Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on October 2, 2014. We are development stage company and intend to commence operations in the business of software development. We intend to provide a business planning service (software) mainly aimed at at medium-sized and small companies in order to help them to develop their businesses or make presentations of their businesses to investors. We plan to offer a multilingual online computing platform in a form of a web site and a cloud based webstorage with pay per use system as a service. The services are going to be delivered without the cost and and complexity of buying and managing software, providing all of the facilities required to support the complete cycle of building and delivering business plans. Our offerings may include team collaboration within a particular business plan, converting business plans to different document formats (such as clear PDF files), sharing business plans, security of data and data storage. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $42,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate any revenue. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at Griegstrasse, 9  Nesonova, Stuttgart, Germany 70195. Our phone number is +44 20 8133 4952. From inception (October 2, 2014) until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (October 2, 2014) through May 31, 2015, reports no revenue and a net loss of $585. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for SavDen Group Corp., which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and developed concepts of our software. As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop. Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with your business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000, our business may fail. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or services related to our planned activities. 5 | Page THE OFFERING The Issuer: Savden Group Corp. Securities Being Offered: 5,000,000 shares of common stock.

Registration Costs We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. Risk Factors See Risk Factors and the other information in this prospectus for a discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering. 6 | Page SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The tables and information below are derived from our audited financial statements for the period from October 2, 2014 (Inception) to May 31, 2015: Financial Summary May 31, 2015 ($) (Audited) Cash and Deposits 220 Total Assets 220 Total Liabilities 805 Total Stockholders Deficit (585) Statement of Operations Accumulated From October 2, 2014 (Inception) to May 31, 2015 ($) (Audited) Total Expenses 585 Net Loss for the Period (585) RISK FACTORS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHEN AND IF WE TRADE AT A LATER DATE, COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED A GOING CONCERN, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment. WE MAY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY, AND IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS. We are company with limited operations, have incurred expenses and have losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new products and service introductions, and competition. 7 | Page WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. As of May 31, 2015, we had cash in the amount of $220 and liabilities of $805. As of this date, we have no income and just recently started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Denis Savinskii, our sole officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Mr. Savinskii has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations. WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We were incorporated on October 2, 2014 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL. We have no experience in the social media or internet industries, and have only nominal sales and marketing experience. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our software will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services. 8 | Page ANY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICE COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers will be dependent upon the reliable performance of the software, website or application network infrastructure and fulfillment processes (how we deliver services purchased by our customers). Prolonged or frequent interruptions in any of these systems could make our software unavailable or unusable, which could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential customers. OUR SOFTWARE MAY BE DISPLACED BY NEWER TECHNOLOGY. IT and Internet technologies are undergoing rapid and significant technological change. Other companies may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than those developed or marketed by us, or that would make our product obsolete or non-competitive. Accordingly, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond quickly to technological changes through the development and introduction of new products. We may not have the resources to do this. If our product candidates become obsolete and our efforts to secure and develop new products do not result in any commercially successful products, our sales and revenues will decline. WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. The business of niche of software development is very competitive. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful softwares operated by proven companies that offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful. These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service. If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DOMINATE THE MARKET, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES. Some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS. We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations. 9 | Page BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS. Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN MORE THAN 50% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS. Mr. Savinskii, our sole officer and director, will own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Savinskii may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSON, THE LOSS OF WHOM MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY. Currently, we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director. We depend entirely on Denis Savinskii for all of our operations. The loss of Mr. Savinskii would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Mr. Savinskii has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Savinskiis services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel. We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future. BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING ENOUGH CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS. Denis Savinskii, our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations. He will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week to our operations. Because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations. 10 | Page OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. We have never operated as a public company. Denis Savinskii, our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DO NOT RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE U.S. STOCKHOLDERS WOULD FACE DIFFICULTY IN EFFECTING SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST OUR OFFICERS. Our executive officers do not reside in the United States. The U.S. stockholders would face difficulty in: · effecting service of process within the United States on our officers; · enforcing judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the officers; · enforcing judgments of U.S. courts based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws in foreign courts against our officers; and · bringing an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities based on the U.S. federal securities laws against our officers. WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: - have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; - provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; - comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); - submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and - disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation. 11 | Page In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. As an emerging growth company we have made the irrevocable election to not adopt the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 107(b), as added by Section 102(b), of the JOBS Act. This election allows companies to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES. The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company was formed on October 2, 2014, and has only a limited operating history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock. WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES. This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of $100,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan. 12 | Page THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY THE SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES. The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. OUR PRESIDENT, MR. SAVINSKII DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFERING AND SELLING SECURITIES , AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Mr. Savinskii does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us. DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between SavDen Group Corp. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment. 13 | Page WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from Denis Savinskii, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Savinskiis verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. OUR REPORTING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, MAY BE SUSPENDED AUTOMATICALLY IF WE HAVE FEWER THAN 300 SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE FIRST DAY OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. We will not register our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, we will not be subject to the Commissions proxy, tender offer, and short swing insider trading rules for Section 12 registrants and our obligation to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act will be automatically suspended if, on the first day of any fiscal year (other than a fiscal year in which a registration statement under the Securities Act has gone effective), we have fewer than 300 shareholders of record. This suspension is automatic and does not require any filing with the SEC. In such an event, we would only be required to file an annual report for the twelve months after this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC. Accordingly, we may cease providing periodic reports and current or periodic information, including operational and financial information, may not be available with respect to our results of operations. If our obligation to file reports under Section 15(d) is suspended it may decrease our common stocks liquidity, if any, affecting your ability to resell our common stock. THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 5,000,000 shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell the 5,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have 10,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the Dilution section below, the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. 14 | Page FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and best-efforts basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering.

The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Denis Savinskii, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Savinskiis verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Savinskii will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Savinskii. Mr. Savinskii will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation. 15 | Page DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. DILUTION Dilution represents the difference between the Offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder. The historical net tangible book value as of May 31, 2015 was negative $585 or approximately $0 per share. Historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of May 31, 2015. The following table sets forth as of May 31, 2015, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholders and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after deduction of offering expenses payable by us, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $0.02 per share of common stock.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 16 | Page We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. Our cash balance is $220 as of May 31, 2015. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Denis Savinskii, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of May 31, 2015, Mr. Savinskii has advanced to us $805. Mr. Savinskii, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $42,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at Griegstrasse, 9  Nesonova, Stuttgart, Germany 70195. Our phone number is +44 20 8133 4952. We are a development stage company and we have generated no revenue to date. Our full business plan entails activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our Plan of Operation below to maintain a reporting status. 17 | Page Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $100,000 from this offering, we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year, and would have to obtain additional funding. PLAN OF OPERATION We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 2, 2014. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. We are a development stage company that has not generated any revenue and just recently started our operations. If we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering. We intend to provide a business planning service (software) mainly aimed at at medium-sized and small companies in order to help them to develop their businesses or make presentations of their businesses to investors. We plan to offer a multilingual online computing platform in a form of a web site and a cloud based webstorage with pay per use system as a service. The services are going to be delivered without the cost and and complexity of buying and managing software, providing all of the facilities required to support the complete cycle of building and delivering business plans. Our offerings may include team collaboration within a particular business plan, converting business plans to different document formats (such as clear PDF files), sharing business plans, security of data and data storage. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in developing our marketable product. We intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop software. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees. Our plan of operations is as follows: Complete Our Public Offering We expect to complete our public offering within 180 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may fail. Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows: 18 | Page Office Establishment (1st-3d months) Range of Costs: $2,000-4,000 We require the necessary equipment to continue our operations. We plan to purchase office equipment such as telephone, fax, multifunction printer and furniture. We believe that it will cost us at least $2,000 to set up office and obtain the necessary equipment and stationery to continue operations. If we sell 50% of the shares offered we plan to buy office equipment and it will cost us minimum $2,000. In case we sell 75% of the shares offered we intend to buy better equipment with advanced features that will cost us approximately $3,000. In the event we sell all of the shares offered we plan to buy additional and more advanced equipment that will help us in everyday operations; therefore the office set up cots will be approximately $4,000. Equipment and Software ( 4th-6th months) Range of Costs: $7,000-15,000 We intend to purchase the professional equipment and software to create our business planning software. We plan to purchase PCs running different operating systems, as our goal is to provide all customers with equal features and functions of our web service regardless what kind of device they use. Another object of expenditure is buying software to build, design, develop and maintain our website. For the stage of building and developing software like JavaScript and Python is needed. To produce visual design answering our requirements we might need Adobe Photoshop CC, Adobe Illustrator CC (or CorelDRAW as a substitute). We plan to buy advanced licenses for multiple workstations in order to support business growth and development. In addition, to build mobile applications Swift and Android software is required. Establish a server/ rent a server from a company providing these feature. We intend to spend $7,000 minimum for the equipment and in case we sell 75% and 100% of the shares we will buy better equipment and software with advanced features. It will cost us about $10,000 and $15,000 accordingly. Software Development and Website Development ( 1st-12th months) Range of Costs: $5,000-12,000 We intend to develop our software and to research all its opportunitiesv and features during the all period of programming, development and testing. We plan to create website and application with using different software platforms. We are going to develop programming code and order the webdesign for specific templates. Our director will be responsible for programming. We plan to spend minimum $5,000 in case we sell 50% of the shares offered. If we sell 75% and 100% of the shares offered we plan to buy additional software and web tools for $8,000 and $12,000 accordingly. As of the date of this prospectus we have not yet identified or registered any domain names for our website. We also intend to build a landing page to draw potential clients attention to our service. Marketing Campaign ( 6th-12th months) Range of Costs: $8,000-26,000 We plan to use online marketing, direct sales, and presentations as the marketing instruments. We intend to use marketing strategies, such as web advertisements, social communities marketing, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We plan to conduct an active marketing campaign to promote our software. We plan to build a landing page to draw potential clients attention to our service. We are going to place web-banners on the web-sites devoted to business planning, marketing, commerce as well as on the sites devoted to software. Pay for Google contextual advertising, so the link to our website will pop-up whenever a user searches information related to business planning or business planning software. YouTube ads played before a video related to business consulting, business planning and strategy. Paying for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to advance to the first lines of the search results in the Internet queries of different search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, Aol and similar ones. Taking part at the exhibitions both of business and IT nature to draw attention of potential clients to our product and services. Create and maintain Facebook, Twitter and Google+ pages to provide customers with information updates concerning the service. We believe that the key marketing strategy for our type of business is online marketing. We intend to spent $8,000 minimum in case we sell 50% of the shares offered and we plan to spend money particularly on Search engine optimization (SEO). If we sell 75% and 100% of the shares offered we need $16,000 and $26,000 accordingly. We believe that our marketing campaign will help us to sell our product and we intend to reach first revenue. 19 | Page Staff Recruiting (8th-12th months) Range of Costs: $10,000-25,000 We plan to hire an experienced salesperson to advertise our services, building a network of clients, executing agreements and contracts with them. In case we sell 50% of the shares offered we intend to hire minimum one salesperson that will be responsible for our sales and finding new clients for our company. Our sole director Mr. Savinskii will be responsible for programming but in case we sell 75% and 100% of the shares we plan to hire additional salespersons and IT professionals and designers to build and design our website and applcation as well as to maintain and develop so we would be able to deliver services on different operating systems (MacOS, iOS, Win, WinMobile, Android). Estimated Expenses for the Next Twelve Month Period The following provides an overview of our estimated expenses to fund our plan of operation over the next twelve months. Description If 50% shares sold If 75% shares sold If 100% shares sold Fees Fees Fees Gross proceeds 50,000 75,000 100,000 Offering expenses 8,000 8,000 8,000 Net proceeds 42,000 67,000 92,000 Office Establishment 2,000 3,000 4,000 Equipment and Software 7,000 10,000 15,000 Software and Website Development 5,000 8,000 12,000 Marketing Campaign 8,000 16,000 26,000 Staff Recruiting 10,000 20,000 25,000 SEC reporting and compliance 10,000 10,000 10,000 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder. 20 | Page Results of operations From Inception on October 2, 2014 to May 31, 2015 During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan. Our loss since inception is $585. We have just recently started our business operations, however, will not start significant operations until we have completed this offering. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of May 31, 2015, the Company had $220 cash and our liabilities were $805, comprising $805 owed to Denis Savinskii, our sole officer and director. As of May 31, 2015 our cash balance was $220. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. Since inception, we have sold 5,000,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $5,000. We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations. We will have to utilize funds from Denis Savinskii, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process if offering proceeds are less than registration costs. However, Mr. Savinskii has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Mr. Savinskiis verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $42,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000. The Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations. Should the Company fail to raise a minimum of $42,000 under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations. 21 | Page DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Main Idea Our primary services are going to be as follows, business planning and business strategy. We intend to provide a business planning service mainly aimed at at medium-sized and small companies in order to help them to develop their businesses or make presentations of their businesses to investors. Our company will offer several advantages over similar services. We plan to offer a multilingual online computing platform in a form of a web site and a cloud based webstorage with pay per use system as a service. The services are going to be delivered without the cost and and complexity of buying and managing software, providing all of the facilities required to support the complete cycle of building and delivering business plans.

Our principal office address is located at Griegstrasse, 9  Nesonova, Stuttgart, Germany 70195. Our telephone number is +44 20 8133 4952. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding. Business Model To experience all the advantages of our services consumers will only need a connection to the Internet as our services are going to be provided online, without any additional software to be installed on a consumer's computer. Thus, a particular consumer will get accesses to their business plans and our services being at any place with the Internet connection provided. Our services are planned to be as follows, providing consumers with fully customizable business plan templates (aimed at those who lack skills in business planning), as well as providing video tutorials explaining every step. All business plans will have an option to be edited, stored in our cloud storage, converted to supported document formats (such as PDF) and then shared via email or downloaded. To make their business plans more illustrative the consumers may use an option to generate automatic charts and use data of similar plans to see how they score in the industry. For an additional fee the consumers might get the following services: document editing features (such as splitting into paragraphs or changing fonts for comfort reading, inserting texts or pictures from various sources including online ones); auto-write feature (to create a quick and simple description of business based on the information provided by the user); a ratios generated, explained and compared to the average in their industry; ability to collaborate in team over a particular business plan, online in real-time mode, choosing the corresponding option, and sharing a web link to their document on our platform. We have in mind the possibility to build an application for mobile devices with the same functions as the online service to let the consumers access, edit and share their business plans on the go. We lay account with acquiring more clients after promoting our mobile application in both AppStore and Google Play markets. As our technology is further developed and completed, we will determine the prices based upon costs and the prices of the competing products. We plan to to shoot and edit video tutorials explaining how to use our web site. We are going to promote our web service online by placing it to the first lines of search results of the following search engines - Google, Bing, Yahoo, Aol, and similar ones. We consider offering our customers a section with books related to marketing, planning and business strategy.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided.

Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering. There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application, that there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf, and that even if an application is filed, there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation.

This is a self-underwritten offering, and Mr. Savinskii, our sole officer and director, will sell the shares directly to family, friends, business associates and acquaintances, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares they may sell. There are no plans or arrangements to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Savinskii will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions, as noted herein, under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuers securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer: 1. Our sole officer and director is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and, 2. Our sole officer and director will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and 3. Our sole officer and director is not, nor will he be at the time of his participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and 4. Our sole officer and director meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that he (A) primarily perform, or intend primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) he is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). Under Paragraph 3a4-1(a)(4)(iii), our sole officer and director must restricts his participation to any one or more of the following activities: A. Preparing any written communication or delivering such communication through the mails or other means that does not involve oral solicitation by his of a potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such communication is approved by our sole officer and director; B.

Performing ministerial and clerical work involved in effecting any transaction. 28 | Page Our sole officer and director does not intend to purchase any shares in this offering. This offering is self-underwritten, which means that it does not involve the participation of an underwriter or broker, and as a result, no broker for the sale of our securities will be used. In the event a broker-dealer is retained by us to participate in the offering, we must file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to disclose the arrangements with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer will be acting as an underwriter and will be so named in the prospectus. Additionally, FINRA must approve the terms of the underwriting compensation before the broker-dealer may participate in the offering. To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction. We are subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and a distribution participant under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock. All expenses of the registration statement including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees are and will be borne by us. Penny Stock Regulations You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. Procedures for Subscribing If you decide to subscribe for any shares in this offering, you must - execute and deliver a subscription agreement; and - deliver a check or certified funds to us for acceptance or rejection. All checks for subscriptions must be made payable to SavDen Group Corp. The Company will deliver stock certificates attributable to shares of common stock purchased directly to the purchasers. 29 | Page Right to Reject Subscriptions We have the right to accept or reject subscriptions in whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason. All monies from rejected subscriptions will be returned immediately by us to the subscriber, without interest or deductions. Subscriptions for securities will be accepted or rejected with letter by mail within 48 hours after we receive them.

The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

(the Company) as of May 31, 2015 and the related statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company, at May 31, 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(the Company) is a for profit corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada, United States of America on October 2, 2014. Since inception the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business. While operations have not commenced, the Company has generated expenses and no revenue from the limited efforts. The Companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the companys business plan. The Company has adopted a May 31fiscal year end. Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Financial Statements and related disclosures as of May 31, 2015 are audited pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to Savden Group Corp., we, us, our or the company are to Savden Group Corp. NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN The Companys financial statements as of May 31, 2015 have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (October 2, 2014) through May 31, 2015 of $585. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At May 31, 2015 the Companys bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts. F-6 6 | Page Earnings per Share The Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45 Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are equal. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company will recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, Revenue Recognition ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required. Fair value of financial instruments ASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Any fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of May 31, 2015. Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718 Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to an Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the estimated fair values. Recently Issued Accounting Principles The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flow. F-7 7 | Page NOTE 4  LEGAL MATTERS The Company has no known legal issues pending. NOTE 6  CAPTIAL STOCK The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share. The Company has not issued any capital stock as of May 31, 2015. NOTE 7  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note. Since October 2, 2014 (Inception) through May 31, 2015, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $805 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. As of May 31, 2015, the amount outstanding was $805. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. NOTE 8  INCOME TAX The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. There are no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. NOTE 9  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company has evaluated events subsequent to the date these financial statements have been issued to assess the need for potential recognition or disclosure in this report. Such events were evaluated through the date these financial statements were available to be issued and determined that there are no material events to disclose.
