THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THE HEADING “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING ON PAGE 3. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Date of This Prospectus Is: April 23, 2008 2 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Please note that throughout this prospectus, the words “we”, “our” or “us” refer to the Company and not to the selling stockholders. WE WILL REQUIRE FINANCING TO ACHIEVE OUR CURRENT BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INABILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING COULD PROHIBIT US FROM EXECUTING OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND CAUSE US TO SLOW DOWN OUR EXPANSION OF OPERATIONS. We may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or sale of equity to achieve our current business strategy. Such financing may not be available when needed. Even if such financing is available, it may be on terms that are materially adverse to your interests with respect to dilution of book value, dividend preferences, liquidation preferences, or other terms. Our capital requirements to implement our business strategy will be significant. Moreover, in addition to monies needed to continue operations over the next twelve months, we anticipate requiring additional funds in order to significantly expand our operations and acquire the operating entities as set forth in our plan of operations. No assurance can be given that such funds will be available or, if available, will be on commercially reasonable terms satisfactory to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing if and when it is needed on terms we deem acceptable. If we are unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms, we could be forced to delay or scale back our plans for expansion. In addition, such inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON THE PERFORMANCE AND CONTINUED SERVICE OF GEORGE M. SFEIR, OUR ONLY OFFICER. WITHOUT HIS CONTINUED SERVICE, WE MAY BE FORCED TO INTERRUPT OR EVENTUALLY CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. We are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of George M. Sfeir our only officer. We currently do not have an employment agreement with either Mr. Sfeir. The loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. WE ARE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET AND WE ARE UNSURE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE ANY CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. Some of our competitors are much larger and better capitalized than we are. It may be that our competitors will better address the same market opportunities that we are addressing. These competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing business models that are more effective or have greater market success than our own. The Company is especially susceptible to larger manufacturers that invest more money in research and development. Moreover, the market for our products is large but highly competitive. There is little or no hard data that substantiates the demand for our products or how this demand will be segmented. It is possible that there will be low consumer demand for our products, or that interest in our products could decline or die out, which would cause us to be unable to sustain our operations. WHILE NO CURRENT LAWSUITS ARE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT A CLAIM OF SOME KIND MAY BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. While no current lawsuits are filed against the Company, the possibility exists that a claim of some kind may be made in the future. While we will work to insure high product quality and accuracy in all marketing and labeling, no assurance can be given that some claims for damages will not arise. While we plan to properly insure ourselves with standard product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate to cover litigation expenses and any awards to plaintiffs. THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOY OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS HEAVILTY DEPENDENT UPON UNITED STATES’ ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. The ability to successfully deploy our business model is heavily dependent upon the general state of the US economy. We cannot assure you that favorable conditions will exist in the future. A general economic recession in the United States or a downturn in the oil and gas industry could have a serious adverse economic impact on us and our ability to obtain funding and generate projected revenues. 3 Table of Contents THE OFFERING PRICE OF THE SHARES WAS ARBITRARILY DETERMINED, AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN INDICATOR OF THE FUTURE MARKET PRICE OF THE SECURITIES. THEREFORE, THE OFFERING PRICE BEARS NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE COMPANY, AND MAY MAKE OUR SHARES DIFFICULT TO SELL. Since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of $1.00 for the shares of common stock was arbitrarily determined. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. The offering price bears no relationship to the book value, assets or earnings of our company or any other recognized criteria of value. The offering price should not be regarded as an indicator of the future market price of the securities. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF A PUBLIC MARKET OR THAT THE COMMON STOCK WILL EVER TRADE ON A RECOGNIZED EXCHANGE. THEREFORE, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK. There is no established public trading market for our common stock. Our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved or that a regular trading market will develop or that if developed, will be sustained. In the absence of a trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment. OUR COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED A PENNY STOCK, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY, SO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES. If our common stock becomes tradable in the secondary market, we will be subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, which in all likelihood would make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their securities. Item 4. Use of Proceeds. USE OF PROCEEDS The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the shares for the selling security holders. Item 5. Determination of Offering Price DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE Since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of the shares of common stock was arbitrarily determined. The offering price was determined by the price shares were sold to our shareholders in our private placement which was completed in February 2008 pursuant to an exemption under Rule 506 of Regulation D. The offering price of the shares of our common stock has been determined arbitrarily by us and does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) concurrently with the filing of this prospectus. In order to be quoted on the Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. In addition, there is no assurance that our common stock will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the common stock in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity. Item 6. Dilution. DILUTION The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. 4 Table of Contents Item 7. Selling Security Holders. SELLING SHAREHOLDERS The shares being offered for resale by the selling stockholders consist of the 100,000 shares of our common stock held by 77 shareholders of our common stock which sold in our Regulation D Rule 506 offering completed in February 2008. The following table sets forth the name of the selling stockholders, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each of the selling stockholders as of April 23, 2008 and the number of shares of common stock being offered by the selling stockholders. The shares being offered hereby are being registered to permit public secondary trading, and the selling stockholders may offer all or part of the shares for resale from time to time. However, the selling stockholders are under no obligation to sell all or any portion of such shares nor are the selling stockholders obligated to sell any shares immediately upon effectiveness of this prospectus. All information with respect to share ownership has been furnished by the selling stockholders.

Plan of Distribution. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The selling security holders may sell some or all of their shares at a fixed price of $1.00 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. Prior to being quoted on the OTCBB, shareholders may sell their shares in private transactions to other individuals. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) concurrently with the filing of this prospectus. In order to be quoted on the Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. However, sales by selling security holder must be made at the fixed price of $1.00 until a market develops for the stock. Once a market has been developed for our common stock, the shares may be sold or distributed from time to time by the selling stockholders directly to one or more purchasers or through brokers or dealers who act solely as agents, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices, at negotiated prices or at fixed prices, which may be changed. The distribution of the shares may be effected in one or more of the following methods: O ordinary brokers transactions, which may include long or short sales, O transactions involving cross or block trades on any securities or market where our common stock is trading, market where our common stock is trading, O through direct sales to purchasers or sales effected through agents, O through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether exchange listed of otherwise), or exchange listed or otherwise), or O any combination of the foregoing. In addition, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers who may engage in short sales, if short sales were permitted, of shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers that require the delivery by such broker-dealers of the shares, which shares may be resold thereafter pursuant to this prospectus. Brokers, dealers, or agents participating in the distribution of the shares may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal, or both (which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer may be in excess of customary commissions). Neither the selling stockholders nor we can presently estimate the amount of such compensation. We know of no existing arrangements between the selling stockholders and any other stockholder, broker, dealer or agent relating to the sale or distribution of the shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of the selling security holders pursuant to this prospectus. We have agreed to bear the expenses of the registration of the shares, including legal and accounting fees, and such expenses are estimated to be approximately $20,000. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, no FINRA member will charge commissions that exceed 8% of the total proceeds of the offering. 7 Table of Contents Item 9.

Information with Respect to the Registrant. Organization Within Last Five Years We were incorporated in November 2006 in the State of Delaware and 125,000,000 shares each of common stock were issued to American Interest, LLC. Description of Business Technical Industries & Energy, Corp. (“TIE” or the “Company”) was founded in the State of Delaware on November 29, 2006; on January 3, 2007 we entered into a Stock Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement with Technical Industries, Inc., (“TII”) a Louisiana corporation whereby TII became our wholly owned subsidiary. Our business offices are located at Petroleum Towers, Suite 530 P.O. Box 52523, Lafayette, LA, 70505. Our telephone number is (337) 984-2000. TIE is headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana with a branch office and production facilities in Houston, Texas. TIE provides non-destructive testing (“NDT”) services for oilfield pipes and equipment. TII manufactures its own proprietary NDT electronic equipment systems, which perform the NDT services including ultrasonic inspection, electromagnetic inspection and others. TIE provides ultrasonic pipe inspection technology. Services include full-length electromagnetic inspection for oil-field pipe and equipment and full length ultrasonic inspection systems for new and used drill pipe, tubing, casing, and line-pipe. It is believed that TIE’s ultrasonic systems have the largest diameter Oilfield Country Tubular Diameter pipe full length ultrasonic capability (“OD”) inspection capabilities in the industry for seamless, ERW (Electric Resistant Welded), plain end and threaded pipe, and the deepest penetration capability offered for wall thickness and defects measurements. Today TIE continues to serve the oil industry niche by manufacturing and maintaining exceptional proprietary systems that are capable of detecting defects when others cannot. Recently Technical Industries, Inc. developed new US Patent No. 7,263,887 and international patent pending inspection technology needed in order to reach deep energy reserves present technology cannot reach. The new technology has been tested and used by major oil companies. Recently TIE formed an alliance with several national and international oil & gas pipe steel mills. This alliance enabled TIE to store, inspect, maintain, and custom engineer to the customers’ special specifications and deliver the pipe directly to the drilling site. This One-Stop-Shop concept provided enhanced convenience to our customers, saved the energy companies money, and increased TII revenues and profits.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Technical Industries & Energy, Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in retained earnings, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards as established by the Auditing Standards Board (United States) and in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Technical Industries & Energy, Corp. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. F-1 Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental information beginning on page 16 is presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. The supplemental information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. /s/ LaPorte, Sehrt, Romig Hand A Professional Accounting Corporation Metairie, Louisiana April 14, 2008 F-2 TECHNICAL INDUSTRIES & ENERGY, CORP.

F-7 TECHNICAL INDUSTRIES & ENERGY, CORP. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Organization Technical Industries & Energy, Corp. (the Company) was formed November 29, 2006 under the laws of the State of Delaware in order to acquire and to take over the assets and business of Technical Industries, Inc. (TII). On that date, the Company issued 125,000,000 shares of common stock to American Interest, LLC, in exchange for founder services rendered. The fair value of these services was considered immaterial, and no amounts were recognized in the financial statements. On January 3, 2007, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement and Share Exchange (the Agreement) whereby the sole shareholder of TII exchanged all of the outstanding shares of the TII to the Company in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of Company stock. Accordingly, TII became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at the carrying value to TII since TII and the Company were under common control prior to the acquisition. In accordance with SFAS No. 141 and APB Opinion No. 16, the financial statements have been restated as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2006. The number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2006, were restated to reflect the 50,000,000 shares exchanged for TII. TII specializes in the non-destructive testing of vessels, oilfield equipment and mainly pipe, including ultrasonic testing, utilizing the latest technologies. These technologies enable TII to (i) provide detailed information to customers regarding each pipe tested, and (ii) reach energy reserves present technology cannot reach without extra cost to the oil & gas companies. Because of the intense scrutiny applied to each section of pipe, TII is able to generate data which allows the pipe to be used in the most extreme conditions, and has been proven especially useful in deep water drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Note 2. Acquisition As disclosed in Note 1, on January 3, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Technical Industries, Inc, in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of $.001 par value common stock. The assets and liabilities assumed, which are summarized in the following paragraph, were recorded at the carrying value to TII since TII and the Company were under common control prior to the acquisition. A summary of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of TII is as follows: Assets Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 492,752 Receivables 570,801 Prepaid Expenses 42,555 Deferred Tax Asset 386,319 Property and Equipment, net 1,359,209 Capitalized Patent Costs 517,427 Other Assets 14,988 F-8 TECHNICAL INDUSTRIES & ENERGY, CORP.

Acquisition (Continued) Liabilities Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses (956,825 ) Notes Payable (47,113 ) Obligations under Capital Leases (10,832 ) Deferred Tax Liability (85,779 ) Amounts due to Affiliates (1,877,693 ) Since the Company and TII were under common control prior to the acquisition, the financial statements have been restated as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2006. The unaudited results of operations of the Company and TII for periods prior to the acquisition are summarized as follows: Net Sales Net Income Two days ended January 2, 2007 Company $ - $ - TII - - $ - $ - Year ended December 31, 2006 Company $ - $ - TII 2,609,890 369,117 $ 2,609,890 $ 369,117 Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Technical Industries, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Basis of Accounting Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recognized on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates due to information that becomes available subsequent to the issuance of the financial statements or for other reasons. F-9 TECHNICAL INDUSTRIES & ENERGY, CORP. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Trade Receivables Trade accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Trade credit is generally extended on a short-term basis; thus receivables do not bear interest, although a finance charge may be applied to amounts past due. Trade accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectibility based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition, and are charged against bad debt expense when they are deemed uncollectible. Use of this method does not result in a material difference from the valuation method required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for property and equipment and items that substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment disposed of are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation is provided utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets capitalized. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and trade receivables. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Company’s large number of customers. As presented in Note 4, two customers did make up 66% of revenue and 62% of receivables at December 31, 2007. The Company maintains cash accounts at several financial institutions. Cash balances at each institution are secured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $100,000. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deposits that exceeded the insured limit by $88,550. Advertising The Company charges the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. Advertising expense was $6,021 and $7,770 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Cash Flows For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. F-10 TECHNICAL INDUSTRIES & ENERGY, CORP. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation Number (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (as amended) . This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements . This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (as amended). This Statement improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This Statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. An employer with publicly traded equity securities shall initially apply the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 31, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (as amended) . This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to provide entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (an amendment of ARB No. 51) . This Statement was issued to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements. This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods with those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 31, 2008. F-11 TECHNICAL INDUSTRIES & ENERGY, CORP.

F-17 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section of the Registration Statement includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions. Plan of Operation TIE is well positioned for growth. TIE has the personnel and the infrastructure in place to facilitate expansion. Its blue-chip client base is growing in both number and size. With its new, patent-pending devices in place, the Company will be able to take advantage of the growing needs of clients for additional NDT services that competitors cannot provide. The following list highlights a few areas of opportunity to expand the Company's business: · Increased sales and marketing effort : TIE has grown over the historical period without an aggressive marketing and sales effort. Currently, new business is generated from referrals, technical sessions given by TIE to oil & gas and industry related companies, a website and through the use of a marketing company on a limited basis. To date, TIE has not hired any in-house salespersons. Management believes revenue can be increased substantially by expanding the Company's sales force. · Applying for additional patents to protect proprietary rights: TIE has recently developed international patent pending new inspection technology needed in order to reach deep energy reserves present technology cannot reach. The new technology has been tested and is presently used by major oil companies. Technical Industries, Inc. new expandable inspection technology recently helped BP and Baker Oil tools usefully drill the world’s first mono-bore oil & gas well. TIE’s expandable inspection technology helps the oil & gas companies retrieve a large amount of energy reserves that cannot be retrieved with current technology. TIE has manufactured several pieces of equipment in-house that have enabled the Company to successfully serve the oilfield market. Due to proprietary infringement risk, TIE has discontinued manufacturing the equipment for sale to third parties. By securing a patent protecting the Company's proprietary technology, TIE could consider manufacturing equipment for sale again, which would open a new line of revenue. · Introduction of complementary services : TIE is continually adding new services in order to meet customer demand. Most recently, TIE began drilling equipment inspection services. Other areas management has identified as potential growth avenues include vessel inspection and inspection of pipelines in service. TIE is working to acquire pipe threading equipment which could be attached to the inspection assembly line and provide additional service for a very low increased cost to our customers. Geographic expansion in the domestic and international markets: TIE currently derives the majority of revenue from the Houston, Texas market, where its clients are based. There are several other markets that could be better served, such as in Louisiana where a new plant in Abbeville Louisiana is presently under construction in order to serve the deep wells in the Gulf of Mexico. This plant is expected to be fully operational by October, 2008. Other expansions are being considered through the opening of additional full-service, local plants. Furthermore, the Company maintains relations with sales representatives in the Mexico and Saudi Arabia and the Middle East markets that could be better utilized if TIE was able to locally serve customers. Lastly, the Company has Canadian customers that utilize TIE's services on a limited basis, due to the high cost of shipping heavy pipes. To date, TIE has not had the capital or human resources to establish plants in these potential markets. TIE has been in discussions with three other businesses in an attempt to purchase these existing businesses. We continue to seek other companies which can compliment our pipe and inspection business with the goal of securing these businesses through a combination of cash and stock payments. All of these expansion plans rely heavily on raising capital through a public offering of additional stock which would be used to fund our acquisitions. The Company has a customer base of approximately 50 accounts, and is continually expanding its customer base to increase revenue growth. Currently, TIE serves customers that are major oil companies, steel mills, material suppliers, drilling companies, material rental companies and engineering companies. Customer relationships average over ten years and provide an 80% rate of repeat business. Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to year ended December 31, 2006 11 Table of Contents Revenues Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $4,041,494 compared to $2,609,890 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase of $1,431,604, or 54.85%, is attributable primarily to our patented and new technology which helps oil & gas companies reach energy reserves that present technology cannot reach. Our revenues were also positively affected due to our proprietary world wide accessible inventory tracking software which was implemented in 2006, as well as the overall 8.93% increase in 2007 in domestic oil and gas exploration. This tracking software enables our customers to track their inventory and projects, marketing and sales efforts from anywhere in the world via internet. The domestic drilling rig count was 951 rigs in 2006, compared to 1,036 rigs in 2007, an increase of 8.93%. The international offshore rig count in 2006 was 271 rigs compared to 291 rigs in 2007, an increase of 7.38%. The worldwide drilling rig count was 3,125 rigs in 2006 and 3,207 rigs for 2007, or an increase of 2.624% ( Source: Baker Hughes) . During 2007, we were awarded a patent from the Patent and Trademark Office of the United States for our pipe inspection process. We feel that this patent distinguishes us from our competition in regards to the level of service and assurance we can provide to our customers as to the pipe they utilize for drilling purposes. In addition, during 2007, we began selling Oil Country Tubular Goods to oil and gas companies to complement our pipe inspection services. The following table presents the composition of revenue in 2007 and 2006: Revenue: 2007 Dollars Percentage 2006 Dollars Percentage Variance Dollars Inspection Fees $ 3,541,112 87.6 % $ 2,452,194 94.0 % $ 1,088,918 Pipe Sales $ 291,354 7.2 % $ - - % $ 291,354 Other Income $ 209,028 5.2 % $ 157,696 6.0 % $ 51,332 Total Revenue $ 4,041,494 100.0 % $ 2,609,890 100.0 % $ 1,431,604 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit Our cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,876,310, or 46.4% of revenues, compared to $1,135,632, or 43.5% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Cost of revenues, as a percentage of revenues, increased by approximately 2.9% which reflects the effect of increases in labor costs and materials and supplies associated with the products and services that we provide. As was noted in the Revenues section, we have obtained agreements with three oilfield pipe steel mills, (one a U.S. National, one European, and the third a Chinese mill) and began selling OCTG (Oil Country Tubular) Exploration and drilling pipe including the new data provided by our patent technology to our oil and gas customers to complement our pipe inspection services. Since this was a new aspect to our business, the margins with these sales were relatively small. We anticipate that as this portion of our business grows, our margins will improve and enhance our overall profitability. The following table presents the composition of cost of revenue in 2007 and 2006: Cost of Revenue: 2007 Dollars Percentage 2006 Dollars Percentage Variance Dollars Labor and Related Costs $ 827,067 44.1 % $ 685,153 60.3 % $ 141,914 Materials and Supplies 375,888 20.0 % 86,231 7.6 % 289,657 Subcontract Labor 375,708 20.0 % 171,821 15.1 % 203,887 Maintenance 94,172 5.0 % 39,776 3.5 % 54,396 Insurance 81,071 4.3 % 69,484 6.1 % 11,587 Other 122,404 6.6 % 83,167 7.3 % 39,237 Total Cost of Revenue $ 1,876,310 100.0 % $ 1,135,632 100.0 % $ 740,678 In order to keep up with the demand for our services, additional technical personnel were hired during 2007. Due to limitations with the pool of qualified individuals, we utilized the services of subcontractors to assist us in providing timely and quality service to our customers. We will continue our efforts to attract, employ and retain qualified individuals to serve the needs of our customers. Included in the amount for Materials and Supplies for 2007 is the cost of pipe sold of approximately $267,000. This was a new aspect of our business for 2007 which we hope will continue to grow in the future. Our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2,165,184, or 53.6% of revenues, as compared to $1,474,258, or 56.5% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in gross profits of $690,926 is attributable primarily to the overall growth in revenues of $1,431,000 previously described, partially reduced by increases in our overall cost of revenue. 12 Table of Contents We expect that going forward our revenues will continue to increase while gross profit margins will tend to either remain constant or decrease slightly by expanding our operations and build new facilities wherever they are needed in order to increase our market share. We began a joint venture with a major Chinese oilfield equipment company in order to add oilfield pipe threading to our existing facilities. We are also engaged in discussions to purchase several other oilfield related companies in order to gain larger market share. Operating Expenses For 2007, our operating expenses totaled $1,076,680, as compared to $773,420, representing an increase of $303,260, or 3.9%. The larges component of our operating expenses for 2007 consists of salaries and wages, and rent expense. Salaries and wages for general and administrative personnel was $215,754 for 2007 compared to $150,967 for 2006, an increase of $64,787, or 42.3%. During 2007, we hired an office manager for our headquarters in Lafayette, an in-house attorney to help manage our legal issues associated with the various contracts and business agreements we incur as part of our normal operations, and an accounting manager to improve our customer billing, collection, and vendor payment procedures. Rent expense totaled $207,955 for 2007 as compared to $189,847 for 2006, an increase of $18,108, or 9.5%. Rent expense for both 2007 and 2006 pertains primarily to our rental of office space for our headquarters in Lafayette as well as our rental of land and facilities for operating purposes. The increase is attributable to normal escalation provisions within our lease agreements. For 2007, other significant operating expenses consisted of professional services and bad debt expense. Professional services totaled $110,576 for 2007 compared to $55,402 in 2006, and increase of $55,174, or 99.6%. Professional services expense consists primarily of legal, accounting and auditing costs. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in legal costs we incurred during 2007 for general business advice and counsel. In addition, a frivolous claim involving the Company was resolved during 2007 at the cost of $5,000.00 to our company. We have hired in-house counsel to enable us to reduce our dependency on outside counsel for general legal issues that may impact our day to day operations. For 2007, we recognized $136,913 of bad debt expense, as compare to $0 in 2006. Our bad debt expense consists primarily of the write off of amounts due to us from a customer for storage service we provided to the customer. In addition, the Company has provided for an allowance for outstanding invoices due from another customer for which collection is questionable. As noted previously, we have hired additional personal to improve our billing and collection procedures. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense consists of interest income and interest expense, respectively. Interest income for 2007 amounted to $40,526, as compared to $19,342 for 2006, an increase of $21,184, or 109.5%. We maintain an investment account with a national financial institution. The investment account consists primarily of a high-yield money market account to which we are able to invest our excess cash. Interest expense totaled $135,051 for 2007, as compared to $123,248 for 2006, an increase of $11,803, or 9.6%. Interest expense pertains primarily to amounts due to affiliates as well as to our notes payable and capital leases with third parties. Interest expense associated with amounts due to affiliates totaled $130,025 and $116,009 for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Provision for income taxes For 2007, we reported income tax expense of $498,395, compared to $227,815 for 2006. The increase in tax expense is related to the increase in net income for 2007 compared to 2006, as well as the impact of tax rates for Louisiana and Texas. Capital Resources and Liquidity As of December 31, 2007 we had $437,997 in cash. We believe we can satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months with our current cash and expected revenues. However, completion of our plan of operation is subject to attaining adequate revenue. We cannot assure investors that adequate revenues will be generated. In the absence of our projected revenues, we may be unable to proceed with our plan of operations. Even without adequate revenues within the next twelve months, we still anticipate being able to continue with our present activities, but we may require financing to potentially achieve our profit, revenue, and growth goals. In the event we are not successful in reaching our initial revenue targets, additional funds may be required, and we may not be able to proceed with our business plan for the development and marketing of our core services. Should this occur, we would likely seek additional financing to support the continued operation of our business. We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. 13 Table of Contents CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting or financial disclosure matters.

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2006 and 125,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to American Interest, LLC (controlled by George M. Sfeir) for founder services rendered. These shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) and were issued to these individuals as founders shares. These shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a “public offering” as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of shares offered. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors. In addition, American Interest, LLC had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction. In January 2007 we entered into a Stock Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement with Technical Industries, Inc., a Louisiana Corporation, whereby we exchanged 50,000,000 shares of common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Technical Industries, Inc., Mr. George Sfeir as the sole shareholder of Technical Industries, Inc. is the holder of the 50,000,000 common shares. These shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a “public offering” as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of shares offered. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors. In addition, Mr. Sfeir had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction. In February 2008, we completed a Regulation D Rule 506 offering in which we sold 100,000 shares of common stock to 77 investors, at a price per share of $1.00 for an aggregate offering price of $100,000. The following sets forth the identity of the class of persons to whom we sold these shares and the amount of shares for each shareholder: Alaaeldin Abdelkader 2000 Abu Baker 1000 Alfred J.
