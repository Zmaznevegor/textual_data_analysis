SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED MAY 31, 2013 PROSPECTUS Station Casinos LLC $500,000,000 7.50% Senior Notes due 2021 The 7.50% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Notes") were issued in exchange for the 7.50% Senior Notes due 2021 originally issued on March 1, 2013 by Station Casinos LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Station", "Company", "us", "we", or "our"). The Notes were issued under the indenture dated as of March 1, 2013 among the Company, the Guarantors (as defined herein) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee. We are entitled to redeem some or all of the Notes at any time prior to March 1, 2016 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus a "make whole" premium set forth in this prospectus, plus accrued interest and unpaid interest, if any. We are also entitled to redeem some or all of the Notes on or after March 1, 2016 at the redemption prices set forth in this prospectus, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

The Notes and the guarantees of the Notes are our general senior unsecured obligations. The Notes and the related guarantees rank senior in right of payment to all our existing and future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and equally in right of payment with all our existing and future senior liabilities.

This summary may not contain all of the information that you should consider in determining whether to invest in the Notes. This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the section entitled "Risk Factors," our financial statements and the related notes and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations thereof included elsewhere or incorporated by reference into this prospectus, before making a decision to purchase the Notes. We acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Station Casinos, Inc. ("STN") in connection with STN's plan of reorganization that was consummated on June 17, 2011 (the "Effective Date") under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Chapter 11 Cases"). Unless otherwise noted, the terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Station Casinos LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods following the Effective Date and to STN and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as "Station") for periods prior to the Effective Date. The term "Issuer" refers only to Station Casinos LLC and the term "Guarantors" refers to our restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Notes. Our Company We are a premier gaming and entertainment company established in 1976 that develops and operates casino entertainment facilities. We currently own and operate nine major hotel/casino properties principally under the Station and Fiesta brands and seven smaller casino properties (three of which are 50% owned) in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. We also manage the Gun Lake Casino in Allegan County, Michigan and have a contract to manage the Graton Resort & Casino in Sonoma County, California, which commenced construction in June 2012 and is expected to open by the end of 2013. We also hold a majority ownership interest in Fertitta Interactive LLC ("Fertitta Interactive"), which launched its real money online gaming operations under the Ultimate Gaming brand on April 30, 2013. We have made a significant investment in Fertitta Interactive and we expect that we will continue to make significant capital contributions to support its business strategy. We offer convenience and choices to residents throughout the Las Vegas valley with our strategically located portfolio of properties. Each of our properties caters primarily to Las Vegas area residents. We believe that our out-of-town patrons are also discerning customers who enjoy a high-quality, value oriented experience. We believe that our patrons view our hotel and casino product as a preferable alternative to attractions located on the Las Vegas Strip and in downtown Las Vegas. Our principal source of revenue and operating income is gaming, primarily slot revenue, and we use our non-gaming amenities to attract customer traffic to our casino properties. The majority of our revenue is cash-based and as a result, fluctuations in our revenues have a direct impact on our cash flows from operations. Because our business is capital intensive, we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future growth. We believe the high-quality entertainment experience we provide our customers also differentiates us from our competitors. Our casino properties are conveniently located throughout the Las Vegas valley and provide our customers a wide variety of entertainment and dining options. We believe we surpass our competitors in offering casino patrons the newest and most popular slot and video games featuring the latest technology. 1 Table of Contents Our Properties Set forth below is certain information as of March 31, 2013 concerning our properties, each of which is more fully described following the table.

Graton Resort & Casino. On April 22, 2003, STN entered into development and management agreements with the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria ("FIGR"), a federally recognized Native American tribe. Pursuant to those agreements, we are assisting the FIGR in developing a gaming and entertainment project located in Sonoma County, California, and will assist the FIGR in operating the project upon completion. As currently contemplated, the project will have a total of approximately 320,000 square feet of space, of which approximately 150,000 square feet will be casino, and the remainder of which will be non-casino space, which will include multiple bars, a food court and various dining options. Construction of the casino commenced in June 2012, and we expect that the project will commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. As of March 31, 2013, construction is on schedule and within the allotted construction budget. There can be no assurance, however, that the project will be constructed and opened within this time frame. The management agreement has a term of seven years from the date of opening of the project and we will receive a management fee equal to 24% of the facility's net income in years 1 through 4 and 27% of the facility's net income in years 5 through 7. We will also receive a development fee equal to 2% of the cost of the project upon the opening of the project. The National Indian Gaming Commission (the "NIGC") has approved the management agreement for Class II and Class III gaming at the planned facility. At March 31, 2013, the remaining amounts due from the FIGR total $59.0 million, which we will recognize in income as collected. 6 Table of Contents Fertitta Interactive Investment In November 2012, we acquired a majority ownership interest in Fertitta Interactive.

Our Business Strategy Our primary operating strategy emphasizes attracting and retaining customers who are primarily Las Vegas residents and, to a lesser extent, out-of-town visitors. Our properties attract customers through:  convenient locations;  offering our customers the latest in slot and video poker technology;  focused marketing efforts targeting our extensive customer database;  innovative, frequent and high-profile promotional programs; and  development of strong relationships with specifically targeted travel wholesalers in addition to convention business. The Las Vegas market is very competitive, and we compete with both large hotel casinos in Las Vegas and smaller gaming-only establishments through the Las Vegas valley. Provide a High-Value Gaming and Entertainment Experience. Because we target repeat customers, we are committed to providing a high-value entertainment experience for our customers in restaurants, hotels, casinos and other entertainment amenities. We have developed regional entertainment destinations for Las Vegas residents that include other amenities such as spas, movie theaters, bowling centers, ice skating, live entertainment venues and child care facilities. We believe the value offered by the restaurants at each of our casino properties is a major factor in attracting gaming customers, as dining is a primary motivation for casino visits by many guests. Through their restaurants, each of which has a distinct style of cuisine, our casino properties offer generous portions of high-quality food at reasonable prices. Our operating strategy focuses on slot and video poker machine play. Our target market consists of frequent gaming patrons who seek a friendly atmosphere and convenience. Because repeat visitors demand variety and quality in their slot and video poker machine play, we offer the latest in slot and video poker technology at our casino properties. As part of our commitment to providing a quality entertainment experience for our patrons, we are dedicated to ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty by providing attentive customer service in a friendly, casual atmosphere. Innovative Marketing and Promotion Strategy. We employ an innovative marketing strategy that utilizes frequent high-profile promotional programs in order to attract customers and establish a high level of name recognition. In addition to advertising through television, radio and newspaper, we have created and sponsored promotions that have become a tradition in the Las Vegas valley, such as our Jumbo Brand products and our annual Great Giveaway promotion. Our Boarding Pass player rewards program allows guests to earn points based on their level of gaming activity. Participants in the program can redeem points at any of our Las Vegas-area properties for cash, complimentary slot play, food, beverages, meals in any of the restaurants, hotel rooms, movie passes, entertainment tickets and merchandise. 7 Table of Contents We are heavily focused on using cutting-edge technology to drive customer traffic with products created by us, such as our Jumbo Brand products, which include "Jumbo Pennies," "Jumbo Bingo," "Jumbo Keno" and "Jumbo Hold'Em." Other products include "Xtra Play Cash" and "Sports Connection," among others. We believe that these products create sustainable competitive advantages and will continue to distinguish us from our competition. Employee Relations. Station began as a family-run business in 1976 and has maintained close-knit relationships amongst its management, and endeavors to instill this same sense of loyalty among our employees. Toward this end, we take a hands-on approach through active and direct involvement with employees at all levels. We believe we have very good employee relations. See "Risk FactorsRisks Related to our BusinessUnion organization activities could disrupt our business by discouraging patrons from visiting our properties, causing labor disputes or work stoppages, and, if successful, could significantly increase our labor costs." Refinancing Transactions In March 2013, we undertook a series of transactions to refinance our outstanding indebtedness. We used the net proceeds from the Notes offering together with borrowings under our new $1,625.0 million term loan and $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the "New Credit Facility") and cash on hand, to (i) purchase or otherwise redeem all of our outstanding Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Old Notes"), (ii) repay all amounts outstanding under our $931.3 million senior secured credit facility (the "Propco Credit Agreement"), (iii) repay all amounts outstanding under the $575.0 million credit facility under which our subsidiaries NP Opco LLC ("Opco") and Station GVR Acquisition, LLC ("GVR") were borrowers (the "Opco/GVR Credit Agreement"), and (iv) pay fees and costs associated with such refinancings.

You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained under "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and elsewhere in this prospectus before purchasing the Notes. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus cause the value of the Notes to decline. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in the Notes. Risks Related to our Business We depend on the Las Vegas locals and repeat visitor markets as our key markets, which subjects us to greater risks than a gaming company with more diverse operations. Our operating strategies emphasize attracting and retaining customers from the Las Vegas local and repeat visitor market. All of our owned casino properties are dependent upon attracting Las Vegas residents. As a result of our concentration in the Las Vegas market, we have a greater degree of exposure to a number of risks than we would have if we had operations outside of the Las Vegas valley. These risks include the following:  local economic and competitive conditions;  changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;  natural and other disasters; and  a decline in the local population. In addition, our strategy of growth through master-planning of our casinos for future expansion, was developed, in part, based on projected population growth in Las Vegas. As a result of the severe economic downturn, the Las Vegas valley has not experienced population growth at expected rates or at the same rates as it experienced prior to the economic downturn. There can be no assurance that population growth in Las Vegas will return to levels that justify future development, additional casinos or expansion of our existing casino properties, which limits our ability to expand our business. Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy. Consumer demand for the offerings of casino hotel properties such as ours is sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions and customer confidence in the economy, unemployment, the uncertainty and distress in the housing and credit markets, the impact of high energy and food costs, the potential for bank failures, perceived or actual changes in disposable consumer income and wealth, effects or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The economic downturn has adversely affected us, and may continue to adversely affect consumer spending at our gaming properties and our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 15 Table of Contents The economic downturn adversely impacted our business. Adverse economic conditions and declines in consumer confidence may negatively impact our revenues and other operating results in the future. Our casinos draw a substantial number of customers from the Las Vegas valley, as well as certain geographic areas, including Southern California, Arizona and Utah. The economies of these areas have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted due to a number of factors, including unemployment, weak real estate values and decreased consumer confidence levels. The economic downturn and adverse conditions in these areas and in the United States generally has resulted in a significant decline in spending in Las Vegas, which has negatively affected our results of operations. Although our market has shown some signs of stabilization in recent periods, we cannot be sure that the market will continue to improve and continued adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations in the future. Based on information from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, gaming revenues in Clark County for the three months ended March 31, 2013 increased by 3.1% from the level in the prior year. However, Las Vegas gaming revenues and operators were severely impacted by the economic downturn and there can be no assurance that gaming revenues will not decrease in future periods. In addition, the overall economic outlook and residential real estate market in the United States, and in particular Las Vegas, remain uncertain, and Las Vegas and our other target markets continue to experience high rates of unemployment. All of these factors have materially and adversely affected our results of operations in the past and may do so in the future. Further declines in real estate values in Las Vegas and the United States and concerns about the credit and liquidity markets could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. Furthermore, other uncertainties, including national and global economic conditions, other global events, or terrorist attacks or disasters in or around Southern Nevada could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face substantial competition in the gaming industry and we expect that such competition will intensify. Our casino properties face competition from all other casinos and hotels in the Las Vegas area including, to some degree, from each other. In addition, our casino properties face competition from all smaller non-restricted gaming locations and restricted gaming locations (locations with 15 or fewer slot machines) in the greater Las Vegas area, including those that primarily target the local and repeat visitor markets. Major additions, expansions or enhancements of existing properties or the construction of new properties by competitors, could also have a material adverse effect on the business of our casino properties. If our competitors operate more successfully than we do or if they attract customers away from us as a result of aggressive pricing and promotion or enhanced or expanded properties, we may lose market share and our business could be adversely affected. To a lesser extent, our casino properties compete with gaming operations in other parts of the state of Nevada and other gaming markets in the United States and in other parts of the world, with state sponsored lotteries, on-and-off-track pari-mutuel wagering (a system of betting under which wagers are placed in a pool, management receives a fee from the pool, and the remainder of the pool is split among the winning wagers), card rooms, other forms of legalized gaming and online gaming. The gaming industry also includes dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, racetracks with slot machines and casinos located on Native American land. There is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry, some of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Our properties have encountered additional competition as large scale Native American gaming on Indian lands, particularly in California, has increased and we expect such competition will intensify as more Native American gaming facilities are developed. Several states are currently considering the approving of legalized casino gaming in designated areas, expansion of existing gaming operations or additional gaming sites. In addition, internet poker has been approved by the Nevada legislature and legislation approving internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. Internet gaming and 16 Table of Contents expansion of legalized casino gaming in new or existing jurisdictions and on Native American land will result in strong competition that could adversely affect our operations, particularly to the extent that such gaming is conducted in areas close to our operations. We are dependent upon Fertitta Entertainment, an entity controlled by Frank J. Fertitta III and Lorenzo J. Fertitta, to operate our casino properties pursuant to long term management contracts. The success of our operations depends on the ability of Fertitta Entertainment to effectively manage our assets and operations. Upon consummation of our restructuring, we entered into management agreements with subsidiaries of Fertitta Entertainment. The management agreements have scheduled terms of 25 years and have limited rights of termination. Pursuant to the management agreements, subsidiaries of Fertitta Entertainment have significant discretion in the management and operation of our casino properties. Fertitta Entertainment receives a base management fee equal to two percent of the gross revenues attributable to our properties and an incentive management fee equal to five percent of positive EBITDA of our properties. Subject to the terms of a non-competition agreement, Fertitta Entertainment or any of its affiliates is permitted to manage certain casinos and properties other than our properties. Accordingly, management of such other casinos and properties by Fertitta Entertainment may create conflicts of interest between the Company and members of management affiliated with Fertitta Entertainment. In addition, such other management opportunities could limit the ability of such members of our management to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our business. There can be no assurance that those potential time conflicts and conflicts of interest will be resolved in the Company's favor. In addition, Fertitta Entertainment or its affiliates were granted a perpetual license to use certain of our information technology systems (but not our customer database). Although this license is subject to certain limitations, it enables the licensee thereunder to make use of such information technology systems in connection with assets, entities and projects other than our casino business enterprise that are managed, owned or operated by Fertitta Entertainment or its affiliates. As a consequence of the foregoing, Fertitta Entertainment has the technological resources necessary to rapidly develop additional business opportunities other than the management of our casino business, which may give Fertitta Entertainment an incentive to focus meaningful attention on such business activities in addition to the management of our casino business. The success of our casino properties and, in turn, our business, is substantially dependent upon Fertitta Entertainment and its affiliates. Subject to limited restrictions, Fertitta Entertainment and its affiliates are permitted to manage the operations of other gaming companies and the officers and employees of Fertitta Entertainment and its affiliates are not required to devote their full time and attention to managing our casino properties. There can be no assurance that Fertitta Entertainment will be successful at managing and operating our casino properties or that the terms of the Fertitta Entertainment management agreements are in our best interests. We rely on key personnel of Fertitta Entertainment, the loss of the services of whom could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to operate successfully and competitively is dependent, in part, upon the continued services of certain officers and key employees, including but not limited to Frank J. Fertitta III. All but one of our executive officers are employees of Fertitta Entertainment. In the event that Fertitta Entertainment and its affiliates cease to manage our casino properties or these officers and/or employees leave Fertitta Entertainment, we might not be able to find suitable replacements. Through 17 Table of Contents termination of the management agreements, or by other means, we believe that the loss of the services of these officers and/or employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Union organization activities could disrupt our business by discouraging patrons from visiting our properties, causing labor disputes or work stoppages, and, if successful, could significantly increase our labor costs. None of our casino properties is currently subject to any collective bargaining agreement or similar arrangement with any union, and we believe we have excellent employee relations. However, union activists have actively sought to organize employees at certain of our casino properties in the past, and we believe that such efforts are ongoing at this time. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our casino properties will not ultimately be unionized. Union organization efforts that may occur in the future could cause disruptions to our casino properties and discourage patrons from visiting our properties and may cause us to incur significant costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, union activities may result in labor disputes, including work stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, should employees at one or more of our properties organize, collective bargaining would introduce an element of uncertainty into planning our future labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the business of our casino properties and our financial condition and results of operations. Work stoppages, labor problems and unexpected shutdowns may limit our operational flexibility and negatively impact our future profits. Any work stoppage at one or more of our casino properties, including any construction projects which may be undertaken, could require us to expend significant funds to hire replacement workers, and qualified replacement labor may not be available at reasonable costs, if at all. Strikes and work stoppages could also result in adverse media attention or otherwise discourage customers from visiting our casino properties. Strikes and work stoppages involving laborers at any construction project which may be undertaken could result in construction delays and increases in construction costs. As a result, a strike or other work stoppage at one of our casino properties or any construction project could have an adverse effect on the business of our casino properties and our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not experience a strike or work stoppage at one or more of our casino properties or any construction project in the future. In addition, any unexpected shutdown of one of our casino properties or any construction project could have an adverse effect on the business of our casino properties and our results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be adequately prepared for unexpected events, including political or regulatory actions, which may lead to a temporary or permanent shutdown of any of our casino properties. Potential conflicts of interest may exist or may arise among our principal equity holders. Our board of managers is controlled by persons designated by FI Station Investor LLC ("FI Station Investor"), an affiliate of Fertitta Entertainment, and German American Capital Corporation (an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.) ("GACC"). In addition, certain major actions require the approval of a majority of the managers designated by FI Station Investor and a majority of the managers designated by GACC. Affiliates of Fertitta Entertainment are indirect equity holders of the Company and the managers of our operations. In addition, all of our executive officers are employed by Fertitta Entertainment. The interests of FI Station Investor, in its capacity as an affiliate of the managers of our properties, may be different from, or in addition to, its interests as an equity holder. For example, since the affiliates of 18 Table of Contents Fertitta Entertainment that manage our operations are compensated for their management services based on the revenue and EBITDA achieved by our properties, FI Station Investor may have an incentive to support the growth of such revenue and EBITDA even if doing so would require increased leverage and interest service obligations or increased capital expenditures for our properties. Under certain circumstances, the imposition of increased leverage and interest service obligations on our properties, or an increase in our capital expenditure levels, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, GACC, which holds indirect non-voting equity interests in the Company and is entitled to designate members of our board of managers, is a lender under our New Credit Facility. To the extent that it continues to hold interests at multiple levels of the capital structure of the Company, it may have a conflict of interest and make decisions or take actions that reflect its interests as a secured lender, unsecured lender or indirect equity holder of the Company that could have adverse consequences to other stakeholders of the Company. We are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the states, counties and cities in which we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. For a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see "BusinessRegulation and Licensing." The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time. Increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results of operations. Changes to the gaming tax laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations by increasing the cost of operating our business. The gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenue, particularly to the State of Nevada and its counties and municipalities. From time to time, various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in taxes, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. The Nevada Legislature meets every two years for 120 days and when special sessions are called by the Governor. The current Nevada legislative session began on February 4, 2013. There have been no specific proposals during the legislative session to increase gaming taxes; however, there are no assurances an increase in gaming taxes or other taxes impacting gaming licensees or other businesses in general will not be proposed and passed by the Nevada Legislature in a future legislative session. An increase in the gaming tax or other such taxes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may incur losses that are not adequately covered by insurance, which may harm our results of operations. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future. Although we maintain insurance customary and appropriate for our business, each of our insurance policies is subject to certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding our facilities in 19 Table of Contents the event of a total loss. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured. In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, loss of income due to terrorism, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage and pollution, may not be covered under our policies. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. To the extent that the cost of insurance coverage increases, we may be required to reduce our policy limits or agree to exclusions from our coverage. We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business. An adverse determination with respect to any such disputed matter could result in substantial losses. We are, from time to time, during the ordinary course of operating our businesses, subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes, including contract, lease, employment and regulatory claims as well as claims made by visitors to our properties. In addition, there are litigation risks inherent in any construction or development of any of our properties. Certain litigation claims may not be covered entirely or at all by our insurance policies or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. In addition, litigation claims can be expensive to defend and may divert our attention from the operations of our businesses. Further, litigation involving visitors to our properties, even if without merit, can attract adverse media attention. As a result, litigation can have a material adverse effect on our businesses and, because we cannot predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that adverse judgments or settlements could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses. We may incur delays and budget overruns with respect to future construction projects. Any such delays or cost overruns may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We are currently managing the development of a gaming facility for the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria and providing funding for a proposed gaming facility for the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians (collectively, the "Native American Tribes"). We will evaluate expansion opportunities as they become available, and in the future we may develop projects in addition to the proposed facilities for the Native American Tribes. Construction projects, such as the proposed gaming facilities for the Native American Tribes, entail significant risks, including the following:  shortages of material or skilled labor;  unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems;  work stoppages;  weather interference;  floods; and  unanticipated cost increases, any of which can give rise to delays or cost overruns. 20 Table of Contents The anticipated costs and construction periods are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects and contractors. Construction, equipment, staffing requirements, problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits, allocations or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the construction or opening of each of the proposed facilities or otherwise affect the project's planned design and features. We cannot be sure that we will not exceed the budgeted costs of these projects or that the projects will commence operations within the contemplated time frame, if at all. Budget overruns and delays with respect to expansion and development projects could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We may regularly pursue new gaming acquisition and development opportunities and may not be able to recover our investment or successfully expand to additional locations. We will regularly evaluate and may pursue new gaming acquisition and development opportunities in existing and emerging jurisdictions. These opportunities may take the form of joint ventures. To the extent that we decide to pursue any new gaming acquisition or development opportunities, our ability to benefit from such investments will depend upon a number of factors including:  our ability to identify and acquire attractive acquisition opportunities and development sites;  our ability to secure required federal, state and local licenses, permits and approvals, which in some jurisdictions are limited in number;  certain political factors, such as local support or opposition to development of new gaming facilities or legalizing casino gaming in designated areas;  the availability of adequate financing on acceptable terms (including waivers of restrictions in existing credit arrangements); and  our ability to identify and develop satisfactory relationships with joint venture partners. Most of these factors are beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot be sure that we will be able to recover our investment in any new gaming development opportunities or acquired facilities, or successfully expand to additional locations. We have invested, and we will likely continue to invest, in real property in connection with the pursuit of expansion opportunities. These investments are subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of real property, including:  changes in economic conditions;  environmental risks;  governmental rules and fiscal policies; and  other circumstances over which we may have little or no control. The development of such properties will also be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facilities. We cannot be sure that we will be able to recover our investment in any such properties or be able to prevent incurring investment losses. Fertitta Interactive is a new business with a limited operating history. Our ability to recover our investment depends on the adoption of federal and state laws permitting online gaming and Fertitta Interactive's ability to compete effectively with other online gaming providers. Online gaming, from which Fertitta Interactive is expected to derive substantially all of its revenue, is a new and rapidly evolving industry. We made a significant investment in Fertitta Interactive when we purchased a majority interest from affiliates of Frank J. Fertitta III and Lorenzo J. Fertitta, and we 21 Table of Contents expect that we will continue to make significant capital contributions to Fertitta Interactive to enable it to pursue its business strategy. We cannot be sure that Fertitta Interactive will achieve profitability or that we will be able to recover our investment. The ability of Fertitta Interactive to pursue its business is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including the adoption of federal and state laws and regulations to facilitate widespread online gaming and consumer acceptance of real money online gaming. In October 2006, Congress enacted the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ("UIGEA"), which effectively prohibits interstate online gambling. However, a number of states have enacted or are considering enacting legislation authorizing intrastate online gaming. Although Nevada lawmakers have enacted such a legislative framework, the success of Fertitta Interactive is likely to depend on the expansion of online gaming beyond Nevada. We cannot predict whether, how and when other jurisdictions will pass legislation authorizing online gaming and UIGEA, until repealed or amended, effectively prohibits interstate online gaming. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that Fertitta Interactive will be able to acquire online gaming licenses beyond Nevada. If Fertitta Interactive is not able to acquire additional state licenses or fails to comply with new laws or regulations, our investment in Fertitta Interactive could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, Fertitta Interactive may encounter technical and operational challenges in establishing its online gaming platform and we expect that competition among online gaming providers will be intense. Other online gaming companies have technology and operating systems that are more established than Fertitta Interactive's systems as well as greater access to online gaming customers based on existing virtual gaming activities. As a result, even if legislation that permits widespread real money online gaming is enacted, we cannot be sure that Fertitta Interactive will be able to successfully operate its business or that we will recover our investment in Fertitta Interactive. We may experience difficulty integrating operations of any acquired companies and developed properties and managing our overall growth which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We may not be able to effectively manage our properties, the proposed projects with the Native American Tribes and any future acquired companies or developed properties, or realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, including streamlining operations or gaining efficiencies from the elimination of duplicative functions. The integration of other companies' assets will require continued dedication of management resources and may temporarily distract attention from our day-to-day business. In addition, to the extent we pursue expansion and acquisition opportunities, we face significant challenges not only in managing and integrating the Gun Lake facility and the proposed projects with the Native American Tribes, but also managing our expansion projects and any other gaming operations we may acquire in the future. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The bankruptcy filing negatively impacted our image and may continue to negatively impact our business going forward. As a result of the bankruptcy, we were the subject of negative publicity for several years which had an impact on our image. This negative publicity may have had an effect on the terms under which some customers and suppliers are willing to continue to do business with us, and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, future business prospects and results of operations. The impact of this negative publicity cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. 22 Table of Contents Conditions in the financial system and the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to raise capital to fund capital expenditures, pursue proposed development, expansion or acquisition opportunities or refinance our significant indebtedness. Our businesses are capital intensive. For our casino properties to remain attractive and competitive we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. Similarly, future construction and development projects, including but not limited to proposed gaming facilities for the Native American Tribes, and acquisitions of other gaming operations could require significant additional capital. We rely on earnings and cash flow from operations to finance our business, capital expenditures, development, expansion and acquisitions and, to the extent that we cannot fund such expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. We will also be required in the future to refinance our outstanding debt. Our ability to effectively operate and grow our business may be constrained if we are unable to borrow additional capital or refinance existing borrowings on reasonable terms. Events over the past several years, including the failures and near failures of financial services companies and the decrease in liquidity and available capital, have negatively affected the capital markets. If we do not have access to credit or capital markets at desirable times or at rates that we would consider acceptable, the lack of such funding could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to service our indebtedness. We may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our results of operations. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year or when a triggering event occurs, and we test other long-lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If we do not achieve our projected cash flow estimates related to such assets, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. We and STN have recognized significant impairment charges in the past as a result of a number of factors including negative industry and economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, and slower than expected growth. We could be required to recognize additional impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if events that negatively impact our business should occur in the future. Increases in energy prices may adversely affect our results of operations. Our casinos use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy. While no shortages of energy have been experienced, the substantial increase in the cost of electricity and gasoline in the United States has negatively affected our operating results in the past and may negatively affect our business in the future. Failure to maintain the integrity of our internal or customer data could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows, and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits. Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of data about our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners, including customer credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third party service providers. The integrity and protection of that data is important to our business and is subject to privacy laws enacted by various jurisdictions. The regulatory environment and the requirements imposed on us by the payment card industry surrounding information, security and privacy are evolving and may be inconsistent. Our systems may be unable to meet changing regulatory and payment card industry requirements and employee and 23 Table of Contents customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so. Our information systems and records, including those maintained by service providers, may be subject to security breaches, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. The steps we have taken to mitigate these risks may not be sufficient and a significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained by us or by a service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation and employee relationships and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation. A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. We may face potential successor liability for liabilities of STN not provided for in our plan of reorganization. If we are determined to be liable for obligations of STN, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We may be subject to certain liabilities of STN not provided for in our plan of reorganization. Such liabilities may arise in a number of circumstances, including those where:  a creditor of STN did not receive proper notice of the pendency of the bankruptcy case relating to our plan of reorganization or the deadline for filing claims therein;  the injury giving rise to, or source of, a creditor's claim did not manifest itself in time for the creditor to file the creditor's claim;  a creditor did not timely file the creditor's claim in such bankruptcy case due to excusable neglect;  we are liable for STN's tax liabilities under a federal and/or state theory of successor liability; or  the order of confirmation for our plan of reorganization was procured by fraud. To date, we have been successful in both state court and bankruptcy court defending against such alleged liabilities. If, however, we are determined to be subject to such liabilities, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We incurred operating losses in recent fiscal periods. Unless we are able to continue to improve the results of operations of the assets that we acquired in connection with our 2011 restructuring, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt obligations and finance all operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures. Although we generated operating income of $47.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and $149.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, STN incurred operating losses of $209.1 million, $1.2 billion and $3.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and we may incur operating losses in the future. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to service our debt obligations as they come due, finance capital expenditures and meet our operational needs. Any one of these failures may preclude us from, among other things:  maintaining or enhancing our properties;  taking advantage of future opportunities;  growing our business; or  responding to competitive pressures. Further, our failure to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows could lead to cash flow and working capital constraints, which may require us to seek additional working capital. We may not be able to obtain such working capital when it is required. Further, even if we were able to obtain 24 Table of Contents additional working capital, it may only be available on unfavorable terms. For example, we may be required to take on additional debt, and servicing the payments on such debt could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Limited liquidity and working capital may also restrict our ability to maintain and update our casinos properties, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage to casinos offering more modern and better maintained facilities. Risks Related to the Notes and our Substantial Indebtedness We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business. We have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant principal and interest payments. As of March 31, 2013, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness, including original issue discount, totaled approximately $2.3 billion, and we have $313.3 million of undrawn availability under our New Credit Facility. Our ability to make interest payments on our debt will be significantly impacted by general economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our substantial indebtedness could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and our senior secured credit facilities;  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings, including those under our senior secured credit facilities, are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;  place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;  limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and  increase our cost of borrowing. Despite our current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness. Incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of the documents governing our indebtedness restrict, but do not completely prohibit, us from doing so. As of March 31, 2013, we had $313.3 million of undrawn availability under our New Credit Facility (after giving effect to the issuance of approximately $36.7 million of letters of credit and similar obligations). In addition, the indenture governing the Notes allows us to issue additional Notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the Guarantors. The indenture also allows us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt. In addition, the indenture does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. 25 Table of Contents We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We will also be required to obtain the consent of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities to refinance material portions of our indebtedness, including the Notes. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Additionally, the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility and the indenture governing the Notes limits the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer. Upon a change of control, as defined under the indenture governing the Notes, the holders of Notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the Notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the Notes on reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding Notes or to purchase all validly tendered Notes would be an event of default under the indenture. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt. Our other debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture. In addition, in certain circumstances specified in the indenture governing the Notes, we are required to commence an asset sale offer, as defined in the indenture, pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase the applicable Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer. Our failure to purchase any such Notes when required under the indenture is an event of default under the indenture. Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of "substantially all" of our assets. The definition of change of control in the indenture governing the Notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of "all or substantially all" of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. 26 Table of Contents If we default under our New Credit Facility, we may not be able to service our debt obligations. In the event of a default under the credit agreement governing our New Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If such acceleration occurs, thereby permitting an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the Notes, we may not be able to repay the amounts due under such credit facilities or the Notes. This could have serious consequences to the holders of the Notes and to our financial condition and results of operations, and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. If default occurred under the credit facilities of one of our unrestricted subsidiaries, the subsidiary or subsidiaries party to such credit facility might have to take actions that could result in the diminution or elimination of our equity interest in such subsidiary. See "Description of Other Indebtedness." The Notes are not secured by our assets, or the assets of the Guarantors, and the lenders under our New Credit Facility will be entitled to remedies available to a secured creditor, which give them priority over you to collect amounts due to them. As of March 31, 2013, we and our restricted subsidiaries had approximately $2.2 billion of debt outstanding. The Notes and the related guarantees will not be secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of the Guarantors. In contrast, our obligations under the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and substantially all of the assets of the Guarantors. Because the Notes and the related guarantees will be unsecured obligations, your right of repayment may be compromised if any of the following situations occur:  we enter into a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or any other winding-up proceeding;  there is a default in payment under the credit agreement governing our New Credit Facility or our other secured indebtedness; or  there is an acceleration of any indebtedness under the credit agreement governing our New Credit Facility or our other secured indebtedness. If any of these events occurs, the secured lenders could sell those of our and our Guarantors' assets in which they have been granted a security interest, to your exclusion, even if an event of default exists under the indenture governing the Notes at such time. Only when our obligations under the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility are satisfied in full will the proceeds of the collateral securing our obligations under the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility be available, subject to other permitted liens, to satisfy obligations under the Notes and guarantees. As a result, upon the occurrence of any of these events, there may not be sufficient funds to pay amounts due on the Notes and the guarantees. The indenture governing the Notes and the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities. The credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility and the indenture governing the Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:  incur additional debt or issue certain preferred units;  pay dividends on or make certain redemptions, repurchases or distributions in respect of our Units or make other restricted payments; 27 Table of Contents  make certain investments;  sell certain assets;  create liens on certain assets;  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. In addition, the credit agreement governing the revolving portion of the New Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility, indenture governing the Notes or other indebtedness that we may incur in the future could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility, the lenders thereunder:  will not be required to lend any additional amount to us;  could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend future credit; or  could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or to pay our debts, the lenders under the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our assets, and the holders of the Notes would be entitled to exercise remedies under our indenture. If our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. Moreover, in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms, or at all. You should read the discussions under the headings "Description of Other Indebtedness" and "Description of the NotesCertain Covenants" for further information about these covenants. Because each Guarantor's liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors. You have the benefit of the guarantees of the subsidiary Guarantors. However, the guarantees by the subsidiary Guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the subsidiary Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a subsidiary Guarantor's liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other obligations of such subsidiary Guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully below, a court under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the Guarantor. See "Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and our Substantial IndebtednessU.S. federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the guarantees and require note holders to return payments received from the Guarantors." In addition, you will lose the benefit 28 Table of Contents of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under "Description of the NotesBrief Description of the Notes and the GuaranteesThe Guarantees." Unrestricted subsidiaries are not, and those that we may form in the future generally will not be, subject to any of the covenants in the indenture and will not guarantee the Notes or pledge any collateral to secure the Notes, and we may not be able to rely on the cash flow or assets of those entities to pay our indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our existing or future unrestricted subsidiaries that are not Guarantors of the Notes. As of the date of this prospectus, our unrestricted subsidiaries include NP Landco Holdco LLC and SC Interactive Investor LLC and each of their respective subsidiaries. We will be permitted to designate other subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and make significant investments in entities that will not be subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing the Notes. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture governing the Notes, such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture. In addition, the creditors of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries. In addition, unrestricted subsidiaries and entities that are not subsidiaries will generally not be subject to the covenants under the indenture governing the Notes. Unrestricted subsidiaries and entities that are not subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that limit their ability to make loans or other payments to fund payments in respect of the Notes. Accordingly, we may not be able to rely on the cash flow or assets of those entities to pay any of our indebtedness, including the Notes. U.S. federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the guarantees and require note holders to return payments received from the Guarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under the Notes. The guarantees by the subsidiary Guarantors may be subject to review under federal and state laws if a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit, including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were commenced at some future date by, or on behalf of, the unpaid creditors of a Guarantor. Under the federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce a subsidiary Guarantor's guarantee, or may subordinate the Notes or such guarantee to the applicable subsidiary Guarantor's existing and future indebtedness. While the relevant laws may vary from state to state, a court might do so if it found that when the applicable subsidiary Guarantor entered into its guarantee, or, in some states, when payments became due under such guarantee, the applicable subsidiary Guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and:  was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;  was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or  intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. A court would likely find that a subsidiary Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for such guarantee if such subsidiary Guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of such guarantee. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine 29 Table of Contents whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, would be considered insolvent if:  the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its assets;  the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or  it could not pay its debts as they become due. A court might also avoid a guarantee, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the applicable subsidiary Guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. In addition, any payment by a subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to such subsidiary Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such Guarantor's creditors, and accordingly the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you had already received from such subsidiary Guarantor. To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, holders of Notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable subsidiary Guarantor. If a court were to take this action, the applicable Guarantor's assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable Guarantor's other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining Guarantors, if any. Each subsidiary guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the Guarantor's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being avoided under applicable fraudulent transfer laws or may reduce the Guarantor's obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless. In a Florida bankruptcy case, this kind of provision was found ineffective to protect guarantees. You may be required to sell your Notes if any gaming authority finds you unsuitable to hold them. Gaming authorities have the authority generally to require that any beneficial owner of our securities, including the Notes, file an application and be investigated for a finding of suitability. If a record or beneficial owner of a Note is required by any gaming authority to be found suitable, such owner will be required to apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days after request of such gaming authority or within such other time prescribed by such gaming authority. The applicant for a finding of suitability must pay all costs of the investigation for such finding of suitability. If a record or beneficial owner is required to be found suitable and is not found suitable, such record or beneficial owner may be required pursuant to the terms of the Notes or law to dispose of the Notes. See "Description of the NotesMandatory Disposition Pursuant to Gaming Laws." We are a holding company with no independent operations or assets. Repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries. We are a holding company and repayment of the Notes will be dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are Guarantors of the Notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash 30 Table of Contents from our subsidiaries. In addition, while the indenture governing the Notes limits the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. Our ability to service all of our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash flow, which is subject to factors that are beyond our control. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, a further deterioration in the economic performance of our casino properties may cause us to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. 31 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS This prospectus is delivered in connection with the sale of Notes by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in market making transactions. We will not receive any of the proceeds from such transactions. 32 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and consolidated capitalization as of March 31, 2013. This table should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" as well as our financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus. As of March 31, 2013 (amounts in thousands, unaudited) Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash(1) $ 103,579 Current portion of long-term debt $ 18,589 Debt(2): New Credit Facility(3) $ 1,625,000 Restructured Land Loan(4) 110,211 The Notes(5) 500,000 Other debt 43,723 Total debt $ 2,278,934 Total members' capital 692,643 Total capitalization $ 2,971,577 (1) Includes $102.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.4 million of restricted cash. (2) Debt amounts reflect the principal amount of indebtedness and do not include unamortized debt discounts recorded in accordance with GAAP, and accordingly, will not agree to the amounts reported on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. (3) As of March 31, 2013, we have $313.3 million of undrawn availability under the $350.0 million revolving component of the New Credit Facility after giving effect to the issuance of approximately $36.7 million of letters of credit and similar obligations.

Includes $7.2 million of accrued interest added to the principal amount of the debt in accordance with the terms of the debt. (5) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. 33 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading "Certain Definitions." In this description, the word "Company" refers only to Station Casinos LLC and not to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The Company issued the Notes as a single class of securities under an Indenture (the "Indenture" ), dated as of March 1, 2013, among itself, the initial Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee" ). We will issue the Notes under the Indenture. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA" ). The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. It does not restate such agreement in its entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights as holders of the Notes. Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under "Certain Definitions" have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture. Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees The Notes The Notes:  are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company;  are pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior Indebtedness;  are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future secured Indebtedness, including the Bank Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;  are senior in right of payment to any future senior subordinated or subordinated Indebtedness of the Company; and  are unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior unsecured basis. The Guarantees The Notes are guaranteed by each of the Guarantors, and, subject to compliance with applicable gaming laws, any future Subsidiary of the Company that is a guarantor under the Bank Credit Agreement. The Guarantors currently consist of each of the entities that is a guarantor under the Bank Credit Agreement. The Guarantees of the Notes:  are general senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor;  are pari passu in right of payment to all of the applicable Guarantor's existing and future senior Indebtedness;  are effectively subordinated to all secured Indebtedness of each Guarantor, including guarantees of the Bank Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness; and 34 Table of Contents  are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any Subsidiary of a Guarantor that is not a Guarantor. The Notes will not be guaranteed by any existing Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that is designated by the Company in accordance with the Indenture to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Accordingly, the Notes are not initially guaranteed by LandCo Holdings, Fertitta Interactive or any of their respective Subsidiaries, all of which are Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. As of March 31, 2013,we had approximately $1.625 billion of Indebtedness outstanding under the Bank Credit Agreement (excluding $36.7 million of outstanding letters of credit and $313.3 million of available undrawn revolving credit commitments). Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries held approximately 6.2% of our assets at March 31, 2013 and generated net revenues of $14.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will include contribution provisions designed to mitigate against the risk that the Guarantee could be found to constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. See "Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesFederal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the guarantees and require shareholders to return payments received from us or the guarantors." Each Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to the Company or another Guarantor without limitation, or with other Persons upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See "Certain CovenantsMerger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets." In the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of any Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or the sale of all of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor, whether by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, in either case provided that such sale or other disposition complies with the provisions set forth in "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales" (other than provisions for future application of the Net Cash Proceeds), or in the event of the designation of any Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, or upon a discharge of the Indenture in accordance with "Satisfaction and Discharge" or upon any Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of the Indenture, the Guarantor's Guarantee will be released. Each of the Guarantors is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company. Principal, Maturity and Interest The Notes are issued in the aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Company may issue additional notes from time to time. Any issuance of additional notes will be subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant described below under the caption "Certain CovenantsIncurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock." The Notes offered hereby and any additional notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, provided that if any additional notes are not fungible for United States federal income tax purposes with any of the Notes previously issued, such additional notes will have a separate CUSIP number. Notes are issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on March 1, 2021. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 7.50% per annum from the Issue Date. Interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, with the initial interest payment on September 1, 2013. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record of the Notes on the immediately preceding February 15 and August 15. 35 Table of Contents Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes If a holder has given wire transfer instructions to the Company, the Company will make all principal, premium and interest payments on Notes held by such holder in accordance with those instructions. All other payments on the Notes will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose unless the Company elects to make interest payments by check mailed to the holders at the addresses set forth in the register of holders; provided that all payments with respect to Global Notes, and any definitive Notes the holder of which has given wire transfer instructions to the Company, will be made by wire transfer. Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company's office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below and under "Redemption at Make-Whole Premium" and "Mandatory Redemption," the Company does not have the option to redeem the Notes prior to March 1, 2016. Thereafter, the Company has the option to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount thereof) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on March 1 of the years indicated below: Year Percentage 2016 105.625 % 2017 103.750 % 2018 101.875 % 2019 and thereafter 100.000 % Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at any time prior to March 1, 2016, redeem up to 35% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings of the Company at a redemption price in cash of 107.50% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the redemption date; provided that: (1) at least 65% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; (2) notice of any such redemption shall be given by the Company to the holders and the Trustee within 30 days after the consummation of any such Equity Offering; and (3) such redemption shall occur within 60 days of the date of such notice. Redemption at Make-Whole Premium At any time prior to March 1, 2016, the Company may also redeem all or any part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice mailed by first-class mail (or in the case of Notes held in book entry form, by electronic transmission) to each holder's registered address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of redemption. 36 Table of Contents Selection and Notice If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed among the holders of Notes as follows: (1) if the Notes are listed, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes are listed, or (2) if the Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot (in the case of a partial redemption) or in accordance with the procedures of DTC. No Note of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail (or in the case of Notes held in book entry form, by electronic transmission) at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Notices of redemption may be conditional in that the Company may, notwithstanding the giving of the notice of redemption, condition the redemption of the Notes specified in the notice of redemption upon the completion of other transactions, such as refinancings or acquisitions (whether of the Company or by the Company). If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption, subject to the satisfaction of any conditions to such redemption. On and after the redemption date, subject to the satisfaction of any conditions to such redemption, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption so long as the Company has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes to be redeemed. Mandatory Redemption Except as described below, the Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof; provided that no Note of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part) of such holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer" ) at an offer price in cash (the "Change of Control Payment" ) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and duration fees and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to the Trustee and each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the date specified in such notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date" ), pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Change of Control Offer may be made up to 60 days prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The Company will comply with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder and all applicable federal and state securities laws, and will include all instructions and materials necessary to enable holders to tender their Notes. To the extent that the provisions of any 37 Table of Contents such laws or rules conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Company's compliance with such laws and rules shall not in and of itself cause a breach of the Company's obligations under this covenant. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) on or prior to 10:00 A.M. New York City time, deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so accepted, together with an officers' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Company. The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered by such holder, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Bank Credit Agreement contains, and any future Credit Facilities or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Company becomes a party may contain, restrictions on the ability of the Company to purchase any Notes, and also may provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Company would constitute a default thereunder. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Company could seek the consents of its lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain all such requisite consents or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In such case, the Company's failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. There can be no assurance that in the event of a Change of Control the Company will have sufficient funds, or that it will be permitted under the terms of the Bank Credit Agreement, to satisfy its obligations with respect to any or all of the tendered Notes. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. 38 Table of Contents The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Company to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another Person or group may be uncertain. The presence of the Company's Note repurchase obligation in the event of a Change of Control may deter potential bidders from attempting to acquire the Company, whether by merger, tender offer or otherwise. Such deterrence may have an adverse effect on the market price for the Company's securities, particularly its common stock. Asset Sales Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary will, directly or indirectly: (1) consummate an Asset Sale unless such entity receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value of the assets sold or of which other disposition is made (as determined in good faith by the Board of such entity), and (2) consummate or enter into a binding obligation to consummate an Asset Sale unless at least 75% of the consideration received by such entity from such Asset Sale will be cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following shall be deemed to be cash: (a) any liabilities as shown on such entity's most recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto) (other than (i) Indebtedness subordinate in right of payment to the Notes, (ii) contingent liabilities and (iii) liabilities or Indebtedness to Affiliates of the Company) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets, and (b) to the extent of the cash received, any notes or other obligations or securities received by such Obligor from such transferee that are converted by such entity into cash within 180 days of receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to consummate an Asset Sale without complying with the foregoing provisions if: (1) such entity receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value of the assets or other property sold, issued or otherwise disposed of (as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of such entity), and (2) the consideration for such Asset Sale constitutes Productive Assets; provided that any non-cash consideration not constituting Productive Assets received by such entity in connection with such Asset Sale that is converted into or sold or otherwise disposed of for cash or Cash Equivalents at any time within 360 days after such Asset Sale shall constitute Net Cash Proceeds subject to the provisions set forth above. Upon the consummation of an Asset Sale, the Company or the affected Restricted Subsidiary will be required to apply an amount equal to all Net Cash Proceeds (excluding amounts received and considered as "cash" pursuant to clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph of this covenant) that are received from such Asset Sale within 360 days of the receipt thereof either: (1) to reinvest (or enter into a binding commitment to invest, if such investment is effected within 360 days after the date of such commitment) in Productive Assets or in Asset Acquisitions not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture, 39 Table of Contents (2) to repay Indebtedness under the Bank Credit Agreement (or other Indebtedness of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, secured by a Lien), and, in the case of any such repayment under any revolving credit or other facility that permits future borrowings, effect a permanent reduction in the availability or commitment under such facility, and/or (3) a combination of prepayment and reinvestment as permitted by the foregoing clauses (1) and (2). provided , however , that if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary contractually commits within such 360-day period to apply such Net Cash Proceeds within 180 days following such contractual commitment in accordance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) or (3), and such Net Cash Proceeds are subsequently applied as contemplated in such contractual commitment, then the requirement for application of Net Cash Proceeds as set forth in this paragraph shall be considered satisfied. Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not applied pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall constitute " Excess Net Proceeds ." No later than 20 business days following the date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Net Proceeds exceeds $50 million (the " Net Proceeds Trigger Date "), the Company shall make an offer to purchase (the " Net Proceeds Offer "), on a date (the " Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date ") not less than 30 nor more than 60 days following the applicable Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date, on a pro rata basis, an aggregate principal amount equal to the Excess Net Proceeds of (a) Notes, at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, on the Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date, and (b) other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company which is pari passu with the Notes, in each case to the extent required by the terms thereof. If at any time within 360 days after an Asset Sale any non-cash consideration received by the Company or the affected Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such Asset Sale (other than non-cash consideration deemed to be cash as provided in clause (2)(b) above) is converted into or sold or otherwise disposed of for cash, then such conversion or disposition will be deemed to constitute an Asset Sale hereunder and the Net Cash Proceeds thereof will be applied in accordance with this covenant. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes or other pari passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to the Net Proceeds Offer is less than the Excess Net Proceeds, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining proceeds of such Asset Sales for general corporate purposes (but subject to the other terms of the Indenture). Upon completion of a Net Proceeds Offer, the Excess Net Proceeds relating to such Net Proceeds Offer will be deemed to be zero for purposes of any subsequent Asset Sale. In the event that a Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, only that portion of the Net Cash Proceeds therefrom (including any Net Cash Proceeds received upon the sale or other disposition of any non-cash proceeds received in connection with an Asset Sale) that are distributed to or received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary will be required to be applied by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of this covenant. The Company will comply with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder and all applicable federal and state securities laws, and will include all instructions and materials necessary to enable holders to tender their Notes and, to the extent that the provisions of any such laws or rules conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Company's compliance with such laws and rules shall not in and of itself cause a breach of the Company's obligations under this covenant. 40 Table of Contents Mandatory Disposition Pursuant to Gaming Laws If a record or a beneficial owner of a Note is required by any Gaming Authority to be found suitable, the owner shall apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the request of such Gaming Authority or within such other time prescribed by such Gaming Authority. The applicant for a finding of suitability must pay all costs of the investigation for such finding of suitability. If a holder or beneficial owner is required to be found suitable and is not found suitable by such Gaming Authority, (i) such owner shall, upon request of the Company, dispose of such owner's Notes within 30 days or within that time prescribed by such Gaming Authority, whichever is earlier, or (ii) the Company may, at its option, redeem such owner's Notes at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof or (y) the price at which the Notes were acquired by such owner, together with, in either case, accrued interest to the date of the finding of unsuitability by such Gaming Authority, or (z) such other amount required by such Gaming Authority. By accepting a Note, each holder or beneficial owner of a Note will be agreeing to comply with all requirements of the Gaming Laws and Gaming Authorities in each jurisdiction where the Company and its Affiliates are licensed or registered under applicable Gaming Laws or conduct gaming activities. Certain Covenants Restricted Payments. Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary will, directly or indirectly: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution (other than dividends or distributions payable solely in Qualified Capital Stock of the Company or dividends or distributions payable to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) in respect of the Company's or any Restricted Subsidiary's Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's Equity Interests in their capacity as such, (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) Equity Interests of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or of any direct or indirect parent of the Company (other than any such Equity Interests owned by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary), (3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, defease, redeem, prepay, decrease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness that is subordinate in right of payment to the Notes, except (i) a payment of principal, interest or other amounts required to be paid at Stated Maturity or (ii) a payment made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (4) make any Investment (other than Permitted Investments) (each of the foregoing prohibited actions set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) being referred to as a "Restricted Payment" ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may make any Restricted Payment so long as, at the time of such proposed Restricted Payment or immediately after giving effect thereto, (1) no Default or an Event of Default has occurred, and is continuing or would result therefrom, (2) the Company's Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.00 to 1.00; and 41 Table of Contents (3) the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments (the amount expended for such purposes, if other than in cash, being the fair market value of such property as determined in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Company) do not exceed or would not exceed the sum, without duplication, of: (a) 50% of the cumulative Consolidated Net Income (or if cumulative Consolidated Net Income shall be a loss, minus 100% of such loss) of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries during the period (treating such period as a single accounting period) beginning with the fiscal quarter in which the Issue Date occurs and ending on the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter of the Company ending immediately prior to the date of the making of such Restricted Payment for which internal financial statements are available ending not more than 135 days prior to the Determination Date, plus (b) 100% of the fair market value of the aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from any Person (other than from a Subsidiary of the Company), from the issuance and sale of Qualified Capital Stock of the Company or the amount by which Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced by the conversion or exchange of debt securities or Disqualified Capital Stock into or for Qualified Capital Stock (to the extent that proceeds of the issuance of such Qualified Capital Stock would have been includable in this clause if such Qualified Capital Stock had been initially issued for cash) subsequent to the Issue Date and on or prior to the date of the making of such Restricted Payment (excluding any Qualified Capital Stock of the Company the purchase price of which has been financed directly or indirectly using funds (i) borrowed from the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, unless and until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid, or (ii) contributed, extended, guaranteed or advanced by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (including, without limitation, in respect of any employee stock ownership or benefit plan)); provided that such aggregate net proceeds are limited to cash, Cash Equivalents and other assets used or useful in a Related Business or the Capital Stock of a Person engaged in a Related Business, plus (c) 100% of the aggregate cash received by the Company subsequent to the Issue Date and on or prior to the date of the making of such Restricted Payment upon the exercise of options or warrants to purchase Qualified Capital Stock of the Company, plus (d) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is sold for cash or Cash Equivalents or otherwise liquidated or repaid for value, or any dividends, distributions, interest payments, principal repayments or returns of capital are received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of any Restricted Investment, the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of proceeds of such sale, liquidation, repayment, dividend, distribution, principal repayment or return of capital, in each such case valued at the cash or marked-to-market value of Cash Equivalents received with respect to such Restricted Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any), and to the extent that any Restricted Investment consisting of a guarantee or other contingent obligation that was made after the Issue Date is terminated or cancelled, the excess, if any, of (x) the amount by which such Restricted Investment reduced the sum otherwise available for making Restricted Payments under this second paragraph of the Restricted Payment covenant, over (y) the aggregate amount of payments made (including costs incurred) in respect of such guarantee or other contingent obligation; provided that such proceeds are limited to cash, Cash Equivalents and other assets used or useful in a Related Business of the Capital Stock of a Person engaged in a Related Business, plus (e) to the extent that any Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after the date the Issue Date, the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Restricted Investment of the Company and its Restricted 42 Table of Contents Subsidiaries in such Person as of the date it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or in such Unrestricted Subsidiary on the date of redesignation as a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) the fair market value of such Restricted Investment as of the date such Restricted Investment was originally made in such Person or, in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into a Restricted Subsidiary which Subsidiary was designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date, the amount of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries' Restricted Investment therein as determined under the last paragraph of this covenant, plus the aggregate fair market value of any additional Restricted Investments (each valued as of the date made) by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set forth in the preceding paragraphs will not prohibit the following Restricted Payments: (1) the payment of any dividend or the making of any distribution within 60 days after the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution if the making thereof would have been permitted on the date of declaration; provided such dividend will be deemed to have been made as of its date of declaration for purposes of this clause (1); (2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of Capital Stock of the Company or warrants, rights or options to acquire Capital Stock of the Company either (a) solely in exchange for shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the Company or warrants, rights or options to acquire Qualified Capital Stock of the Company, or (b) through the application of net proceeds of a substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the Company or warrants, rights or options to acquire Qualified Capital Stock of the Company;

(9) the payment of any dividend or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to the holders of its Equity Interests on a pro rata basis; (10) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of those stock options, or upon the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance share units to the extent necessary to satisfy tax withholding obligations attributable to such vesting; (11) the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends or distributions to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Capital Stock of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company issued on or after the Issue Date in accordance with the Consolidated Coverage Ratio test described below under the caption "Certain CovenantsIncurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock"; (12) that portion of Restricted Payments the payment for which consists exclusively of the Company's Qualified Capital Stock or proceeds from the substantially concurrent sale of the Company's Qualified Capital Stock;

(B) customary salary, bonus and other benefits payable to officers and employees of any direct or indirect parent company of the Company to the extent such salaries, bonuses and other benefits are attributable to the ownership or operation of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries (and, to the extent of the amount actually received from its Unrestricted Subsidiaries, in amounts required to pay such expenses to the extent attributable to the ownership or operation of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries); (C) general corporate overhead expenses of any direct or indirect parent company of the Company to the extent such expenses are attributable to the ownership or operation of the 44 Table of Contents Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, plus any amount of indemnification claims made by any director or officer of any direct or indirect parent company of the Company; and (D) reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with any unsuccessful debt or equity offering by such direct or indirect parent company of the Company; (14) so long as the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is taxed as a partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal, state and local tax purposes, payments pursuant to the Holding Company Tax Distribution Agreement (the "Company Tax Payments"); (15) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the repurchase of Indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee with any Excess Net Proceeds as provided in the covenant described under the caption "Repurchase at the Option of Holders Asset Sales" pursuant to provisions requiring such repurchase similar to those described in the covenant under the caption "Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control"; provided that all Notes tendered by holders thereof in connection with a Change of Control Offer or Net Proceeds Offer have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value; and (16) Restricted Payments in an amount not to exceed the amount paid to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in cash in respect of any Tribal Receivable, including any interest on the principal amount thereof.

For purposes of this covenant, it is understood that the Company may rely on internal or publicly reported financial statements even though there may be subsequent adjustments (including review and audit adjustments) to such financial statements. For avoidance of doubt, any Restricted Payment that complied with the conditions of this covenant, made in reliance on such calculation by the Company based on such internal or publicly reported financial statements, shall be deemed to continue to comply with the conditions of this covenant, notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments that may result in changes to such internal financial or publicly reported statements. The Board of the Company may designate any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be Unrestricted Subsidiaries if such designation would not cause a Default. For purposes of making such determination, all outstanding Investments by the Obligors (except to the extent repaid in cash or in kind) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments at the time of such designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of this covenant to the extent that such deemed Restricted Payments would not be excluded from such calculation under the second paragraph of this covenant. All such outstanding Investments will be deemed to constitute Investments in an amount equal to the fair market value of such Investments at the time of such designation (as determined in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Company). Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock. The Company will not, directly or indirectly: (1) Incur any Indebtedness or issue any Disqualified Capital Stock or (2) cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness or issue any Disqualified Capital Stock or preferred stock, in each case, other than Permitted Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company may issue Disqualified Capital Stock and may Incur Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Acquired Debt), and any Guarantor may issue preferred 45 Table of Contents stock or Incur Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Acquired Debt), if immediately after giving pro forma effect to such proposed Incurrence or issuance and the receipt and application of the net proceeds therefrom, the Company's Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be at least 2.00 to 1.00. The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following (collectively, "Permitted Indebtedness" ): (1) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness under the Bank Credit Agreement) as reduced by the amount of any scheduled amortization payments or mandatory prepayments when actually paid or permanent reductions thereof; (2) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company under the $500 million aggregate principal amount of Notes to be issued on the Issue Date and by the Guarantors under the Guarantees and the Exchange Notes and related Guarantees; (3) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the Bank Credit Agreement or other Credit Facilities; provided that the aggregate principal amount of all such Indebtedness outstanding under this clause (3) as of any date of Incurrence (after giving pro forma effect to the application of the proceeds of such Incurrence), including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred to repay, redeem, extend, refinance, renew, replace, defease or refund any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (3), shall not exceed the greater of (i) $2.4 billion and (ii) 4.50x Consolidated EBITDAM of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the twelve month period ended at the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements are available, to be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the aggregate amount of all Net Cash Proceeds of Asset Sales applied by an Obligor to repay Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales"; (4) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or any Guarantor, or of the Company to any Guarantor, for so long as such Indebtedness is held by an Obligor; provided that if as of any date any Person other than an Obligor acquires any such Indebtedness or holds a Lien in respect of such Indebtedness (other than a Permitted Lien), such acquisition or holding shall be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness not constituting Permitted Indebtedness under this clause (4) by the issuer of such Indebtedness; (5) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; (6) FF&E Financing and other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary solely to finance the construction or acquisition or improvement of, or consisting of Capitalized Leased Obligations Incurred to acquire rights of use in, capital assets useful in the Company's or such Subsidiary's business, as applicable, and, in any such case, Incurred prior to or within 270 days after the construction, acquisition, improvement or leasing of the subject assets, not to exceed $75 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time (including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred to repay, redeem, extend, refinance, renew, replace, defease or refund any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (6)) for all of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries; (7) Hedging Obligations and Interest Swap Obligations entered into not as speculative Investments but as hedging transactions designed to protect the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries against fluctuations in interest rates in connection with Indebtedness otherwise permitted hereunder or against exchange rate risk or commodity pricing risk; (8) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary arising in respect of (x) performance bonds, completion guarantees and similar arrangements (to the extent that the 46 Table of Contents Incurrence thereof does not result in the Incurrence of any obligation for the payment of borrowed money of others), in the ordinary course of business; provided , that such Indebtedness shall be Incurred solely in connection with the development, construction, improvement or enhancement of assets useful in the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or the development, improvement or enhancement of the operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or (y) Support Agreements; (9) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary arising in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, worker's compensation claims, payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar obligations, surety bonds and appeal bonds (to the extent that the Incurrence thereof does not result in the Incurrence of any obligation for the payment of borrowed money of others), in the ordinary course of business, in amounts and for the purposes customary in such Person's industry; (10) the guarantee by a Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Company or of any other Guarantor, or the guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary, provided such Indebtedness was outstanding on the Issue Date or was, at the time it was incurred, permitted to be incurred by the Company or such Guarantor or Restricted Subsidiary under the Indenture; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes, then the guarantee may only be incurred by a Guarantor and shall be subordinated to, or pari passu with, as applicable, the Notes to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed; (11) the issuance by any of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries to the Company or to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of shares of preferred stock; provided , however , that: (a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred stock being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and (b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such Restricted Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (11); (12) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the disposition of any business, assets or Subsidiary otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(16) Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount outstanding under this clause (16) as of any date of Incurrence, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred to repay, redeem, extend, refinance, renew, replace, defease or refund any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant 47 Table of Contents to this clause (16), not to exceed the greater of (a) $100 million and (b) 4% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets; and (17) Indebtedness representing deferred compensation to employees of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of business; (18) Indebtedness consisting of promissory notes issued by the Company to current or former officers, directors, managers and employees, their respective estates, spouses or former spouses to finance the purchase or redemption of Equity Interests of Holdco or the Company permitted by clause (6) of paragraph three under "Certain CovenantsRestricted Payments"; provided that (i) such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on terms (it being understood that, subject to the dollar limitation described below, such subordination provisions shall permit the payment of interest and principal in cash if no Event of Default has occurred) and (ii) the aggregate amount of all cash payments (whether principal or interest) made by the Company in respect of such notes since the Issue Date, when combined with the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments made pursuant to clause (6) of paragraph three under "Certain CovenantsRestricted Payments" since the Issue Date, shall not exceed $10 million;

(20) Indebtedness consisting of (i) the financing of insurance premiums or (ii) take-or-pay obligations contained in supply arrangements, in each case, in the ordinary course of business; (21) Acquired Debt and any other Indebtedness incurred to finance a merger, consolidation or other acquisition; provided that (x) immediately after giving effect to the incurrence to such Acquired Debt and such other Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro forma basis as if such occurrence (and the related merger, consolidation or other acquisition) had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, the Company's Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than the Company's Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or other acquisition and (y)(i) in the case of Acquired Debt, has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity equal to greater than three years and (ii) in the case of any such other Indebtedness, has a final maturity at least 91 days after the Stated Maturity of the Notes and has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity greater than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Notes; and (22) Indebtedness, Disqualified Capital Stock or preferred stock of the Company to the extend the net proceeds thereof are promptly deposited to defease the Notes as described under "Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance." For purposes of this definition, it is understood that the Company may rely on internal or publicly reported financial reports even though there may be subsequent adjustments (including review and audit adjustments) to such financial statements. For avoidance of doubt, any incurrence of Permitted Indebtedness which is based upon or made in reliance on a computation based on such internal or publicly reported financial statements shall be deemed to continue to comply with the applicable covenant, notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments that may result in changes to such internal or publicly reported financial statements. All Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date shall be deemed to have been incurred under clause (3) and the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness. Any Indebtedness of any Person existing at the time it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (whether by merger, consolidation, acquisition of capital stock or otherwise) shall be deemed to be Incurred as of the date such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary. 48 Table of Contents Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company or of Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary will not constitute a separate incurrence, or amount outstanding, of Indebtedness so long as the Indebtedness so guaranteed was incurred in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Indebtedness described in clauses (1) through (22) of such definition or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant, the Company will, in its sole discretion, classify such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and such item of Indebtedness will be treated as having been Incurred pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to the second paragraph hereof. The Company may reclassify such Indebtedness from time to time in its sole discretion and may classify any item of Indebtedness in part under one or more of the categories of Permitted Indebtedness and/or in part as Indebtedness entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant. Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of principal amount or dividends, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms or the payment of dividends on any Disqualified Capital Stock in the form of additional Disqualified Capital Stock with the same terms will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Capital Stock or preferred stock for purposes of this covenant. Any increase in the amount of Indebtedness solely by reason of currency fluctuations will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant. A change in GAAP that results in an obligation existing at the time of such change, not previously classified as Indebtedness, becoming Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. Liens. No Obligor will, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or assume any Lien, except a Permitted Lien, on or with respect to any of its property or assets including any shares of stock or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary, whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, unless: (1) in the case of any Lien securing Indebtedness that is subordinate in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantees, the Notes or the Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Lien as long as such Indebtedness is secured by such Lien; and (2) in all other cases, the Notes or the Guarantees, as the case may be, are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the obligations secured by such Lien for so long as such obligations are secured by such Lien. Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or permit or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock, (2) make loans or advances to or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or to any other Restricted Subsidiary, or (3) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or to any Restricted Subsidiary (each such encumbrance or restriction in clause (1), (2) or (3), a "Payment Restriction" ). 49 Table of Contents However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (a) applicable law or required by any Gaming Authority; (b) the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees and other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary ranking pari passu with the Notes; provided that such restrictions are no more restrictive taken as a whole than those imposed by the Indenture; (c) customary non-assignment provisions of any contract, license or lease of any Restricted Subsidiary entered into in the ordinary course of business of such Restricted Subsidiary; (d) any instrument governing Acquired Debt Incurred in connection with an acquisition by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the Indenture as the same was in effect on the date of such Incurrence; provided that such encumbrance or restriction is not, and will not be, applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries or the property or assets, including directly related assets, such as accessions and proceeds so acquired or leased; (e) any restriction or encumbrance contained in contracts for the sale of Equity Interests of any Subsidiary or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to be consummated in accordance with the Indenture solely in respect of Equity Interests (or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary) or assets to be sold pursuant to such contract; (f) any restrictions of the nature described in clause (3) above with respect to the transfer of assets secured by a Lien that is permitted by the Indenture to be Incurred; (g) any encumbrance or restriction contained in Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction contained in any such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are no less favorable to the holders of the Notes in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the Company than the provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction contained in the Indebtedness being refinanced; (h) agreements governing Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the Issue Date, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacement or refinancings are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the date of the Indenture, taken as a whole; (i) any restriction imposed by Indebtedness incurred under the Credit Facilities; provided that such restriction or requirement is no more restrictive taken as a whole than that imposed by the Bank Credit Agreement as of the Issue Date; (j) provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements and other similar agreements not prohibited by the Indenture; (k) any restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or lessors or required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business; (l) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending the sale or other disposition; or (m) agreements in existence with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary at the time it is so designated, so long as such agreements are not entered into in anticipation or contemplation of such designation. 50 Table of Contents Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets. The Company may not, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any Person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person unless: (1) either (a) in the case of a consolidation or merger, the Company, or any successor thereto, is the surviving or continuing corporation, or (b) the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of the properties and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Successor" ), (i) shall be a corporation or limited liability company organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and (ii) shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), executed and delivered to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest and duration fees on all of the Notes and the performance of every covenant of the Notes and the Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed; (2) in the event that such transaction involves (a) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of additional Indebtedness (and treating any Indebtedness not previously an obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred in connection with or as a result of such transaction as having been incurred at the time of such transaction) and/or (b) the assumption contemplated by clause (1)(b)(ii) above (including giving effect to any Indebtedness and Acquired Debt Incurred or anticipated to be Incurred in connection with or in respect of such transaction), then immediately after giving effect to such incurrence and/or assumption under clauses (a) and (b), (i) the Company, or any such other Person assuming the obligations of the Company through the operation of clause (1)(b) above, could Incur at least $1.00 of Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) pursuant to the Consolidated Coverage Ratio test described above under the caption "Certain CovenantsIncurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" or (ii) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of the Company (or such other Person assuming the obligations of the Company through the operation of clause (1)(b) above) is no less than the Company's Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions; and (3) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the assumption contemplated by clause (1)(b)(ii) above (including, without limitation, giving effect to any Indebtedness and Acquired Debt Incurred or anticipated to be Incurred and any Lien granted in connection with or in respect of the transaction) no Default and no Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing; and Notwithstanding clause (2) or (3) above: (a) any Guarantor may consolidate with, or merge with or into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to the Company or to another Guarantor; and (b) the Company or any Subsidiary may consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to any Person that has conducted no business and Incurred no Indebtedness or other liabilities if such 51 Table of Contents transaction is solely for the purpose of effecting a change in the state of incorporation or form of organization of the Company or such Subsidiary. For purposes of the foregoing, the transfer (by lease, assignment, sale or otherwise, in a single transaction or series of transactions) of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, the Capital Stock of which constitutes all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company. Upon any consolidation or merger or any transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the foregoing, the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which such transfer is made shall succeed to and (except in the case of a lease) be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture with the same effect as if such successor corporation had been named therein as the Company and (except in the case of a lease) the Company shall be released from the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. No Guarantor may, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any Person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person (other than the Company or another Guarantor) unless: (1) either (a) in the case of a consolidation or merger, the Guarantor, or any successor thereto, is the surviving or continuing corporation, or (b) the Person (if other than the Guarantor) formed by such consolidation or into which the Guarantor is merged or the Person which acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of the properties and assets of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) shall be a corporation organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and (ii) shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, on the terms set forth in the Indenture; and (2) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the assumption contemplated by clause (1)(b)(ii) above (including, without limitation, giving effect to any Indebtedness and Acquired Debt Incurred or anticipated to be Incurred and any Lien granted in connection with or in respect of the transaction) no Default and no Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing. This section includes a phrase relating to the sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or a Guarantor and its Subsidiaries) taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, if the Company or its Subsidiaries (or a Guarantor and its Subsidiaries) dispose of less than all their assets by any means described above, the application of the covenant described in this section may be uncertain. Transactions with Affiliates. The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, 52 Table of Contents loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each of the foregoing, an "Affiliate Transaction" ), unless: (1) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate consideration in excess of $2 million, such Affiliate Transaction is, considered in light of any series of related transactions of which it comprises a part, on terms no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that might reasonably have been obtained at such time in a comparable transaction or series of related transactions on an arm's-length basis from a Person that is not such an Affiliate; (2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate consideration of $35 million or more to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of the Company (and of any other affected Restricted Subsidiary, where applicable) shall, prior to the consummation of any portion of such Affiliate Transaction, have approved such Affiliate Transaction, as evidenced by a resolution of its Board; and (3) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving value of $75 million or more to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, the Board of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall have received prior to the consummation of any portion of such Affiliate Transaction, a written opinion from an independent investment banking, valuation, accounting or appraisal firm of recognized national standing that such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view. The foregoing restrictions will not apply to: (1) reasonable fees, compensation and benefit arrangements (including any such compensation in the form of Equity Interests not derived from Disqualified Capital Stock, together with loans and advances, the proceeds of which are used to acquire such Equity Interests) paid to, and indemnity provided on behalf of, officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Company or its Subsidiaries as determined in good faith by the Board or senior management; (2) any transaction solely between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or between two or more Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent any such transaction is otherwise in compliance with, or not prohibited by, the Indenture; (3) any Restricted Payment permitted by the terms of the covenant described above under the heading "Certain CovenantsRestricted Payments" or any Permitted Investment; (4) sales of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Capital Stock) to any of the Company's Affiliates; (5) the pledge of the Equity Interests of Unrestricted Subsidiaries or joint ventures to support the Indebtedness thereof; (6) any transactions between the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Affiliate of the Company the Equity Interests of which Affiliate are owned solely by the Company or one or more of its Restricted Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and by persons who are not Affiliates of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, on the other hand; (7) payments and transactions contemplated by the Management Agreements, intellectual property licenses executed in connection therewith and payment of fees and expenses owing thereunder; (8) payments and transactions contemplated by the Related Party Agreements and (9) transactions pursuant to agreements existing on the Issue Date and any modification thereto or any transaction contemplated thereby in any replacement agreement therefor so long as such modification or replacement is not more disadvantageous to the Company or any of our 53 Table of Contents Restricted Subsidiaries in any material respect than the respective agreement existing on the Issue Date. Additional Subsidiary Guarantees. The Company shall cause (i) any Material Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and (ii) any Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor that becomes a guarantor under the Bank Credit Agreement after the Issue Date, to: (1) execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall unconditionally guarantee all of the Company's obligations under the Notes and the Indenture on the terms set forth in the Indenture; and (2) deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Restricted Subsidiary and constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of such Restricted Subsidiary. Thereafter, such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Guarantor for all purposes of the Indenture. No Layering. The Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, incur or suffer to exist Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor's Guarantee, as the case may be. Lines of Business. The Obligors will not engage in any lines of business other than the Core Businesses and any Related Business. Reports. Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the holders of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing or filings by the Company with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the Company were required to file such forms, including a "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and, with respect to the annual information only, a report thereon by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and (2) all current reports that would be required to be filed by the Company with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Company were required to file such reports, in each case within 30 days of the time periods such filings would be due as specified in the SEC's rules and regulations; provided that such delivery requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied if the Company files such information with the SEC via EDGAR or any successor thereto; provided, however, that the Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine if such filing or posting has occurred. In addition, the Company will file such information with the SEC to the extent the SEC is accepting such filings. The Company has agreed that, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding during any period when it is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or otherwise permitted to furnish the SEC with certain information pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, 54 Table of Contents it will furnish to the holders of the Notes and to the prospective investors, upon their reasonable request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. The Indenture permits the Company to deliver the consolidated reports or financial information of the Company to comply with the foregoing requirements. Events of Default and Remedies Each of the following constitutes an Event of Default: (1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes or the Guarantees; (2) default in payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes or the Guarantees when due and payable, at maturity, upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise; (3) failure by any Obligor to comply with any of its other agreements in the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees for 60 days after written notice to the Company by the Trustee or by holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default: (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default" ), or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity (which acceleration has not been rescinded, annulled or cured within 20 business days of receipt by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of such notice) and, in each case, the due and payable principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the due and payable principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $50 million or more; (5) failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $50 million, net of any applicable insurance, the carrier or underwriter with respect to which has acknowledged liability in writing, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgment or judgments become final and non-appealable; and (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default with respect to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, on all the Notes and Guarantees then outstanding to be due and payable, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee, if given by holders) specifying the Event of Default and that it is a "notice of acceleration" and, upon delivery of such notice, the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, on all Notes and Guarantees then outstanding will become immediately due and payable. Upon the 55 Table of Contents occurrence of specified Events of Default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium and Additional Interest, if any, will immediately and automatically become due and payable, without the necessity of notice or any other action by any Person. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. Notwithstanding clause (3) of the first paragraph above or any other provision of the Indenture, any failure to perform, or breach of, any covenant or agreement pursuant to "Certain CovenantsReports," shall not be a Default or an Event of Default until the 121st day after the Company has received the notice referred to in clause (3) of the first paragraph above (at which point, unless cured or waived, such failure to perform or breach shall constitute an Event of Default). Prior to such 121st day, remedies against the Company for any such failure or breach will be limited to Additional Interest at a rate per year equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the Notes from the 60th day following such notice to and including the 120th day following such notice. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or the Guarantees. The Company will be required to deliver to the Trustee annually statements regarding compliance with the Indenture. No Personal Liability of Managers, Directors, Officers, Employees or Stockholders No past, present or future director, officer, employee, agent, manager, partner, member, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor (or of any stockholder of the Company), in such capacity, will have any liability for any obligations of any Obligor under the Notes, the Indenture or the Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes and the Guarantees. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Guarantees ("Legal Defeasance") except for: (1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below; 56 Table of Contents (2) the Company's obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust; (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company's obligations in connection therewith; and (4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture. In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance") and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) described under "Events of Default and Remedies" will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance: (1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest and duration fees on the outstanding Notes on the stated maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; (2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that: (a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from transactions occurring contemporaneously with the borrowing of funds, or the borrowing of funds, to be applied to such deposit); (5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or 57 Table of Contents any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound (other than that resulting with respect to any Indebtedness being defeased from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to such Indebtedness, and the granting of Liens in connection therewith); (6) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an officers' certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and (7) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an officers' certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with. Transfer and Exchange A holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Company may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Amendment, Supplement and Waiver Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes). Without the consent of each holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder): (1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver, (2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or change the optional redemption dates or optional redemption price of the Notes from those stated under "Optional Redemption", (3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note, (4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration), (5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes, 58 Table of Contents (6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, (7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the conditions described above under the captions "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control" and "Asset Sales"), (8) contractually subordinate the Notes or the Guarantees to any other Indebtedness or (9) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without notice to or the consent of any holder of Notes, the Obligors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency as evidenced in an Officers' Certificate, to provide for uncertificated Notes or Guarantees in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or Guarantees, to provide for the assumption of the Obligors' obligations to holders of Notes in the case of a merger, consolidation or disposition of all or substantially all assets, to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder, to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, to comply with requirements of applicable Gaming Laws or to provide for requirements imposed by applicable Gaming Authorities, to allow any Guarantor to execute a Guarantee with respect to the Notes, to evidence and provide for the acceptance of an appointment of a successor trustee, to provide for the issuance of additional Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Indenture or to conform the Indenture or the Notes to this "Description of the Notes." The consent of the Noteholders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. Governing Law The Indenture will provide that it, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York but without giving effect to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the law of another jurisdiction would be required thereby. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights or registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes issued thereunder, when: (1) either: (a) all Notes that have been authenticated (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust), have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption (and all conditions to such redemption having been satisfied or waived) or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in 59 Table of Contents U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; (2) the Company or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and (3) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.

Upon compliance with the foregoing, the Trustee shall execute proper instrument(s) acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge of all of the Company's obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue in certain circumstances or resign. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. In case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. However, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The Global Notes representing the notes will be deposited with a custodian for DTC, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes ("Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, or persons that hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC and its participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the U.S., may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests are not considered the owners or "holders" of notes for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC (or its nominees) will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture governing the notes. In addition, participants in DTC must rely on the procedures of DTC and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the indenture. Neither the Company nor the Trustee has any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests. Depository Procedures The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Company takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised the Company that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the "Participants") and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC's system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the "Indirect Participants"). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised the Company that, pursuant to procedures established by it, ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes). 86 Table of Contents Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or "holders" thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Company and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC's records or any Participant's or Indirect Participant's records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC's records or any Participant's or Indirect Participant's records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised the Company that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Company. Neither the Company nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Company and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under "Notice to Investors," transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC's procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC's rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised the Company that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of 87 Table of Contents the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if: (1) DTC (a) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, the Company fails to appoint a successor depositary; (2) the Company, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the Certificated Notes; or (3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes. In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in "Notice to Investors," unless that legend is not required by applicable law. Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See "Notice to Investors." Same Day Settlement and Payment The Company will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes, including principal, premium, if any, and interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee. The Company will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder's registered address. The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Company expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised the Company that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC's settlement date. 88 Table of Contents CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS This discussion describes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion is limited to holders who purchase the Notes for cash in this offering at their "issue price" (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of notes is sold for cash to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This discussion does not address rules relating to securities held by special categories of holders, including partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities (or investors therein), financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, tax-exempt organizations, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, U.S. expatriates, investors that hold Notes as part of a straddle, hedging, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, and U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. In addition, this section does not address any state, local or non-U.S. tax considerations and does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than U.S. federal income tax considerations (such as the estate and gift tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income or the withholding taxes and reporting requirements imposed by Section 1471 through 1474 of the Code). This summary is based upon the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), rulings, current administrative interpretations and official pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Such change could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences described below. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. This summary is not a comprehensive description of all of the U.S. federal tax consequences that may be relevant with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. We urge you to consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the Notes in your particular circumstances as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws. As used in this offering circular, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:  an individual who is a citizen or resident in the U.S.;  a corporation created or organized under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  a trust which either (1) is subject to supervision of a court within the U.S. and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all its substantial decisions, or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. person. As used in this offering circular, the term "non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of a partnership considering an investment in 89 Table of Contents the Notes should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the partner of the purchase, ownership and disposition by the partnership of the Notes. Possible Application of Rules Governing Contingent Payment Debt Instruments In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay an amount in excess of stated interest and/or principal on the Notes. The Treasury Regulations regarding debt instruments that provide for one or more contingent payments state that, for purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is a contingent payment debt instrument, remote and/or incidental contingencies are ignored. We believe that any such contingencies on the Notes are remote and/or incidental, and, accordingly, we will not treat the Note as contingent payment debt instrument. Our determination will be binding on all holders, except a holder that discloses its differing position in a statement attached to its timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year during which a Note was acquired. Our determination is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to challenge such determination, a holder might be required to accrue ordinary interest on the Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and to treat as ordinary interest income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. Holders Stated interest Stated interest on the Notes generally will be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at the time that it is paid or accrued, in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note You will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash and the fair market value of other property received in exchange for the Note, other than any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, and (2) your adjusted tax basis in the Note. Amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest are treated as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. Holder. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost for such Note. Any gain or loss recognized will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. For certain non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals), long-term capital gains are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The ability of U.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations under the Code. Backup withholding and information reporting You may be subject to information reporting with respect to the payments of interest on the Notes and the proceeds of a sale, retirement, redemption or other disposition of a Note, unless you are an exempt recipient (such as a corporation). Backup withholding may apply to the foregoing amounts unless you (1) are a corporation or other exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrate this fact, or (2) provide us or our agent with your taxpayer identification number, certify as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding, and otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a 90 Table of Contents payment to you will be allowed as a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund, provided the required information is furnished in a timely manner to the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders Interest Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, interest paid to you on the Notes will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, provided that the interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States and:  you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the capital or profits interest in Station Holdco;  you are not a "controlled foreign corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related to us through equity ownership;  you are not a bank receiving interest on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of your trade or business within the meaning of Code section 881(c)(3)(A); and  either (1) you provide us or our agent with a statement, on IRS Form W-8BEN or a suitable substitute form, signed under penalties of perjury that includes your name and address and certifies that you are not a U.S. person, or (2) an exemption is otherwise established. If you hold your Notes through certain foreign intermediaries or certain foreign partnerships, such foreign intermediaries or partnerships must also satisfy the certification requirements of applicable Treasury Regulations. If these requirements are not met, you will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% on interest payments, unless you provide us with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN (or a suitable substitute form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty. If you are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States to which interest on the Notes is effectively connected, such effectively connected interest will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, provided that you have provided a properly completed certification generally on IRS Form W-8ECI or, in certain circumstances, IRS Form W-8BEN. Instead, you will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if you were a U.S. Holder, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if you are a corporate non-U.S. Holder, you also may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments, for the taxable year (subject to reduction if an applicable income tax treaty so provides). Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note Any gain realized by you on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax unless (1) you are an individual who is present in the U.S. for a total of 183 days or more during the taxable year in which the gain is realized and other conditions are satisfied, or (2) the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so provides the gain is attributable to a "permanent establishment" maintained in the United States by you). If you are a non-U.S. Holder described in clause (1) above, you will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal income tax on any gain derived from the disposition, which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise). If you are a non-U.S. 91 Table of Contents Holder described in clause (2) above, you generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain derived from the sale in generally the same manner as effectively connected interest. Backup withholding and information reporting Backup withholding and related information reporting will not apply to payments of interest made with respect to the Notes if you provide the required certification (generally, an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8ECI) that you are a non-U.S. person or you otherwise establish an exemption, provided that the payor or withholding agent does not have actual knowledge that you are a U.S. person, or that the conditions of any exemption are not satisfied. In addition, payments of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a Note to or through a foreign office of a broker or the foreign office of a custodian, nominee, or other dealer acting on your behalf generally will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However, if the broker, custodian, nominee, or other dealer is a United States person, information reporting (but not backup withholding) generally will be required with respect to payments made to you unless the broker, custodian, nominee, or other dealer has documentation of your foreign status and the broker, custodian, nominee, or other dealer has no actual knowledge to the contrary. Payment of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a Note to or through the United States office of a broker is subject to information reporting and backup withholding, unless the holder certifies as to its non-U.S. person status or otherwise establishes an exemption from information reporting and backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund, provided the required information is furnished in a timely manner to the IRS. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding to your particular circumstance and the availability of, and procedure for obtaining, an exemption from backup withholding under current Treasury Regulations. 92 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION This prospectus is to be used by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and its affiliates in connection with offers and sales of the Notes in market-making transactions effected from time to time.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers Nevada Registrants Section 86.371 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "NRS") provides that unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an agreement signed by the member or manager to be charged, no member or manager of any limited liability company is individually liable for the debts or liabilities of the company. NRS 86.411 provides that a limited liability company may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the company, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a manager, member, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, member, employee or agent of another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. NRS 86.421 provides that a limited liability company may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a manager, member, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, member, employee or agent of another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner in which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company. Indemnification may not be made for any claim, issue or matter as to which such a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the company or for amounts paid in settlement to the company, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper. NRS 86.431 provides that to the extent that a manager, member, employee or agent of a limited-liability company has been successful in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described in the preceding two paragraphs, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the company must indemnify such person against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense. Any indemnification under the preceding two paragraphs, unless ordered by a court or advanced pursuant to the procedures of the paragraph below, may be II-1 Table of Contents made only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances in accordance with NRS 86.431(2). NRS 86.441 states that the articles of organization, the operating agreement or a separate agreement may provide that the limited liability company must pay the expenses of members and managers incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding, as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the manager or member to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the member or manager is not entitled to be indemnified. NRS 86.451 provides that the indemnification or advancement of expenses discussed above (1) does not exclude any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the articles of organization or any operating agreement, vote of members or disinterested managers, if any, or otherwise, for an action in the person's official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding office, except that indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant to NRS 86.421 or for the advancement of expenses made pursuant to NRS 86.441, may not be made to or on behalf of any member or manager if a final adjudication establishes that the member's or the manager's acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of action; and (2) continues for a person who has ceased to be a member, manager, employee or agent and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. NRS 86.461 permits a limited liability company to purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any current or former member, manager, employee or agent of the company, or any person who is or was serving at the request of the company as a manager, member, employee or agent of another corporation, limited-liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against the person and liability and expenses incurred by the person in his or her capacity as a manager, member, employee or agent, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the company has the authority to indemnify such a person against such liability and expenses. California Registrants Under Section 17155 of the California Code, except for a breach of duty, the articles of organization or written operating agreement of a limited liability company may provide for indemnification of any person, including, without limitation, any manager, member, officer, employee, or agent of the limited liability company, against judgments, settlements, penalties, fines or expenses of any kind incurred as a result of acting in that capacity. A limited liability company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any manager, member, officer, employee, or agent of the limited liability company against any liability asserted against or incurred by the person in that capacity or arising out of the person's status as a manager, member, officer, employee, or agent of the limited liability company. Equityholders Agreement Sections 6.1(a) and 6.1(b) of the Equityholders Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2011 and amended as of July 1, 2012, provides for indemnification of the Company's and the Guarantors' directors, officers, managers, employees and other agents (the "Indemnified Persons") to the fullest extent permitted by law, including from and against any reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) (i) suffered or sustained by reason of any act performed or omission made by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred on such Indemnified Person and otherwise not inconsistent with its duties owed to such II-2 Table of Contents Company or Guarantor, (ii) actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (other than one by or in the right of the Company or any Guarantor) if such Indemnified Person acted in good faith and in a manner which such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be in furtherance of the interests of the Company or such Guarantor and otherwise not inconsistent with its duties owed to the Company or such Guarantor and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful, and (iii) actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense or settlement of an action or suit by or in the right of the Company or any Guarantor to procure a judgment in its favor if such Indemnified Person acted in good faith and in a manner which such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be in furtherance of the interests of the Company or such Guarantor and otherwise not inconsistent with its duties owed to the Company or such Guarantor.

(a) Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes: (1) to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement.; and (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such posteffective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; (3) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering; (4) that, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, if the registrants are subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use; (5) that, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrants relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; II-10 Table of Contents (ii) any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants or used or referred to by the undersigned registrants; (iii) the portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrants or their securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants; and (iv) any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrants to the purchaser. (b) Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes to deliver or cause to be delivered with the prospectus, to each person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest annual report to security holders that is incorporated by reference in the prospectus and furnished pursuant to and meeting the requirements of Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and, where interim financial information required to be presented by Article 3 of Regulation S-X are not set forth in the prospectus, to deliver, or cause to be delivered to each person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest quarterly report that is specifically incorporated by reference in the prospectus to provide such interim financial information. (c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of any registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the each of the registrants has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (d) Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes that for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (e) Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes that for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
