This summary may not contain all of the information that may be important to you in making your investment decision. You should read the entire prospectus, including the financial data and related notes and the section entitled Risk Factors, before making an investment decision. Unless the context otherwise indicates as used in this prospectus, references to NCO Group, Inc., NCO, the Company, we, us and our refer to NCO Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The term guarantors refers to certain of NCOs subsidiaries that will guarantee on a senior subordinated unsecured basis the obligations of NCO under the notes. Our foreign subsidiaries, certain subsidiaries engaged in financing the purchase of delinquent receivables portfolios and any portfolio joint ventures, which are joint ventures engaged in portfolio financing transactions, will not be guarantors under the notes. Our Company We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. We are a leading provider of business process outsourcing services, referred to as BPO, primarily focused on accounts receivable management, referred to as ARM, and customer relationship management, referred to as CRM. Our outsourcing solutions include ARM, contact center support and back office support services for a diversified customer base. We provide a wide range of ARM services to our clients by utilizing an extensive technological infrastructure. Although traditional ARM services have focused on the recovery of delinquent accounts, we also engage in the recovery of current accounts receivable and early stage delinquencies (generally, accounts that are 180 days or less past due). Our CRM services allow our clients to strengthen their customer relationships by providing a high level of support to their customers and generate incremental sales by acquiring new customers. We support essential business functions across key portions of the customer life cycle including acquisition, growth, care, resolution and retention. The primary market sectors we support in our BPO business are financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, retail and commercial, utilities, education, technology, transportation/logistics and government. We also purchase and manage past due consumer accounts receivable from consumer creditors such as banks, finance companies, retail merchants, utilities, healthcare companies, and other consumer-oriented companies. We operate our business in three segments: ARM, CRM and Portfolio Management. Our extensive industry knowledge, technological expertise, management depth, international scale, broad service offerings and long-standing client relationships enable us to deliver customized solutions that help our clients reduce their operating costs, increase cash flow, and improve their customers experience. We provide our services through our customer-driven model that provides optimal performance, leading-edge technology, proven efficiency and quality, to a wide range of clients in North America and abroad. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 33,900 full and part-time employees (including approximately 1,300 non-employee personnel utilized through subcontractors) who provide our services through our network of over 100 offices in 10 countries. In January 2008, we acquired Systems & Services Technologies, Inc., referred to as SST, a leading third-party consumer receivable servicer. Additionally, in February 2008, we acquired Outsourcing Solutions Inc., referred to as OSI, a leading provider of business process outsourcing services, specializing primarily in accounts receivable management services. On November 15, 2006, NCO Group, Inc. was acquired by and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Collect Holdings, Inc., an entity controlled by One Equity Partners II, L.P., a private equity firm, and its affiliates, with participation by Michael J. Barrist, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NCO Group, Inc., certain other members of executive management and other co-investors, 1 Table of Contents referred to as the Transaction. Subsequent to the date of the Transaction, NCO Group, Inc. was merged with and into Collect Holdings, Inc., and Collect Holdings, Inc. was renamed NCO Group, Inc. Industry Background Companies are outsourcing many essential, non-core business functions in order to focus on revenue-generating activities and core competencies, reduce costs and improve productivity and service levels. In particular, many large corporations are recognizing the advantages of outsourcing accounts receivable management and customer service and support. This trend is being driven by a number of industry-specific factors, including: · an increase in the complexity of collection and other customer service processes, which requires sophisticated call management and database systems for efficient operations; · the lack of expertise, resources and infrastructure necessary to provide optimal customer support due to the growing scope and complexity of such activities; · significant economies of scale achievable by third parties with focused capabilities; and · a trend in certain industries to outsource essential, non-core functions due to competitive pressures, regulatory considerations and/or required capital expenditures. We currently focus on the ARM and CRM segments of the BPO market. Both of these industry segments have experienced growth in recent years, driven by the increasing penetration of outsourcing services, the continuing growth in consumer and commercial debt, an increased focus on building long-term customer relationships and a shift away from large scale in-house implementations to BPO. The BPO industry is highly fragmented in the United States. The leading providers of BPO services are large multinational companies. We believe that many smaller competitors have insufficient capital to expand and invest in technology and are unable to meet the geographic coverage, and regulatory requirements and quality standards demanded by businesses seeking to outsource their essential, non-core business functions. Business Strategy Our primary business strategy is to strengthen our position in the ARM and CRM markets, and to opportunistically expand our service offerings to other complementary BPO services. Expand our relationships with clients  An integral component of our growth strategy is focused on the expansion of existing client relationships. We plan to continue to grow these relationships and the resulting opportunities in both scale and depth. We believe these relationships will continue to transition from vendor relationships, focusing on the operational delivery of services, to strategic partnerships focused on long-term, goal-oriented delivery of services. A key focus of this strategy is leveraging existing client relationships in one market to cross-sell our services in other markets. Enhance our operating margins  We intend to continue pursuing the following initiatives to increase profitability: · standardization of systems and practices; · consolidation of facilities; 2 Table of Contents · automation of clerical functions; · utilization of near shore and offshore labor; · use of statistical analysis to improve performance and reduce operating expenses; · use of segmentation strategy to improve profitability; and · leveraging our international size and presence. Continuously improve business processes  We intend to continue developing and enhancing our technology and infrastructure with initiatives that improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance client service. Examples of our recent initiatives include: · Enhanced data management and analytics: We have implemented both client-specific and pooled segmentation models to focus better our collections efforts. These models, coupled with iterative segment-based treatment testing, provide benefits by reducing operating expense and increasing collection revenues. Segmentation allows us to focus resources on accounts with the highest likelihood of recovery, and devote less costly resources to lower probability accounts. Additionally, we began applying the use of segmentation models to make more strategic portfolio purchase decisions. · Online access for our clients customers: We implemented a self-service website to allow our clients customers to access their accounts with us. Customers can use the website to update their account information, request statements and make payments. We plan to expand the functionality of the website to enhance customer service and improve collections for our clients. · Pattern recognition system: Our pattern recognition system is designed to determine the patterns and profiles that precede customer decisions such as purchase or defection. Leveraging predictive analytic technologies increases the ability to predict customers behaviors, thus improving the results of the outsourced solutions we provide to our clients, as well as improving our purchased portfolio analytics, while reducing our costs. · Technology upgrades : We are continuously upgrading and fine-tuning our technology to meet current and future client needs, while maximizing our investment through aggressive re-use philosophy wherever possible. · Enhanced data security: We continue to deploy both physical and system security enhancements to help ensure ongoing protection and privacy of NCOs and clients data as well as network and systems hardening. We incorporate sophisticated password, access and authentication controls, and emphasize security awareness training programs. Expand internationally  We believe that the BPO industry is gaining widespread acceptance throughout Canada, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. Our international expansion strategy is designed to continue to capitalize on each of these markets in the near term, as well as continue to develop access to lower-cost foreign labor. We believe we are a leading provider of BPO services in Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia. During 2008, we expanded our presence in Australia, and began providing services in Mexico, both through acquisitions. We expect to further penetrate all of these markets through increased sales of ARM and CRM services, as well as through the pursuit of accounts receivable purchasing opportunities. Additionally, we expect to pursue direct 3 Table of Contents investments, strategic alliances and partnerships as well as further explore acquisitions in these markets and other markets. Continue to pursue debt purchasing opportunities  Since 1999, we have expanded our portfolio purchase platform. In 2005, we expanded our presence in the medical and utilities industries, as well as with telecommunication companies and credit card issuers. We purchased an aggregate of $126.5 million (in terms of cost) of portfolios of accounts receivable in 2008. Our strategic plan focuses on purchasing larger portfolios of accounts receivable and medical receivables, for which we currently believe there is less competition; however, we also expect that in the near future, we may limit our overall investment in portfolio purchases. Through enhanced analysis of portfolio performance and utilizing the collections experience of our ARM business for similar classes of debt, we have been able to target the most profitable segments within available portfolios. In order to facilitate our purchase of large portfolios of accounts receivable, we have an agreement with a lender to finance such purchases on a nonrecourse basis. We also sell certain older, unresolved accounts and bankruptcy status accounts based on a low probability of payment under our collection platform and other criteria. These accounts can generally be sold currently for more than we can collect over time, net of servicing costs. While our principal portfolios continue to be larger credit card and U.S.-based consumer receivables, we have expanded our purchases to include telecommunications, utilities, medical and international purchase opportunities. Pursue strategic acquisition opportunities  We have developed a disciplined approach to acquisitions. We believe our approach enables us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses, personnel and facilities into our existing technology platform, personnel matrix and facilities. By leveraging our shared services and infrastructure, we facilitate the realization of cost synergies and growth of sales and earnings. We intend to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisitions on an opportunistic basis as they become available. The Transaction On November 15, 2006, NCO Group, Inc. was acquired by and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Collect Holdings, Inc., an entity controlled by One Equity Partners II, L.P., a private equity firm, and its affiliates, with participation by Michael J. Barrist, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NCO Group, Inc., certain other members of executive management and other co-investors. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NCO Group, Inc. shareholders received $27.50 in cash, without interest, for each share of NCO Group, Inc. common stock that they held. After the closing of the Transaction, NCO Group, Inc.s common stock was no longer publicly traded. Subsequent to the date of the Transaction, NCO Group, Inc. was merged with and into Collect Holdings, Inc., and Collect Holdings, Inc. was renamed NCO Group, Inc. As of the closing of the Transaction, One Equity Partners II, L.P. and its affiliates owned approximately 83.08 percent of our outstanding voting stock, Mr. Barrist and his family members and trusts formed for his or their benefit owned approximately 5.05 percent of our outstanding voting stock, members of NCOs executive management (other than Mr. Barrist) collectively owned approximately 0.51 percent of our outstanding voting stock and the balance of our outstanding voting stock was owned by the other co-investors. In addition, upon consummation of the Transaction, we adopted a restricted share plan and granted to members of NCOs executive management, in the aggregate, up to an additional 7.67 percent of our outstanding voting stock as of the closing of the Transaction. See Item 11. Executive 4 Table of Contents CompensationRestricted Share Plan in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 incorporated by reference into this prospectus. The Transaction was financed with: · equity contributions from One Equity Partners II, L.P. and its affiliates and certain co-investors (including members of NCOs executive management) and the rollover of a portion of NCO common stock held by Mr. Barrist and certain of his family members and trusts formed for his or their benefit; · a new $465.0 million senior credit facility; and · the private placement of $165.0 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes due 2013 and $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 11.875% senior subordinated notes due 2014. One Equity Partners The acquisition of our business was financed in part by a significant equity investment by One Equity Partners II, L.P. and its affiliates, referred to as One Equity Partners or OEP, a leading global private equity firm. One Equity Partners acts as a lead equity investor in management-led buyouts and growth capital financings, with a particular emphasis on corporate partnerships and divestitures. One Equity Partners manages over $8.0 billion in investments and commitments. 5 Table of Contents The Notes The following is a brief summary of the terms of the notes.

Guarantees The senior notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis, and the senior subordinated notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis, in each case, jointly and severally, by all of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than certain non-guarantor subsidiaries). Ranking The senior notes will be our unsecured senior obligations. Accordingly, the senior notes will: · rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors; · be senior in right of payment to all existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness (including with respect to the senior subordinated notes) and all future subordinated indebtedness, if any; · be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors; · be effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness of ours and the guarantors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and · be unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis, jointly and severally, by the guarantors. Similarly, the senior note guarantees will be unsecured senior obligations of the guarantors, and, accordingly, will: · rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors; · be senior in right of payment to all existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness (including with respect to senior subordinated notes) and all future subordinated indebtedness, if any; and · be effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness of the guarantors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The senior subordinated notes will be our unsecured senior subordinated obligations. Accordingly, the senior subordinated notes will: 7 Table of Contents · be subordinated in right of payment to all our existing and future senior indebtedness including the senior notes and borrowings under our senior credit facility; · be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors; · rank equally in right of payment with our future senior subordinated indebtedness, if any; · be senior in right of payment to our future subordinated indebtedness, if any, that expressly provides for its subordination to the notes; and · be unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis, jointly and severally, by the guarantors. Similarly, the senior subordinated note guarantees will be unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the guarantors, and, accordingly, will: · be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors including the guarantees of the senior notes and any borrowings and guarantees by the guarantors of indebtedness under our senior credit facility; · rank equally in right of payment with future senior subordinated indebtedness of the guarantors, if any; and · be senior in right of payment to future indebtedness, if any, of the guarantors that expressly provides for its subordination to the guarantors note guarantees. As of December 31, 2008, we and the guarantors had $1.0 billion of consolidated indebtedness outstanding, $815.3 million of which is senior indebtedness and $650.3 million of which is secured indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, our subsidiaries that are not guarantors had $98.9 million of consolidated total liabilities outstanding (excluding intercompany liabilities). Certain Covenants The terms of the notes, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: · incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; · pay certain dividends and make distributions in respect of capital stock; · place limitations on distributions from restricted subsidiaries; 8 Table of Contents · issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; · guarantee indebtedness; · sell or exchange assets; · enter into transactions with affiliates; · create certain liens; · engage in unrelated businesses; and · consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions.

Predecessor Successor For the Years Ended December 31, Period from January 1 through November 15, Period from July 13, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 2006(2) 2007(2) 2008(2) (in thousands, except for ratios) Earnings $ 116,650 $ 109,960 $ 73,567 $ (63,485 ) $ 55,520 $ (321,957 ) Fixed Charges $ 31,355 $ 36,056 $ 37,465 $ 16,563 $ 107,534 117,602 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges (1) 3.7 x 3.0 x 2.0 x (3.8) x 0.5 x (2.7) x (1) For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest, fixed charges and amortization of capitalized interest less interest capitalized and distributions to minority holders. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, capitalized interest, amortization of deferred financing charges not included in interest expense and a portion of rentals deemed to be interest. (2) For the period from July 13, 2006 through December 31, 2006, and for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges indicated a less than one-to-one coverage. The deficiency was a result of earnings that were $80.0 million, $52.0 million, and $439.6 million, respectively, less than fixed charges. 10 Table of Contents Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data The following table sets forth summary consolidated historical financial data of NCO and its subsidiaries. The summary historical consolidated financial data for the period from January 1, 2006 through November 15, 2006, for the period from July 13, 2006 through December 31, 2006, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 and as of December 31, 2007 and 2008 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 incorporated by reference into this prospectus. On January 2, 2008, we acquired SST, a third-party consumer receivable servicer for $17.7 million, consisting of a cash payment of $10.6 million and the issuance of 29,884.7 shares of our Series A 14% PIK Preferred Stock, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Prior to the acquisition, SST was a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., referred to as JPM. JPM also wholly owns OEP which, as described above, has had a controlling interest in us since the Transaction on November 15, 2006. NCO is the predecessor company prior to November 15, 2006 due to the relative size and management control of the respective companies. SFAS 141 states that a business combination excludes transfers of net assets or exchanges of equity interests between entities under common control. SFAS 141 also states that transfers of net assets or exchanges of equity interests between entities under common control should be accounted for similar to the pooling-of-interests method (as-if pooling-of-interests) in that the entity that receives the net assets or the equity interests initially recognizes the assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts of the transferring entity at the date of transfer. Since we were under common control with SST at the time of the SST acquisition, the transfer of assets and liabilities of SST were accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. However, the SEC staff has indicated that, in as-if pooling-of-interests accounting, the financial statements of the previously separate entities should not be combined for periods prior to the date that common control was established. For financial accounting purposes, the acquisition is viewed as a change in reporting entity and, as a result, requires restatement of our financial statements for all periods subsequent to November 15, 2006, the date of the Transaction and the date at which common control of us and SST by JPM commenced. On February 29, 2008, we acquired OSI, a leading provider of business processing outsourcing services, specializing in accounts receivable collections. The OSI acquisition was accounted for by using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141. The summary historical consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Item 6. Selected Financial Data, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto which appear in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 incorporated by reference into this prospectus. 11 Table of Contents Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Data (amounts in thousands) Predecessor Successor Period from January 1 through November 15, Period from July 13, 2006 (date of inception) through December 31, For the years ended December 31, 2006 2006 2007 2008 Statement of Operations Data: Revenues $ 1,049,801 $ 146,365 $ 1,285,430 $ 1,513,141 Operating costs and expenses: Payroll and related expenses 553,883 79,165 679,951 845,481 Selling, general and administrative expenses 375,150 50,122 459,170 562,339 Depreciation and amortization expense 46,695 12,228 102,349 121,324 Impairment of intangible assets  69,898  289,492 Restructuring charges 12,765   11,600 Income (loss) from operations 61,308 (65,048 ) 43,960 (317,095 ) Other expense 21,642 14,422 89,051 110,208 Income (loss) before provision for income taxes 39,666 (79,470 ) (45,091 ) (427,303 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 14,742 (3,522 ) (16,104 ) (71,947 ) Income (loss) before minority interest 24,924 (75,948 ) (28,987 ) (355,356 ) Minority interest (3,890 ) (157 ) (2,735 ) 18,250 Net income (loss) $ 21,034 $ (76,105 ) $ (31,722 ) $ (337,106 ) Statement of Cash Flows Data: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 109,672 $ (4,957 ) $ 43,995 $ 93,733 Net cash used in investing activities (15,946 ) (990,329 ) (32,719 ) (424,159 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (95,877 ) 1,010,775 (2,869 ) 332,204 December 31, 2007 2008 Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents $ 31,283 $ 29,880 Working capital 162,471 151,547 Total assets 1,677,999 1,701,639 Long-term debt, net of current portion 903,052 1,048,517 Minority interest 48,948 22,803 Stockholders equity 408,045 260,986 12 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this prospectus before deciding to invest in the notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. Risks Related to the Notes and Our Other Indebtedness Our substantial leverage and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business. We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. Our financial performance could be affected by our substantial leverage. At December 31, 2008, our total indebtedness was $1.1 billion, and we had $193,000 of borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility and $18.3 million of letters of credit outstanding. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This high level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us and you, including: · we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to the notes; · we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; · we will need to use all, or a substantial portion, of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities; · some of our debt, including our borrowings under our senior credit facilities, has variable rates of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates; · our debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions; · our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general; · our substantial amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; · our customers may react adversely to our significant debt level and seek or develop alternative suppliers; · we may have insufficient funds, and our debt level may also restrict us from raising the funds necessary, to repurchase all of the notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of a change of control, which would constitute an event of default under the notes; and 13 Table of Contents · our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, require us to maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. Our high level of indebtedness requires that we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, research and development or other general corporate or business activities, including future acquisitions. In addition, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, including indebtedness under the senior notes and our senior credit facility. If market interest rates increase, debt service on our variable-rate debt will rise, which would adversely affect our cash flow. Although our senior credit facility requires us to employ hedging strategies such that not less than 50 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan carries a fixed rate of interest for a period of three years following consummation of the Transaction, any hedging arrangement in place may not offer complete protection from this risk. Additionally, the remaining portion of the term loan and the revolving portion of the senior credit facility, as well as our other floating rate debt may not be hedged and, accordingly, the portion that is not hedged will be subject to changes in interest rates. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and meet our other ongoing liquidity needs and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may be unsuccessful. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations, including the notes, and to fund our planned capital expenditures and other ongoing liquidity needs, depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We may be unable to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may be unsuccessful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our senior credit facility and the indentures governing the notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from certain asset sales. We may be unable to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may be inadequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Despite our current leverage, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. The revolving credit portion of our senior credit facility provides commitments of up to $100.0 million, $193,000 of which was available for future borrowings, subject to certain conditions, as of December 31, 2008. All of those borrowings are secured, and as a result, are effectively senior to the notes and the guarantees of the 14 Table of Contents notes by our subsidiary guarantors. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. Our senior credit facility contains and the indentures governing the notes contain a number of restrictive covenants which will limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. Our senior credit facility and the indentures governing the notes impose, and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictions affect or will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: · incur additional indebtedness; · create liens; · pay dividends and make other distributions in respect of our capital stock; · redeem our capital stock; · purchase accounts receivable; · make certain investments or certain other restricted payments; · sell certain kinds of assets; · enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and · effect mergers or consolidations. In addition, our senior credit facility includes other more restrictive covenants. Our senior credit facility also requires us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. The restrictions contained in our senior credit facility and the indentures could: · limit our ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and · adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our senior credit facility and/or the indentures. If an event of default occurs under our senior credit facility, which includes an event of default under the indentures governing the notes, the lenders could elect to: 15 Table of Contents · declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable; · require us to apply all of our available cash to repay the borrowings; or · prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes; any of which could result in an event of default under the notes. The lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further financing. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings when due, our lenders could sell the collateral securing our senior credit facility, which constitutes substantially all of our and our domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries assets (other then certain assets relating to portfolio transactions). Although holders of the notes could accelerate the notes upon the acceleration of the obligations under our senior credit facility, we cannot assure you that sufficient assets will remain to repay the notes after we have paid all the borrowings under our senior credit facility and any other senior debt. We are a holding company and we depend upon cash from our subsidiaries to service our debt. If we do not receive cash distributions, dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make payments on the notes. We are a holding company and all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, we are dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of, and cash distributions, dividends and other payments from, our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations, including the required payments on the notes. If we do not receive such cash distributions, dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to pay the principal or interest on the notes. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries who are guarantors of the notes are holding companies that will rely on subsidiaries of their own as a source of funds to meet any obligations that might arise under their guarantees. Generally, the ability of a subsidiary to make cash available to its parent is affected by its own operating results and is subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in its debt instruments and other agreements. Although the indentures governing the notes will limit the extent to which our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to make dividend and other payments to us, these limitations will be subject to significant qualifications and exceptions. The indentures governing the notes also allow us to include the operating results of our subsidiaries in our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the indentures, for the purpose of determining whether we can incur additional indebtedness under the indentures, even though some of those subsidiaries are subject to contractual restrictions on making dividends or distributions of cash to us for the purposes of servicing such indebtedness. In addition, the indentures allow us to create limitations on distributions and dividends under the terms of our and any of our subsidiaries future credit facilities. Moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits. As a result, although our subsidiaries may have cash, we or our subsidiary guarantors may be unable to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligations under the notes or the guarantees, as applicable. Your right to receive payments on the notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets. Our obligations under the notes and our guarantors obligations under their guarantees of the notes are unsecured, but our obligations under our senior credit facility and each guarantors obligations 16 Table of Contents under their respective guarantees of the senior credit facility are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets (other than certain assets relating to portfolio transactions) and the assets and a portion of the stock of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under our senior credit facility, the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the indentures governing the notes at such time. Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. In any such event, because the notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims fully. See Description of Our Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2008, the notes and the guarantees were subordinated or effectively subordinated to $670.1 million of indebtedness (representing borrowings under our senior credit facility which did not include availability of approximately $193,000 under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility after giving effect to letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2008). The indentures will permit the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness by us and our restricted subsidiaries in the future, including secured indebtedness. Claims of noteholders will be structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and some of our U.S. subsidiaries because they have not guaranteed the notes. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and certain other domestic subsidiaries. Accordingly, claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinate to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. All obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the notes. As of December 31, 2008, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had total consolidated total liabilities (excluding intercompany liabilities) of $98.9 million, representing 6.9 percent of our total consolidated liabilities. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for $344.8 million, or 22.8 percent of our consolidated revenue, and had $49.9 million of net loss, compared to our consolidated net loss of $337.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for $261.0 million, or 15.3 percent, of our consolidated assets at December 31, 2008. Because a portion of our operations are conducted by subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the notes, our cash flow and our ability to service debt, including our and the guarantors ability to pay the interest on and principal of the notes when due, are dependent to a significant extent on interest payments, cash dividends and distributions and other transfers of cash from subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the notes. In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the notes to us and the guarantors, as applicable, could be subject to taxation or other restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency regulations in the jurisdiction in which these subsidiaries operate. Moreover, payments to us and the guarantors by subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the notes will be contingent upon these subsidiaries earnings. Our subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the notes are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we 17 Table of Contents or the guarantors have to receive any assets of any subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the notes upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt of that subsidiary. We also have joint ventures and subsidiaries in which we own less than 100 percent of the equity so that, in addition to the structurally senior claims of creditors of those entities, the equity interests of our joint venture partners or other stockholders in any dividend or other distribution made by these entities would need to be satisfied on a proportionate basis with us. These joint ventures and less than wholly-owned subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute cash to us in their financing or other agreements and, as a result, we may not be able to access their cash flow to service our debt obligations, including in respect of the notes. Your right to receive payments on the notes is junior to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and the guarantees of the notes are junior to all the guarantors existing and future senior indebtedness. The notes are general unsecured obligations that are junior in right of payment to all our existing and future senior indebtedness, including our senior credit facility. The guarantees are general unsecured obligations of the guarantors that are junior in right of payment to all of the applicable guarantors existing and future senior indebtedness, including our senior credit facility. We and the guarantors may not pay principal, premium, if any, interest or other amounts on account of the notes or the guarantees in the event of a payment default or certain other defaults in respect of certain of our senior indebtedness, including debt under our senior credit facility, unless the senior indebtedness has been paid in full or the default has been cured or waived. In addition, in the event of certain other defaults with respect to the senior indebtedness, we or the guarantors may not be permitted to pay any amount on account of the notes or the guarantees for a designated period of time. The subordination provisions in the notes and the guarantees provide that, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of us or any guarantor, our or the guarantors assets will not be available to pay obligations under the notes or the applicable guarantee until we or the guarantor has made all payments on its respective senior indebtedness. We and the guarantors may not have sufficient assets after all these payments have been made to make any payments on the notes or the applicable guarantee, including payments of principal or interest when due. As of December 31, 2008, the notes and the guarantees were subordinated or effectively subordinated to $670.1 million of indebtedness (representing borrowings under our senior credit facility which did not include availability of approximately $193,000 under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility after giving effect to letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2008). The indentures will permit the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness, including senior debt, by us and our restricted subsidiaries in the future. If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may be unable to make payments on the notes. Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our senior credit facility that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes and substantially decrease the market value of the notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, 18 Table of Contents and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including our senior credit facility), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek and obtain waivers from the required lenders under our senior credit facility to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our senior credit facility and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our senior credit facility, the lenders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. See Description of Our Senior Credit Facility and Description of Notes. Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and the guarantees and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes. The issuance of the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review under federal bankruptcy law or relevant state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes. While the relevant laws may vary from state to state, under such laws, generally, the payment of consideration will be a fraudulent conveyance if (1) we paid the consideration with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee, and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is also true: · we or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of the indebtedness; or · payment of the consideration left us or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business; or · we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that it would, incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries other debt that could result in the acceleration of such debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: · the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair salable value of all its assets; or · the present fair salable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or 19 Table of Contents · it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be further subordinated to our or any of our guarantors other debt. If the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the applicable guarantor and none of the proceeds of the notes were paid to any guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could thus void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantors other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no assurance that any active trading market will develop for the notes. The notes are securities for which there is no existing public market. Accordingly, the development or liquidity of any market for the notes is uncertain. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of markets that may develop for the notes, your ability to sell the notes or the price at which you would be able to sell the notes. We do not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on a securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system. The placement agents of the notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the placement agents are not obligated to make a market in the notes, and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Additionally, we are controlled by One Equity Partners, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., one of the placement agents of the notes. As a result of this affiliate relationship, if J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. conducts any market making activities with respect to the notes, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. will be required to deliver a market making prospectus when effecting offers and sales of the notes. For as long as a market making prospectus is required to be delivered, the ability of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. to make a market in the notes may, in part, be dependent on our ability to maintain a current market making prospectus for its use. If we are unable to maintain a current market making prospectus, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. may be required to discontinue its market making activities without notice. Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active market for the notes or notes will develop or, if developed, that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, the notes may trade at discounts from their initial offering prices, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our financial and operating performance and other factors. Risks Related to the Current Environment and Recent Developments Recent instability in the financial markets and global economy may affect our access to capital, our ability to purchase accounts, and the success of our collection efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and revenue. The stress experienced by global capital markets that began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during the second half of 2008. Recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining real 20 Table of Contents estate market in the U.S. have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated a recession. This economic downturn has adversely affected the ability and willingness of consumers to pay their debts and resulted in a weaker collection environment in 2008. The economic downturn may continue and unemployment may continue to rise. The ability and willingness of consumers to pay their debts could continue to be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, collections and revenue. Further deterioration in economic conditions in the United States may also lead to higher rates of personal bankruptcy filings. Defaulted consumer loans that we service or purchase are generally unsecured, and we may be unable to collect these loans in the case of personal bankruptcy of a consumer. Increases in bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, collections and revenue. Continued or further credit market dislocations or sustained market downturns may also reduce the ability of lenders to originate new credit, limiting our ability to service or purchase defaulted consumer loans in the future. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants, but the future impact on our operations and financial projections from the challenging economic and business environment may impact our ability to meet our debt covenants in the future. Further, increased financial pressure on the distressed consumer may result in additional regulatory restrictions on our operations and increased litigation filed against us. We are unable to predict the likely duration or severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital. The current global financial and credit crisis exposes us to a variety of risks. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months. Disruptions in the credit markets make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses and debt service obligations. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to limit our investment in growth opportunities or curtail operations. The principal sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations, including collections on purchased accounts receivable, bank borrowings, nonrecourse borrowings, and equity and debt offerings. As a result of the global financial crisis, there is a risk that one or more lenders in our senior credit facility syndicate could be unable to meet contractually obligated borrowing requests in the future. In the event current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions and the general availability of credit. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. 21 Table of Contents There can be no assurance that actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will achieve the intended effect. In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, the Federal Government, Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken action and are considering taking further actions to address the financial crisis. There can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility currently being experienced. Derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses. We are party to certain derivative transactions, such as interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts, with financial institutions to hedge against certain financial risks. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are not cash flow hedges are reported in income, and accordingly could materially affect our reported income in any period. Moreover, in the light of current economic uncertainty and potential for financial institution failures, we may be exposed to the risk that our counterparty in a derivative transaction may be unable to perform its obligations as a result of being placed in receivership or otherwise. In the event that a counterparty to a material derivative transaction is unable to perform its obligations thereunder, we may experience material losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business Our business is dependent on our ability to grow internally. Our business is dependent on our ability to grow internally, which is dependent upon: · our ability to retain existing clients and expand our existing client relationships; and · our ability to attract new clients. Our ability to retain existing clients and expand those relationships is subject to a number of risks, including the risk that: · we fail to maintain the quality of services we provide to our clients; · we fail to maintain the level of attention expected by our clients; · we fail to successfully leverage our existing client relationships to sell additional services; and · we fail to provide competitively priced services. Our ability to attract new clients is subject to a number of risks, including: · the market acceptance of our service offerings; 22 Table of Contents · the quality and effectiveness of our sales force; and · the competitive factors within the BPO industry. If our efforts to retain and expand our client relationships and to attract new clients do not prove effective, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We compete with a large number of providers in the ARM and CRM industries, and other purchasers of consumer debt. This competition could have a materially adverse effect on our future financial results. We compete with a large number of companies in the industries in which we provide services. In the ARM industry, we compete with other sizable corporations in the U.S. and abroad such as Alliance One, GC Services LP and IntelliRisk Management Corporation, as well as many regional and local firms. In the CRM industry, we compete with large customer care outsourcing providers such as Convergys Corporation, ICT Group, TeleTech Holdings, Inc., and West Corporation. We may lose business to competitors that offer more diversified services, have greater financial and other resources and/or operate in broader geographic areas than we do. We may also lose business to regional or local firms who are able to use their proximity to or contacts at local clients as a marketing advantage. In addition, many companies perform the BPO services offered by us in-house. Many larger clients retain multiple BPO providers, which exposes us to continuous competition in order to remain a preferred provider. Because of this competition, in the future we may have to reduce our fees to remain competitive and this competition could have a materially adverse effect on our future financial results. Our Portfolio Management business competes with other purchasers of delinquent consumer accounts receivable, such as Asset Acceptance Capital Corp., Encore Capital Group, Inc. and Portfolio Recovery Associates, Inc. The purchased accounts receivable business had become increasingly competitive over the past few years, with several new companies entering the market. Historically, our industry has attracted a large amount of investment capital. However, the recent downturn in the economy has impacted available capital and collectability, resulting in lower pricing and less competition for portfolios. Our competitors may have greater financial resources or access to credit to purchase portfolios than we do, and may be able to outbid us on available portfolios. In the future we may have to pay more for our portfolios, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Many of our clients are concentrated in the financial services, telecommunications, and healthcare sectors. If any of these sectors performs poorly or if there are any adverse trends in these sectors it could materially adversely affect us. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we derived approximately 31.7 percent of our revenue from clients in the financial services sector, approximately 21.9 percent of our revenue from clients in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 12.4 percent of our revenue from clients in the healthcare sector, in each case excluding purchased accounts receivable. If any of these sectors performs poorly, clients in these sectors may do less business with us, or they may elect to perform the services provided by us in-house. If there are any trends in any of these sectors to reduce or eliminate the use of third-party BPO service providers, it could harm our business and results of operations. 23 Table of Contents We have international operations and utilize foreign sources of labor, and various factors relating to our international operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, could adversely affect our results of operations. Approximately 6.1 percent of our 2008 revenues were derived from clients in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. Political or economic instability in Canada, the United Kingdom or Australia could have an adverse impact on our results of operations due to diminished revenues in these countries. Our future revenue, costs of operations and profitability could also be affected by a number of other factors related to our international operations, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a countrys political condition, trade protection measures, licensing and other legal requirements, and local tax or foreign exchange issues. Unanticipated currency fluctuations in the Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Euro or the Australian Dollar could lead to lower reported consolidated results of operations due to the translation of these currencies into U.S. dollars when we consolidate our financial results. We provide ARM and CRM services to our U.S. clients utilizing foreign sources of labor through call centers in Canada, India, the Philippines, Barbados, Antigua, Australia, Panama and Mexico. Any political or economic instability in these countries could result in our having to replace or reduce these labor sources, which may increase our labor costs and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies of the countries in which we operate could increase our cost of doing business in those countries. In addition, we expect to expand our operations into other countries and, accordingly, will face similar risks with respect to the costs of doing business in such countries including as a result of any decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies of such countries. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully hedge our foreign currency exposure in the future. We seek growth opportunities for our business in parts of the world where we have had little or no prior experience. International expansion into new markets with different cultures and laws poses additional risks and costs, including the risk that we will not be able to obtain the required permits, comply with local laws and regulations, hire, train and maintain a workforce, and obtain and maintain physical facilities in a culture and under laws that we are not familiar with. In addition, we may have to customize certain of our collection techniques to work with a different consumer base in a different regulatory environment. Also, we may have to revise certain of our analytical portfolio techniques as we apply them in different countries. We are dependent on our employees and a higher turnover rate would have a material adverse effect on us. We are dependent on our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified employees. The BPO industry, by its nature, is labor intensive and experiences a high employee turnover rate. Many of our employees receive modest hourly wages and some of these employees are employed on a part-time basis. A higher turnover rate among our employees would increase our recruiting and training costs and could materially adversely impact the quality of services we provide to our clients. If we were unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of employees, we would be forced to limit our growth or possibly curtail our operations. Growth in our business will require us to recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees to meet the needs of our business or to support our growth. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations could be harmed. Any increase in hourly wages, costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could also have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations. 24 Table of Contents The employees at one of our offices voted to join a labor union, which could increase our costs and result in a loss of customers. In February 2006, the employees at our call center in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada voted in favor of joining the B.C. Government and Services Employees Union, and a collective agreement was ratified in the first quarter of 2007. We are currently not aware of any other union organizing efforts at any of our other facilities. Proposed legislation in the United States called the Employee Free Choice Act could make it easier for unions to organize based on card check authorization rather than by secret ballot election and could give third-party arbitrators the ability to impose terms of a collective bargaining agreement upon us and a labor union if we and the union did not agree to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. If our other employees are successful in organizing a labor union at any of our locations, it could further increase labor costs, decrease operating efficiency and productivity in the future, result in office closures, and result in a loss of customers. If we are not able to respond to technological changes in telecommunications and computer systems in a timely manner, we may not be able to remain competitive. Our success depends in large part on our sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems. We use these systems to identify and contact large numbers of debtors and record the results of our collection efforts, as well as to provide customer service to our clients customers. If we are not able to respond to technological changes in telecommunications and computer systems in a timely manner, we may not be able to remain competitive. We have made a significant investment in technology to remain competitive and we anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to do so in the future. Telecommunications and computer technologies are changing rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles, so we must anticipate technological developments. If we are not successful in anticipating, managing, or adopting technological changes on a timely basis or if we do not have the capital resources available to invest in new technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. We are highly dependent on our telecommunications and computer systems. As noted above, our business is highly dependent on our telecommunications and computer systems. These systems could be interrupted by terrorist acts, natural disasters, power losses, computer viruses, or similar events. Our business is also materially dependent on services provided by various local and long distance telephone companies. If our equipment or systems cease to work or become unavailable, or if there is any significant interruption in telephone services, we may be prevented from providing services and collecting on accounts receivable portfolios we have purchased. Because we generally recognize revenue and generate operating cash flow primarily through ARM collections and providing CRM services, any failure or interruption of services and collections would mean that we would continue to incur payroll and other expenses without any corresponding income. An increase in communication rates or a significant interruption in communication service could harm our business. Our ability to offer services at competitive rates is highly dependent upon the cost of communication services provided by various local and long distance telephone companies. Any change in the telecommunications market that would affect our ability to obtain favorable rates on communication services could harm our business. Moreover, any significant interruption in communication service or developments that could limit the ability of telephone companies to provide us with increased capacity in the future could harm existing operations and prospects for future growth. 25 Table of Contents We may seek to make strategic acquisitions of companies. Acquisitions involve additional risks that may adversely affect us. From time to time, we may seek to make acquisitions of businesses that provide BPO services. We may be unable to make acquisitions if suitable businesses that provide BPO services are not available at favorable prices due to increased competition for these businesses. We may have to borrow money, incur liabilities, or sell or issue stock to pay for future acquisitions and we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us, or at all. Additional borrowings and liabilities may have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. If we issue stock for all or a portion of the purchase price for future acquisitions, our stockholders ownership interest may be diluted. Our common stock is not publicly traded and potential sellers may be unwilling to accept equity in a privately held company as payment for the sale of their business. If potential sellers are not willing to accept our common stock as payment for the sale of their business, we may be required to use more of our cash resources, if available, in order to continue our acquisition strategy. Completing acquisitions involves a number of risks, including diverting managements attention from our daily operations, other additional management, operational and financial resources, system conversions and the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition relationships with customers, suppliers and employees. We might not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business or operate the acquired businesses profitably, and we may be subject to unanticipated problems and liabilities of acquired companies. Our success depends on our senior management team and if we are not able to retain them, it could have a materially adverse effect on us. We are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team, including Michael J. Barrist, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. We depend on the services of Mr. Barrist and the other members of our senior management team to, among other things, continue the development and implementation of our growth strategies, and maintain and develop our client relationships. Goodwill and other intangible assets represented 57.8 percent of our total assets at December 31, 2008. If the goodwill or the other intangible assets, primarily our customer relationships and trade name, are deemed to be impaired, we may need to take a charge to earnings to write-down the goodwill or other intangibles to its fair value. Our balance sheet includes goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets of acquired businesses based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Trade name represents the fair value of the NCO name and is an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Other intangibles are composed of customer relationships, which represent the information and regular contact we have with our clients and non-compete agreements. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. The test for impairment uses a fair value based approach, whereby if the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired. The trade name intangible asset is also reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Late in 2008, our ARM and Portfolio Management reporting units experienced a significant reduction in the collectability of both customer-placed and purchased accounts receivable resulting from deteriorating economic conditions. Due to the expected impact of the economic environment, we reduced 26 Table of Contents our 2009 budgeted expectations for each of our reporting units. As a result, our 2008 annual impairment test for goodwill and trade name indicated that the carrying values of all of our reporting units exceeded their fair values, and we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $275.5 million and trade name impairment charges of $14.0 million. If our goodwill or trade name are deemed to be further impaired, we will need to take an additional charge to earnings in the future to write-down the asset to its fair value. We make significant assumptions to estimate the future revenue and cash flows used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. These assumptions include future growth rates, profitability, discount factors, market comparables, future tax rates, and other factors. Variations in any of these assumptions could result in materially different calculations of impairment amounts. If the expected revenue and cash flows are not realized, additional impairment losses may be recorded in the future. Our other intangibles, consisting of customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For example, the loss of a larger client could require a review of the customer relationship for impairment. We made significant assumptions to estimate the future cash flows used to determine the fair value of the customer relationship. If we lost a significant customer relationship, the future cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship would be less than the carrying amount, and an impairment loss may be recorded. As of December 31, 2008, our balance sheet included goodwill, trade name and other intangibles that represented 33.2 percent, 5.0 percent and 19.6 percent of total assets, respectively, and 216.3 percent, 32.7 percent and 128.0 percent of stockholders equity, respectively. Security and privacy breaches of the systems we use to protect personal data could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our databases contain personal data of our clients customers, including credit card and healthcare information. Any security or privacy breach of these databases could expose us to liability, increase our expenses relating to the resolution of these breaches and deter our clients from selecting our services. Our data security procedures may not effectively counter evolving security risks, address the security and privacy concerns of existing or potential clients or be compliant with federal, state, and local laws and regulations in all respects. Any failures in our security and privacy measures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results and comply with the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could adversely affect our business and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, referred to as Section 404, we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our managements report on internal control over financial reporting and, beginning in fiscal 2009, our registered public accounting firms attestation report on our managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. While we have reported no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, we cannot guarantee that we will not have any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses reported by our independent registered public accounting firm in the future. Compliance with the requirements of Section 404 is expensive and time-consuming. If in the future we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a 27 Table of Contents loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, any failure to establish an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential investors and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could adversely affect our business. Terrorist attacks, war and threats of attacks and war may adversely impact our results of operations, revenue and profitability. Terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad, as well as war and threats of war or actual conflicts involving the United States or other countries in which we operate, may adversely impact our operations, including affecting our ability to collect our clients accounts receivable. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease. They could also result in an adverse effect on the economies of the United States and other countries in which we operate. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, collections and revenue. Risks Related to Our ARM Business We are subject to business-related risks specific to the ARM business. Some of those risks are: Most of our ARM contracts do not require clients to place accounts with us, may be terminated on 30 or 60 days notice, and are on a contingent fee basis. We cannot guarantee that existing clients will continue to use our services at historical levels, if at all. Under the terms of most of our ARM contracts, clients are not required to give accounts to us for collection and usually have the right to terminate our services on 30 or 60 days notice. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that existing clients will continue to use our services at historical levels, if at all. In addition, most of these contracts provide that we are entitled to be paid only when we collect accounts. Therefore, for these contracts, we can only recognize revenues upon the collection of funds on behalf of clients. If we fail to comply with government regulation of the collections industry, it could result in the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct business. The collections industry is regulated under various U.S. federal and state, Canadian, United Kingdom and Australian laws and regulations. Many states, as well as Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, require that we be licensed as a debt collection company. The Federal Trade Commission, referred to as the FTC, has the authority to investigate consumer complaints against debt collection companies and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in fines as well as the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct collections, which would materially adversely affect us. State regulatory authorities have similar powers. If such matters resulted in further investigations and subsequent enforcement actions, we could be subject to fines as well as the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct collections, which would materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, new federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, or changes in the ways these rules or laws are interpreted or enforced, could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. If we expand our international operations, we may become subject to additional government controls and regulations in other countries, which may be stricter or more burdensome than those government controls and regulations to which we are currently subject. 28 Table of Contents Several of the industries we serve are also subject to varying degrees of government regulation. Although our clients are generally responsible for complying with these regulations, we could be subject to various enforcement or private actions for our failure, or the failure of our clients, to comply with these regulations. Risks Related to Our CRM Business We are subject to business-related risks specific to the CRM business. Some of those risks are: Consumer resistance to outbound services could harm the CRM services industry. As the CRM services industry continues to grow, the effectiveness of CRM services as a direct marketing tool may decrease as a result of consumer saturation and increased consumer resistance to customer acquisition activities, particularly direct sales and telemarketing. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our CRM services. The CRM division relies on a few key clients for a significant portion of its revenues. The loss of any of these clients or their failure to pay us could reduce revenues and adversely affect results of operations. The CRM division is characterized by substantial revenues from a few key clients. While no individual CRM client represented more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue, we are exposed to customer concentration within this division. Most of these clients are not contractually obligated to continue to use our services at historic levels or at all. If any of these clients were to significantly reduce the amount of service, fail to pay, or terminate the relationship altogether, our CRM business could be harmed. Government regulation of the CRM industry and the industries we serve may increase our costs and restrict the operation and growth of our CRM business. The CRM services industry is subject to an increasing amount of regulation in the United States and Canada. In the United States, the FCC places restrictions on unsolicited automated telephone calls to residential telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems, prerecorded or artificial voice messages and telephone fax machines, and requires CRM firms to develop a do not call list and to train their CRM personnel to comply with these restrictions. The FTC regulates both general sales practices and telemarketing specifically and has broad authority to prohibit a variety of advertising or marketing practices that may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Most of the statutes and regulations in the United States allow a private right of action for the recovery of damages or provide for enforcement by the FTC, state attorneys general or state agencies permitting the recovery of significant civil or criminal penalties, costs and attorneys fees in the event that regulations are violated. The Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission enforces rules regarding unsolicited communications using automatic dialing and announcing devices, live voice and fax. We cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all applicable regulations at all times. We also cannot assure you that new laws, if enacted, will not adversely affect or limit our current or future operations. Several of the industries we serve, particularly the insurance, financial services and telecommunications industries, are subject to government regulation. We could be subject to a variety of private actions or regulatory enforcement for our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these regulations. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if the effect of government regulation of the industries we serve is to reduce the demand for our CRM services or expose us to potential liability. We, and our employees who sell insurance products, are required to be licensed by various state insurance commissions for the particular type of insurance product sold and to participate in regular continuing 29 Table of Contents education programs. Our participation in these insurance programs requires us to comply with certain state regulations, changes in which could materially increase our operating costs associated with complying with these regulations. Risks Related to Our Purchased Accounts Receivable Business We are subject to business-related risks specific to the Purchased Accounts Receivable business. Some of those risks are: Collections may not be sufficient to recover the cost of investments in purchased accounts receivable and support operations. We purchase past due accounts receivable generated primarily by consumer credit transactions. These are obligations that the individual consumer has failed to pay when due. The accounts receivable are purchased from consumer creditors such as banks, finance companies, retail merchants, hospitals, utilities, and other consumer-oriented companies. Substantially all of the accounts receivable consist of account balances that the credit grantor has made numerous attempts to collect, has subsequently deemed uncollectible, and charged off. After purchase, collections on accounts receivable could be reduced by consumer bankruptcy filings. The accounts receivable are purchased at a significant discount, typically less than 10 percent of face value, and, although we estimate that the recoveries on the accounts receivable will be in excess of the amount paid for the accounts receivable, actual recoveries on the accounts receivable will vary and may be less than the amount expected, and may even be less than the purchase price paid for such accounts. In addition, the timing or amounts to be collected on those accounts receivable cannot be assured. If cash flows from operations are less than anticipated as a result of our inability to collect accounts receivable, we may have difficulty servicing our debt obligations and may not be able to purchase new accounts receivable, and our future growth and profitability will be materially adversely affected. We use estimates to report results. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $98.9 million relating to our purchased receivables portfolio. If the amount and/or timing of collections on portfolios are materially different than expected, we may be required to record further impairment charges that could have a materially adverse effect on us. Our revenue is recognized based on estimates of future collections on portfolios of accounts receivable purchased. Although these estimates are based on analytics, the actual amount collected on portfolios and the timing of those collections will differ from our estimates. If collections on portfolios are less than estimated, we may be required to record an allowance for impairment of our purchased receivables portfolio, which could materially adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and creditworthiness. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $98.9 million relating to our purchased receivables portfolio. If we continue to experience adverse effects of the challenging economic and business environment, including changes in financial projections, we may have to recognize further impairment charges on our purchased receivables portfolio. We may be adversely affected by possible shortages of available accounts receivable for purchase at favorable prices. The availability of portfolios of past due consumer accounts receivable for purchase at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the continuation of the current growth trend in consumer debt and competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of portfolios of accounts receivable. The growth in consumer debt may also be affected by changes in credit grantors underwriting criteria and regulations governing consumer lending. Any slowing of the consumer 30 Table of Contents debt growth trend could result in less credit being extended by credit grantors. Consequently, fewer delinquent accounts receivable could be available at prices that we find attractive. If competitors raise the prices they are willing to pay for portfolios of accounts receivable above those we wish to pay, we may be unable to buy the type and quantity of past due accounts receivable at prices consistent with our historic return targets. In addition, we may overpay for portfolios of delinquent accounts receivable, which may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be unable to compete with other purchasers of past due accounts receivable, which may have an adverse effect on our financial results. We face bidding competition in our acquisitions of portfolios of past due consumer accounts receivable. Some of our existing competitors and potential new competitors may have greater financial and other resources that allow them to offer higher prices for the accounts receivable portfolios. New purchasers of such portfolios entering the market also cause upward price pressures. We may not have the resources or ability to compete successfully with our existing and potential new competitors. To remain competitive, we may have to increase our bidding prices, which may have an adverse impact on our financial results. Risks Related to Our Structure We are controlled by an investor group led by One Equity Partners II, L.P., a private equity firm, and its affiliates, whose interests may not be aligned with those of our noteholders. Our equity investors control the election of our directors and thereby have the power to control our affairs and policies, including the appointment of management, the issuance of additional stock, stock repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends. In addition, our equity investors must consent to the entering into of mergers, sales of substantially all our assets and certain other transactions. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of our equity investors could be in conflict with those of our noteholders. For example if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, our equity investors might pursue strategies that favor equity investors over our debt investors. One Equity Partners may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transaction might involve risk to our noteholders. Additionally, One Equity Partners is not prohibited from making investments in any of our competitors. 31 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements included or incorporated by reference into this prospectus, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder), which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby.

Generally, under the agreements governing the notes and bank indebtedness, we are prohibited from entering into transactions with affiliates except upon terms that, taken as a whole, are materially not less favorable to us than could be obtained, at the time of such transaction, in a comparable arms-length transaction with a person that is not such an affiliate. Management Agreement On November 15, 2006, we entered into a ten-year management agreement with One Equity Partners pursuant to which One Equity Partners provides business and organizational strategy and financial advisory services. One Equity Partners is our principal shareholder. Messrs. Rubin, Selmonosky and Shoeb, our directors from 2006 until March 2008, were Managing Directors at One Equity Partners. Mr. Cashin, our director from 2006 until March 2009, is Managing Partner of One Equity Partners. Of our current directors, Messrs. Cohen and Farmer are Managing Directors of One Equity Partners and Mr. Briance is a Vice President of One Equity Partners. Pursuant to the management agreement, we pay One Equity Partners $3.0 million per annum plus reimbursement of expenses. In addition, at the closing of the Transaction, we paid One Equity Partners a transaction fee of $18.8 million. We do not know, and cannot determine, the approximate dollar value of the interest of each of Messrs. Rubin, Selmonosky, Shoeb, Cashin, Cohen, Farmer and Briance in the management fees and transaction fee that we paid to One Equity Partners. We do not separately compensate One Equity Partners or its designated representatives on our Board of Directors for their services as directors, but One Equity Partners may receive fees in connection with its role in specific transactions in the future.

Morgan Securities Inc. to continue its market making activities with respect to the notes. Systems & Services Technologies, Inc. In January 2008, we acquired Systems & Services Technologies, Inc., or SST, a third-party consumer receivable servicer, for $17.7 million consisting of a cash payment of $10.6 million and the issuance of 29,884.7 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.

The entering into the senior credit facility was made in the ordinary course of business. The senior credit facility consists of substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing for comparable transactions for unrelated parties, and does not involve more than the normal risk of uncollectibility or present other unfavorable features. Registration Rights Agreement In connection with the Transaction, on November 15, 2006, we also entered into customary registration rights agreements with the placement agents of the outstanding notes, for the benefit of the holders of the outstanding notes. The registration rights agreements provide that so long as J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. proposes to make a market in the notes as part of its business in the ordinary course, we must, within certain time periods, file a market making registration statement and, subject to certain exceptions, keep the related prospectus current in order to enable J.P.

Transactions with Certain Clients Affiliates of Citigroup are investors in us, and Citigroup is a client of ours. For the periods from January 1, 2006 through November 15, 2006 and July 13, 2006 through December 31, 2006, we received fees for providing services to Citigroup of $28.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, we received fees for providing services to Citigroup of $33.5 million and $69.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008, we had accounts receivable of $3.3 million due from Citigroup. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we purchased accounts receivable with a face value of $32.3 million for a purchase price of $1.4 million from an affiliate of Citigroup. Use of Airplane From January 1, 2006 through November 15, 2006, Mr. Barrists compensation included the personal use by Mr. Barrist of 25 hours per year of an aircraft partly owned by us. Mr. Barrist reimbursed us $203,000 for the period from January 1, 2006 through November 15, 2006 for his personal use of the aircraft in excess of 25 hours based on our actual operating costs plus the hourly cost equivalent for the monthly management fee, interest and depreciation. In addition, during 2006, Mr. Barrist was charged $47,881 for taxes, calculated under the Standard Industry Fare Level, or SIFL, and we were not entitled to a tax deduction of $153,739 for such personal usage. Under Mr. Barrists new employment agreement, which was effective on November 15, 2006, Mr. Barrist is entitled to 150 hours per year on the aircraft for both business and personal use, as determined by Mr. Barrist in his discretion. Transactions with PSC Eric S. Siegel, one of NCOs directors prior to the Transaction, was a director of PSC Info Group, or PSC, a provider of outsourced mail services and related document management services. Until August 2006, Mr. Siegel also owned less than one percent of the outstanding common stock of PSC and provided nonoperational consulting services to PSC. We paid PSC a total of $27.3 million between January 1, 2006 and August 2006, for producing and mailing collection letters, which we believe was comparable to or less than other mail outsourcing companies would charge for similar volumes of business. Mr. Siegel was not involved in the negotiation or the administration of NCOs contract with PSC. PSC was sold to a purchaser not affiliated with Mr. Siegel in August 2006 and Mr. Siegel ceased being a shareholder of PSC. 38 Table of Contents Employment of Related Persons We employ Brett Leckerman as a general manager of one of our collection units. Mr. Leckerman received salary and bonus totaling $133,207 in 2006, $133,067 in 2007 and $139,208 in 2008. Mr. Leckerman also received an automobile allowance in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Mr. Leckerman is the son of Steven Leckerman, an executive officer of ours. We believe that the compensation paid to Mr. Brett Leckerman was comparable with compensation paid to other employees with similar levels of responsibility and years of service. Other Arrangements One Equity Partners is managed by OEP Holding Corporation, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase & Co., referred to as JPM, and JPM is a client of ours. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, we received fees for providing services to JPM of $6.9 million, $10.0 million and $14.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008, we had accounts receivable of $9,000 due from JPM. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of JPM, is a lender under our Credit Facility. The Credit Facility consists of substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing for comparable transactions for unrelated parties, and does not involve more than the normal risk of uncollectibility or present other unfavorable features. 39 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY Senior Secured Credit Facilities Summary In connection with the Transaction, we entered into a senior credit facility consisting of a $465.0 million term credit facility and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (which included a $20.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $20.0 million swingline loan sub-facility), with a syndicate of financial institutions. The borrowers under our senior credit facility are NCO Group, Inc. and NCO Financial Systems, Inc. From time to time, we may, with the consent of the administrative agent under the senior credit facility (which consent is not to be unreasonably withheld), designate one or more guarantors that are U.S. persons to become additional co-borrowers under the revolving credit facility. The full amount of the term credit facility was available at the closing of the Transaction and was used as one of the sources of funds to pay NCOs former shareholders cash consideration for their shares in the Transaction, pay transaction fees and expenses and refinance certain indebtedness of NCO. In connection with the acquisition of OSI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 11, 2007, the senior credit facility was amended to provide an additional $139.0 million term B loan. The full amount of the additional term B loan was available at the closing of the amendment and was used as one of the sources of funds to pay for the merger. OSI and several of its direct and indirect subsidiaries were joined as guarantors to the senior credit facility. As a result of the expected impact of the deteriorating economic conditions on our 2009 financial results, as well as financial covenant ratio adjustments required under the senior credit facility in 2009, we became uncertain of our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants through 2009. Therefore, on March 25, 2009, we amended the senior credit facility to, among other things: (i) adjust the financial covenants, including increasing maximum leverage ratios, decreasing minimum interest coverage ratios, and increasing maximum capital expenditure limitations; (ii) increase the margin applicable to base rate borrowings and LIBOR borrowings by 0.75 percent; (iii) create a minimum LIBOR of 2.50 percent; (iv) create a minimum base rate of LIBOR plus 1.00 percent; (v) increase the letter-of-credit subfacility to $30.0 million; (vi) permit us under certain circumstances to increase the size of our revolving credit facility by up to $50.0 million in the aggregate; and (vii) limit our ability to invest in purchased accounts receivable under certain circumstances. Following the amendment, and after giving effect to the repayment of certain amounts owed under the senior credit facility with the proceeds of an equity sale, as of March 25, 2009, the balance outstanding on the term loan was $573.6 million and the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility was $47.5 million. The availability of the revolving credit facility is reduced by any unused letters of credit. We had $35.0 million of remaining availability under the revolving credit facility as of March 25, 2009. The amendment to the senior credit facility also permits us to repurchase the notes out of the net cash proceeds of new equity issuances. We are aware that the notes are currently trading at a substantial discount to their face amounts. We or our stockholders may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding notes through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Our stockholders who acquire such notes may seek to contribute them to us, for retirement, in exchange for the issuance of additional equity. The amounts involved may be material. 40 Table of Contents All obligations under our senior credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, including the newly acquired OSI subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions, exclusions and release mechanisms.

The term loan facility will mature on May 15, 2013. The outstanding principal balance of the term loan is due and payable on such date. Certain Covenants and Events of Default Under the senior credit facility credit agreement, we are required to comply, on a quarterly basis, with a maximum leverage ratio covenant (total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA) and a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant (consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense).

The senior notes and the senior subordinated notes are not considered to be of the same class for any purpose, including consents, amendments, waivers or notices. In this description, whenever reference is made to the notes in the context of the rights of holders of the notes, such reference is intended to refer to only those notes issued under the relevant indenture, as supplemented (as defined below) to which the description herein relates. The senior notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of November 15, 2006, referred to as the senior indenture, among NCO Group, Inc. as issuer of the senior notes, the Initial Subsidiary Guarantors, as subsidiary guarantors and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the Senior Trustee). The senior subordinated notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of November 15, 2006, referred to as the senior subordinated indenture and, together with the senior indenture, referred to as the indentures, among NCO Group, Inc., as issuer of the senior subordinated notes, the Initial Subsidiary Guarantors, as subsidiary guarantors, and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the Senior Subordinated Trustee and, together with the Senior Trustee, the Trustees). Any references herein to a Trustee means the Senior Trustee and/or the Senior Subordinated Trustee, and to an indenture means the senior indenture and/or the senior subordinated indenture, in each case as the context may require. The terms of the notes include those stated in the indentures and those made part of the indentures by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The following is a summary of the material provisions of the indentures but does not restate the indentures in their entirety. You can find the definitions of certain capitalized terms used in the following summary under the caption Definitions. We urge you to read the indentures because they, and not this description, define the rights of Holders of the notes. The indentures are exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. For purposes of this Description of Notes, the term Issuer means NCO Group, Inc. and its successors under the indentures, excluding its subsidiaries. We refer to the Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantor individually as an Obligor and to the Issuer and all Subsidiary Guarantors collectively as Obligors. General Senior Notes The senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer that were initially limited to $165.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity. The senior notes will mature on November 15, 2013. Subject to the covenants described below under Covenants, applicable law and certain restrictions under the Credit Agreement, the Issuer may issue additional senior notes (Additional Senior Notes) under the senior indenture. The senior notes and any Additional Senior Notes would be treated as a single class for all purposes under the senior indenture. The senior notes bear interest at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to LIBOR plus 4.875%, as determined by the calculation agent (the Calculation Agent), which initially shall be the Trustee. Interest on the senior notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, commencing on February 15, 2007. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1. Interest on the senior notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including November 15, 2006. 45 Table of Contents Determination Date, with respect to an Interest Period, will be the second London Banking Day preceding the first day of such Interest Period. Interest Period means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period commenced on and included November 15, 2006 and ended on and included February 14, 2007. LIBOR, with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period beginning on the second London Banking Day after the Determination Date that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Determination Date. If Telerate Page 3750 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such banks offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in U.S. dollars for a three-month period beginning on the second London Banking Day after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in New York City, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such banks rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the second London Banking Day after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. London Banking Day is any day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted or, with respect to any future date, are expected to be transacted in the London interbank market. Representative Amount means a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. Telerate Page 3750 means the display designated as Page 3750 on the Moneyline Telerate service (or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service). The amount of interest for each day that the senior notes are outstanding (the Daily Interest Amount) will be calculated by dividing the interest rate in effect for such day by 360 and multiplying the result by the principal amount of the senior notes. The amount of interest to be paid on the senior notes for each Interest Period will be calculated by adding the Daily Interest Amounts for each day in the Interest Period. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)) and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards). The interest rate on the senior notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. 46 Table of Contents The Calculation Agent will, upon the request of any Holder of senior notes, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the senior notes. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent in the absence of manifest error will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Holders of the senior notes. Senior Subordinated Notes The senior subordinated notes are general unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Issuer that were initially limited to $200.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity. The senior subordinated notes will mature on November 15, 2014. Subject to the covenants described below under Covenants, applicable law and certain restrictions under the Credit Agreement, the Issuer may issue additional senior subordinated notes (Additional Senior Subordinated Notes and, together with Additional Senior Notes, Additional Notes) under the senior subordinated indenture. The senior subordinated notes, any exchange notes issued in exchange for the senior subordinated notes and any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes would be treated as a single class for all purposes under the senior subordinated indenture. The senior subordinated notes will initially bear interest at the rate of 11.875% per annum from November 15, 2006 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid. Interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest will be paid to Holders of record at the close of business on May 1 or November 1 immediately preceding the interest payment date. Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Transfer or Exchange of Notes The notes may be exchanged or transferred at the office or agency of the Issuer in The Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. Initially, the corporate trust office of the Trustee at 101 Barclay Street, 8th Floor West, New York, New York 10286 will serve as such office. If you give the Issuer wire transfer instructions, the Issuer will pay all principal, premium and interest on your notes in accordance with your instructions. If you do not give the Issuer wire transfer instructions, payments of principal, premium and interest will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent which will initially be the Trustee, unless the Issuer elects to make interest payments by check mailed to the Holders. The notes were issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 of principal amount and multiples of $1,000. See Book-Entry; Delivery and Form. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of notes, but the Issuer or Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Optional Redemption Ordinary Redemption Senior Notes The Issuer may redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part. The redemption price for the senior notes (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) will be as follows, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on November 15 of any year set forth below: 47 Table of Contents Year Redemption Price 2008 102 % 2009 101 % 2010 and thereafter 100 % Senior Subordinated Notes The Issuer may redeem the senior subordinated notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after November 15, 2010.

Such Make-Whole Redemption may be made upon notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holders registered address not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Make-Whole Redemption Date. The Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of such price and performance of the Issuers obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another person. Redemption with Proceeds of Certain Equity Offerings The senior subordinated indenture provides that, at any time prior to November 15, 2009, the Issuer may, on any one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes issued under the senior subordinated indenture with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent (to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds have been contributed to the equity capital of the Issuer, in amounts equal to the portion of the total redemption price paid by the Issuer) or of the Issuer at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 111.875% plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date; provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes originally issued on November 15, 2006 remains outstanding after each such redemption and notice of any such redemption is mailed within 90 days of each such sale of Capital Stock. General The Issuer will give not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days notice of any redemption. If less than all of the senior notes or senior subordinated notes are to be redeemed, selection of the notes of such series for redemption will be made by the Trustee: · in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such series of notes are listed, or 48 Table of Contents · if such series of notes are not listed on a national securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate. However, no note of $2,000 in principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such note will state the portion of the principal amount to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued upon cancellation of the original note. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the relevant series of notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. Mandatory Redemption The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes. Guarantees Payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes will be Guaranteed, jointly and severally, (x) on a senior basis with respect to the Obligors obligations under the senior indenture and (y) on a senior subordinated basis with respect to the Obligors obligations under the senior subordinated indenture, in each case by the Subsidiary Guarantors. Each Guarantee of the senior subordinated notes is subordinated to the Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor on the same basis as the payments by the Issuer on the senior subordinated notes are subordinated to prior payment on Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer. In addition, each future Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) that will Guarantee any Indebtedness will Guarantee the payment of the principal of, premium if any, and interest on the notes. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable Federal or state laws. Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Note Guarantee will be entitled to contribution from any other Subsidiary Guarantor, or the Issuer, as the case may be. The Note Guarantee issued by any Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) any sale, exchange or transfer to any Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of (A) that number of shares of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor resulting in such Subsidiary Guarantor no longer being a Subsidiary of the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary, or (B) all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor; (2) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, in each case, in compliance with the terms of the indentures; or (3) the release or discharge of the Guarantee which resulted in the creation of such Subsidiary Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee.

No direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of the Issuer on account of Senior Subordinated Indebtedness (other than with the money, securities or proceeds held under any defeasance trust established in accordance with the senior subordinated indenture), whether pursuant to the terms of the senior subordinated notes or upon acceleration or otherwise, shall be made if, at the time of such payment, there exists a default in the payment of all or any portion of the obligations on any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and such default shall not have been cured or waived beyond any applicable grace period or the benefits of this sentence waived by or on behalf of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. In addition, during the continuance of any other event of default with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated, upon receipt by the Senior Subordinated Trustee of written notice from the trustee or other representative for the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness (or the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Designated Senior Indebtedness then outstanding), no payment of Senior Subordinated Indebtedness (other than with the money, securities or proceeds held under any defeasance trust established in accordance with the Senior 52 Table of Contents Subordinated Indenture) may be made by or on behalf of the Issuer upon or in respect of the senior subordinated notes for a period (a Payment Blockage Period) commencing on the date of receipt of such notice and ending 179 days thereafter (unless, in each case, such Payment Blockage Period shall be terminated by written notice to the Senior Subordinated Trustee from such trustee of, or other representatives for, such holders or by payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or such event of default has been cured or waived). Not more than one Payment Blockage Period may be commenced with respect to the senior subordinated notes during any period of 360 consecutive days. No event of default (other than an event of default pursuant to the financial maintenance covenants under the Credit Agreement) that existed or was continuing (it being acknowledged that any subsequent action that would give rise to an event of default pursuant to any provision under which an event of default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new event of default for this purpose) on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or shall be made, the basis for the commencement of a second Payment Blockage Period by the representative for, or the holders of, such Designated Senior Indebtedness, whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days, unless such event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days. To the extent any payment of Senior Indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of the Issuer, as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. To the extent the obligation to repay any Senior Indebtedness is declared to be fraudulent, invalid, or otherwise set aside under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then the obligation so declared fraudulent, invalid or otherwise set aside (and all other amounts that would come due with respect thereto had such obligation not been so affected) shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as Senior Indebtedness for all purposes hereof as if such declaration, invalidity or setting aside had not occurred. Covenants Overview In the indentures, the Issuer agreed to covenants that limit its and its Restricted Subsidiaries ability, among other things, to: · incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; · pay certain dividends, acquire shares of capital stock, make payments on subordinated debt or make investments; · place limitations on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries; · issue or sell capital stock of Restricted Subsidiaries; · guarantee indebtedness; · sell or exchange assets; 53 Table of Contents · enter into transactions with affiliates; · create certain liens; · engage in unrelated businesses; and · consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In addition, if a Change of Control occurs, each Holder of notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or a part of the Holders notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus any accrued interest to the date of repurchase. Covenant Suspension During any period of time that the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from the Required Rating Agencies, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following provisions of the Indenture: · Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock, · Limitation on Layering, · Limitation on Restricted Payments, · Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries, · Limitation on the Issuance and Sale of Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, · Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates, · Limitation on Asset Sales, · Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control, and · clause (3) of the first paragraph and the third paragraph of Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets. (collectively, the Suspended Covenants). In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the preceding sentence and, subsequently, a Required Rating Agency withdraws its rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the notes so that the notes no longer have Investment Grade Ratings from the Required Rating Agencies, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to any incurrences, actions or other events undertaken by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from that time forward, and compliance with the Suspended Covenants with respect to Restricted Payments made after the time of such withdrawal or downgrade will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the covenant described below under Limitation on Restricted Payments as though such covenant had been in effect during the entire period of time from November 15, 2006. 54 Table of Contents Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock (a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (other than the notes and the Note Guarantees existing on November 15, 2006, the exchange notes and the related Guarantees thereof and Indebtedness existing on November 15, 2006) and the Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Issuer may Incur Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Acquired Indebtedness) and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Acquired Indebtedness) or issue preferred stock if, after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or issuance of preferred stock and the receipt and application of the proceeds therefrom, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.5:1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (except as specified below) may Incur or issue each and all of the following: (1) additional Indebtedness and letters of credit under the Credit Facilities by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential liability of the Issuer and such Restricted Subsidiary thereunder) (together with refinancings thereof) not to exceed $565.0 million at any one time outstanding less any amount of such Indebtedness permanently repaid as provided under the Limitation on Asset Sales covenant; (2) Indebtedness owed (A) to the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor or (B) to any other Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (x) any event which results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of such Indebtedness (other than to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (2) and (y) if the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the Note Guarantee, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor; (3) Indebtedness or preferred stock issued in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refinance or refund, then outstanding Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness outstanding under clauses (1), (2), (5), (6), (7), (8), (10), (11) and (14) of the second paragraph of part (a) of this Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant and any refinancings thereof) in an amount not to exceed the amount so refinanced or refunded (plus premiums, accrued interest, fees and expenses); provided that (a) Indebtedness the proceeds of which are used to refinance or refund the notes in part or Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to, the notes or a Note Guarantee shall only be permitted under this clause (3) if (x) in case the notes are refinanced in part, such new Indebtedness, by its terms or by the terms of any agreement or instrument pursuant to which such new Indebtedness is outstanding, is expressly made pari passu with, or subordinate in right of payment to, the remaining notes or the Note Guarantee, or (y) in case the Indebtedness to be refinanced is subordinated in right of payment to the notes or a Note Guarantee, such new Indebtedness, by its terms or by the terms of any agreement or instrument pursuant to which such new Indebtedness is issued or remains outstanding, is expressly made subordinate in right of payment to the notes or the Note Guarantee at least to the extent that the Indebtedness to be refinanced is subordinated to the notes or the Note Guarantee, (b) such new Indebtedness, determined as of the date of Incurrence of such new Indebtedness, does not mature prior to the Stated Maturity of the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded, and the Average Life of such new Indebtedness is at least equal to the remaining Average Life of the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded and (c) such new Indebtedness is Incurred by the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor or by the Restricted Subsidiary that is the obligor on the Indebtedness to be refinanced or refunded; provided 55 Table of Contents further that in the case of the Senior Subordinated Indenture, subclauses (a) and (b) of this clause (3) will not apply to any refinancing or refunding of Senior Indebtedness; (4) Indebtedness of the Issuer, to the extent the net proceeds thereof are promptly (A) used to purchase notes tendered in an Offer to Purchase made as a result of a Change in Control or (B) deposited to defease the notes as described under Defeasance or Satisfaction and Discharge; (5) Guarantees of the notes and Guarantees of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries by any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; provided the Guarantee of such Indebtedness is permitted by and made in accordance with the Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees by Restricted Subsidiaries covenant; (6) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently (except in the case of daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the normal course of business provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five business days of Incurrence; (7) Indebtedness in respect of performance bonds, bankers acceptances, workers compensation claims, surety or appeal bonds and payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar obligations (and letters of credit in respect thereof); (8) the Incurrence of, or issuance by, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or preferred stock, in each case, Incurred or issued for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or any part of the purchase price or cost (including, without limitation, the cost of improvement or construction) to acquire or improve real or personal property (including, without limitation acquisitions by way of Capitalized Lease Obligations and acquisitions of the Capital Stock of a Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, to the extent of the fair market value of the real or personal property so acquired, plus goodwill associated therewith) by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after November 15, 2006 provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness or liquidation preference of preferred stock, as applicable, outstanding at any time (together with any refinancing thereof pursuant to this clause (8)) may not exceed $20.0 million; (9) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Guarantor of (x) Acquired Indebtedness, or (y) preferred stock of Persons that are acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (including by way of merger or consolidation) in accordance with the terms of the indentures (provided that such preferred stock is not issued in contemplation of such acquisition or merger); provided further in the case of each of (x) and (y) that the Issuer would, at the time of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Incurrence had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four quarter period, have been permitted to Incur $1.00 of Indebtedness under the first paragraph of part (a) of this covenant; (10) obligations under Currency Agreements and Interest Rate Agreements designed primarily to protect the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and that do not increase the Indebtedness of the obligor outstanding at any time other than as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates or by reason of fees, indemnities and compensation payable thereunder; (11) Indebtedness of any Foreign Subsidiary in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time (together with refinancings thereof pursuant to this clause (11)) not to exceed $15.0 million; 56 Table of Contents (12) Acquired Indebtedness in connection with the consummation of the Transaction on substantially the same terms as described in the offering memorandum dated November 8, 2006 related to the notes; (13) the Incurrence of Indebtedness or the issuance of preferred stock under any Portfolio Management Financing; provided that (i) the amount of Indebtedness Incurred or liquidation preference of preferred stock issued under a Portfolio Management Financing shall not exceed 90% of the total amount paid to acquire the Portfolio Management Assets purchased with the proceeds of such Indebtedness or preferred stock and (ii) at the time of Incurrence or issuance and after giving pro forma effect thereto, the Portfolio Management Leverage Ratio shall not exceed 3.0 to 1; and (14) the Incurrence or issuance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness or preferred stock (in addition to Indebtedness or preferred stock permitted under clauses (1) through (13) above) in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time (together with refinancings thereof pursuant to this clause (14)) not to exceed $50.0 million (which Indebtedness may, but need not, be Incurred, in whole or in part, under the Credit Facilities). (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that may be outstanding pursuant to this Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant will be deemed not to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies. (c) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant, (x) Indebtedness Incurred under the Credit Agreement on November 15, 2006 shall be treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of part (a) of this Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant, (y) Guarantees, Liens or obligations with respect to letters of credit supporting Indebtedness otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount shall not be included and (z) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the Limitations on Liens covenant shall not be treated as Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described above (other than Indebtedness outstanding on November 15, 2006 referred to in clause (x) of the preceding sentence), including under the first paragraph of clause (a), the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may classify, and from time to time may reclassify, such item of Indebtedness. (d) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness. (e) If obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to the Credit Facilities and in accordance with the terms of the indentures, and the letters of credit are issued in support of other Indebtedness, then the Indebtedness represented by such letters of credit shall be deemed not Incurred. (f) The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will be deemed not to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. 57 Table of Contents Limitation on Layering Senior Indenture The senior indenture provides that the Obligors will not Incur any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Obligors unless such Indebtedness is subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes and any related Note Guarantees to the same extent; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to distinctions between categories of Indebtedness that exist by reason of any Liens or Guarantees arising or created in respect of some but not all such Indebtedness. Senior Subordinated Indenture The senior subordinated indenture provides that the Obligors will not Incur any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness unless such Indebtedness is pari passu with, or subordinated in right of payment to, the senior subordinated notes and any related Note Guarantees, in each case, to the same extent, as applicable; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to distinctions between categories of Senior Indebtedness that exist by reason of any Liens or Guarantees arising or created in respect of some but not all such Senior Indebtedness.

For purposes of determining compliance with this Limitation on Restricted Payments covenant, (x) the amount, if other than in cash, of any Restricted Payment shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a board resolution and (y) in the event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Restricted Payments described in the above clauses, including, without limitation, the first paragraph of this 61 Table of Contents Limitation on Restricted Payments covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may order and classify, and from time to time may reclassify, such Restricted Payment if it would have been permitted at the time such Restricted Payment was made and at the time of such reclassification. Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (1) pay dividends or make any other distributions permitted by applicable law on any Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary owned by the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary, (2) repay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary, (3) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary or (4) transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary. The foregoing provisions shall not restrict any encumbrances or restrictions: (1) existing under the Credit Agreement as in effect on November 15, 2006 (or under any Credit Facility, provided that the encumbrances and restrictions in any such Credit Facility taken as a whole are no more restrictive in any material respect than those contained in the Credit Agreement) or the indentures or any other agreements as in effect on November 15, 2006, and any extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements of such agreements; provided that the encumbrances and restrictions in any such extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements taken as a whole are no more restrictive in any material respect than those encumbrances or restrictions that are then in effect and that are being extended, refinanced, renewed or replaced; (2) existing under or by reason of applicable law, rule, regulation or order; (3) existing with respect to any Person or the property or assets of such Person acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, existing at the time of such acquisition and not Incurred in contemplation thereof, which encumbrances or restrictions are not applicable to any Person or the property or assets of any Person other than such Person or the property or assets of such Person so acquired and any extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements thereof; provided that the encumbrances and restrictions in any such extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements taken as a whole are no more restrictive in any material respect than those encumbrances or restrictions that are then in effect and that are being extended, refinanced, renewed or replaced; (4) in the case of clause (4) of the first paragraph of this Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries covenant: (A) that restrict in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is a lease, license, conveyance or contract or similar property or asset, (B) existing by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the indentures, (C) arising or agreed to in the normal course of business, not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, detract from the value of property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or 62 Table of Contents (D) arising under purchase money obligations for property acquired in the normal course of business or Capitalized Lease Obligations; (5) with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries and imposed pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock of, or property and assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries; (6) arising from customary provisions in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale lease-back agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements entered into (i) in the normal course of business or (ii) with the approval of the Issuers Board of Directors, which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are subject to such agreements; (7) on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the normal course of business; (8) arising under agreements (i) governing Indebtedness Incurred by a Foreign Subsidiary in accordance with clause (11) of the second paragraph of part (a) of the Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant or (ii) governing Indebtedness Incurred by a Subsidiary Guarantor after November 15, 2006 in compliance with the first paragraph of part (a) of the Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant (provided that the encumbrances and restrictions in any such agreements taken as a whole are no more restrictive in any material respect than those contained in the agreements described in clause (1) of this paragraph); (9) with respect to a Portfolio Management Subsidiary pursuant to agreements entered into in the normal course of its business; or (10) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of part (a) of the Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant (provided that the encumbrances and restrictions in any such agreements taken as a whole are no more restrictive in any material respect than those contained in the agreements being refinanced). Nothing contained in this Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries covenant shall prevent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from (1) creating, incurring, assuming or suffering to exist any Liens otherwise permitted in the Limitation on Liens covenant or (2) restricting the sale or other disposition of property or assets of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that secure Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries. Limitation on the Issuance and Sale of Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not sell, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to issue or sell, any shares of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary (including, without limitation, options, warrants or other rights to purchase shares of such Capital Stock) except: (1) to the Issuer or a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary; (2) issuances of directors qualifying shares or sales to foreign nationals of shares of Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries that are Foreign Subsidiaries, to the extent required by applicable law; (3) if, immediately after giving effect to such issuance or sale, such Restricted Subsidiary would no longer constitute a Restricted Subsidiary and any Investment in such Person remaining after 63 Table of Contents giving effect to such issuance or sale would have been permitted to be made under the Limitation on Restricted Payments covenant if made on the date of such issuance or sale; (4) sales of common stock or preferred stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of a Restricted Subsidiary issued in compliance with the indentures (including, without limitation, options, warrants or other rights to purchase shares of such common stock), provided, in each case, that the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary applies the Net Cash Proceeds of any such sale in accordance with the Limitation on Asset Sales covenant; or (5) issuances of shares of Capital Stock of a Portfolio Management Subsidiary pursuant to agreements entered into in the normal course of its business. Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees by Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary which is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness (Guaranteed Indebtedness) of the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) unless (a) such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to each indenture providing for a Guarantee (also a Subsidiary Guarantee) of payment of the notes by such Restricted Subsidiary and (b) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Subsidiary Guarantee until the notes have been paid in full. If the Guaranteed Indebtedness is (A) pari passu in right of payment with the notes or any Note Guarantee, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be pari passu in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the Subsidiary Guarantee or (B) subordinated in right of payment to the notes or any Note Guarantee, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to the Subsidiary Guarantee at least to the extent that the Guaranteed Indebtedness is subordinated to the notes or the Note Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary may provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person not a Subsidiary of the Issuer, of (A) that number of shares of the Issuers and each Restricted Subsidiarys Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary resulting in such Restricted Subsidiary no longer being a Subsidiary of the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary, (B) all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary, or (C) upon the designation of such Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, in the case of (A), (B) or (C) above, in accordance with the terms of the indentures; or (2) the release or discharge of the Guarantee which resulted in the creation of such Subsidiary Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such Guarantee, provided that such release or discharge shall not become effective until the receipt by the Trustee of an Officers Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the release and discharge of the Guarantees have been complied with. 64 Table of Contents Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into, renew or extend any transaction (including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of property or assets, or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer, except upon terms that, taken as a whole, are materially not less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary than could be obtained, at the time of such transaction or, if such transaction is pursuant to a written agreement, at the time of the execution of the agreement providing therefor, in a comparable arms-length transaction with a Person that is not such an Affiliate. The foregoing limitation does not limit, and shall not apply to: (1) transactions (A) approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors or, if there is only one disinterested member of the Board of Directors, such member, or (B) for which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the Trustee a written opinion of a nationally recognized investment banking, accounting, valuation or appraisal firm stating that the transaction is fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view; (2) any transaction solely between the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or solely between or among Restricted Subsidiaries; (3) the payment of reasonable and customary regular fees to directors of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries who are not its employees and indemnification arrangements entered into by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries consistent with past practices of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any agreement as in effect or entered into as of November 15, 2006 (as disclosed in the offering memorandum dated November 8, 2006 related to the notes) or any amendment thereto or any transaction contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, pursuant to any amendment thereto) and any replacement agreement thereto so long as any such amendment or replacement agreement is not more disadvantageous to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on November 15, 2006; (7) the issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or for the funding of, employment arrangements, stock option and stock ownership plans or similar employee benefit plans approved by the Board of Directors and loans to employees of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries which are approved by the Board of Directors; (8) (x) the payment by the Issuer to any Affiliate of the Issuer of management fees of not more than $3.0 million or (y) the reimbursement to any such Affiliate of related expenses of not more than $2.0 million, in the case of (x) or (y), in the aggregate in any calendar year; (9) payment of fees and the reimbursement of other expenses to the Existing Stockholders and/or their Affiliates in connection with the Merger-Related Transactions as described in the offering memorandum dated November 8, 2006 related to the notes under the caption Certain Related Party Transactions; 65 Table of Contents (10) loans (or cancellation of loans) or advances to employees in the normal course of business not to exceed $2.0 million in the aggregate at any one time outstanding; (11) transactions with Affiliates that are customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners or purchasers or sellers of goods or services (including, without limitation, relating to portfolios of purchased accounts receivable), in each case which are in the normal course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indentures, and which are fair to the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, or are on terms that, taken as a whole, are materially not less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary than could be obtained, at the time of such transaction or, if such transaction is pursuant to a written agreement, at the time of the execution of the agreement providing therefor, in a comparable arms-length transaction with such a Person that is not such an Affiliate; (12) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of their obligation, if any, or obligations of the Issuer under the terms of, any subscription, registration rights or stockholders agreements, partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary was a party as of November 15, 2006 and which was disclosed in the offering memorandum dated November 8, 2006 related to the notes under the caption Certain Related Party Transactions, provided, however, that the entering into by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after November 15, 2006 will only be permitted by this clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement, taken as a whole, are not materially more disadvantageous to the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, or the holders of the notes, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the Issuer; (13) any financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or any other investment banking, banking or similar services involving the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including without limitation any payments in cash, Capital Stock or other consideration made by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection therewith) on the one hand and the Existing Stockholders and any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, which services (and payments and other transactions in connection therewith) are approved as fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer; or (14) transactions with Persons in their capacity as holder of Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary where such Persons are treated no more favorably than holders of such Indebtedness or Capital Stock generally. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transaction or series of related transactions covered by the first paragraph of this Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates covenant, and not covered by clauses (2) through (14) of this paragraph, (a) the aggregate amount of which exceeds $15.0 million in value, must be approved or determined to be fair in the manner provided for in clause (1)(A) or (B) above and (b) the aggregate amount of which exceeds $40.0 million in value must be determined to be fair in the manner provided for in clause (1)(B) above. 66 Table of Contents Limitation on Liens Senior Indenture The senior indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any of its assets or properties of any character (including, without limitation, any shares of Capital Stock or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary) without contemporaneously making provision to secure the senior notes and the related Note Guarantees equally and ratably with (or, if the obligation or liability to be secured by such Lien is subordinated in right of payment to the senior notes or the related Note Guarantees, prior to) the obligation or liability secured by such Lien. The foregoing limitation does not apply to: (1) Liens to secure Indebtedness Incurred under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount not to exceed $700.0 million and/or securing obligations related thereto under Interest Rate Agreements and Currency Agreements in each case regardless of under which clause of the Limitation of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant such Indebtedness is Incurred; and (2) Permitted Liens. Senior Subordinated Indenture The senior subordinated indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness secured by a Lien (Secured Indebtedness) which is not Senior Indebtedness, without contemporaneously making provision to secure the senior subordinated notes and the related Note Guarantees equally and ratably with (or, if the Secured Indebtedness is subordinated in right of payment to the senior subordinated notes or the related Note Guarantees, prior to) such Secured Indebtedness for so long as such Secured Indebtedness is secured by a Lien. The foregoing limitation does not apply to: (1) Liens securing obligations under the Credit Facilities under clause (1) of the second paragraph of part (a) of the Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant and/or securing obligations related thereto under Interest Rate Agreements and Currency Agreements; (2) Liens securing Senior Indebtedness; or (3) Permitted Liens. Limitation on Asset Sales The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale, unless (1) the consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is at least equal to the fair market value of the assets sold or disposed of and (2) at least 75% of the consideration received consists of (a) cash or Temporary Cash Investments, (b) the assumption of any liabilities, as shown on the Issuers most recent consolidated balance sheet (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes or any Note Guarantee) of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of any other Restricted Subsidiary (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer, or any Affiliate of the Issuer), provided that the Issuer, such Subsidiary Guarantor or such other Restricted Subsidiary is irrevocably and unconditionally released in writing from all such liability or under such 67 Table of Contents Indebtedness, (c) Replacement Assets or (d) a combination of the consideration specified in the foregoing clauses (a) through (c). For the purposes of this provision, any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries into cash or Temporary Cash Investments within 180 days of their receipt by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be cash, but only to the extent of the cash or Temporary Cash Investments received. The Issuer will, or will cause the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) within twelve months after the date of receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale, (A)(i) under the senior indenture, apply an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds to permanently repay secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) under the Senior Subordinated Indenture, apply an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds to permanently repay Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of any other Restricted Subsidiary, in each case described in (i) or (ii) above, owing to a Person other than (x) the Issuer, any Parent or any Subsidiary of the Issuer, or (y) any Existing Stockholder (other than any Person who is a beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of (1) OEP Holdings Corporation or (2) any Person described in clause (a)(y) of the definition of Existing Stockholder), (B) invest an equal amount, or the amount not so applied pursuant to clause (A) (or enter into a definitive agreement committing to so invest within 12 months after the date of such agreement) in Replacement Assets or reduce revolving credit Indebtedness used to finance Replacement Assets within 12 months prior to such Asset Sale, or (C) a combination of the repayment and reinvestment permitted by the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), and (2) apply (no later than the end of the 12-month period referred to in clause (1)) any excess Net Cash Proceeds (to the extent not applied pursuant to clause (1)) as provided in the following paragraphs of this Limitation on Asset Sales covenant. Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture. The amount of such excess Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied (or to be committed to be applied) during such 12-month period as set forth in clause (1) of the third paragraph of this Limitation on Asset Sales covenant and not applied as so required by the end of such period shall constitute Excess Proceeds. If, as of the first day of any calendar month, the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds not theretofore subject to an Offer to Purchase pursuant to this Limitation on Asset Sales covenant totals at least $20.0 million, the Issuer must commence, not later than the fifteenth business day of such month, and consummate, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, an Offer to Purchase from the Holders (and, if required by the terms of any Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes (Pari passu Indebtedness), from the holders of such Pari passu Indebtedness) on a pro rata basis an aggregate 68 Table of Contents principal amount of notes (and Pari passu Indebtedness) equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date, at a purchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus, in each case, accrued interest (if any) to the Payment Date. To the extent that any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Offer to Purchase pursuant to this Limitation on Asset Sales covenant, the Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indentures and the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero. Any repurchase of senior subordinated notes following an Asset Sale will constitute a Restricted Payment under the Senior Subordinated Indenture until the Offer to Purchase relating to the senior notes is completed. See Limitation on Restricted Payments. Limitation on Business Activities The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other than a Permitted Business. Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control The Issuer must commence, within 30 days of the occurrence of a Change of Control, and consummate, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, an Offer to Purchase for all notes then outstanding, at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest (if any) to the payment date. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will have sufficient funds available at the time of any Change of Control to make any debt payment (including, without limitation, repurchases of the notes) required by the foregoing covenant (as well as may be required by the terms of any other securities or indebtedness of the Issuer which might be outstanding at the time). The senior subordinated indenture provides that, prior to complying with any of the provisions of this Change of Control covenant, but in any event within 60 days following a Change of Control, the Issuer will either repay all outstanding Senior Indebtedness or obtain the requisite consents, if any, under all agreements governing outstanding Senior Indebtedness, including, without limitation, the Credit Agreement and the senior indenture, to permit the repurchase of the notes required by this covenant. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of any Offer to Purchase required by this Change of Control covenant on, or as soon as practicable after, the completion of such Offer to Purchase. The Credit Agreement restricts the Issuer from purchasing any notes, and also provides that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer or repurchases of or other prepayments in respect of the notes would constitute a default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the senior indenture prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes upon a Change of Control. Any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders, including lenders under the Credit Agreement and, if applicable, Holders of the senior notes to the purchase of notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In such case, the Issuers failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the indentures which would, in turn, constitute a default under the agreements governing the Issuers other Indebtedness. In such circumstances, the subordination provisions of the indentures would likely restrict payments to the holders of notes. 69 Table of Contents Any repurchase of senior subordinated notes following a Change of Control will constitute a Restricted Payment until the Offer to Purchase relating to the senior notes is completed. See Limitation on Restricted Payments. The Issuer will not be required to make an Offer to Purchase upon the occurrence of a Change of Control if a third party makes an offer to purchase the notes in the manner, at the times and price and otherwise in compliance with the requirements of the indentures applicable to an Offer to Purchase for a Change of Control and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn in such offer to purchase. SEC Reports and Reports to Holders Whether or not the Issuer is then required to file reports with the SEC, from and after the date of consummation of the exchange offers or effectiveness of the shelf registration statement, the Issuer shall file with the SEC all such reports and other information as it would be required to file with the SEC by Section 13(a) or 15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 if it were subject thereto, unless the SEC will not accept any such filings. The Issuer shall supply to the Trustee and to each Holder who so requests or shall supply to the Trustee for forwarding to each such Holder who so requests, without cost to such Holder, copies of such reports and other information. In addition, the Issuer agreed that, at all times prior to the earlier of the date of consummation of the exchange offers or effectiveness of the shelf registration statement and the date that was 270 days after November 15, 2006, the Issuer would, at its cost, deliver to each Holder of the notes quarterly and annual reports substantially equivalent to those which would be required by the Exchange Act. The Issuer could satisfy its obligation to furnish such information to the Trustee and each Holder at any time by filing such information with the SEC. In addition, the Issuer agreed that, at all times prior to the date identified in the preceding sentence, upon the request of any Holder or any prospective purchaser of the notes designated by a Holder, it would supply to such Holder or such prospective purchaser the information required under Rule 144A under the Securities Act. In the event that any Parent provides a Note Guarantee and complies with the requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC, the reports, information and other documents required to be filed and furnished to Holders pursuant to this covenant may, at the option of the Issuer, be filed by and be those of such Parent rather than the Issuer. Events of Default The following events will be defined as Events of Default in the applicable indenture: (a) default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) any note when the same becomes due and payable at maturity, upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise, (whether or not, in the case of the senior subordinated indenture, such payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of such indenture); (b) default in the payment of interest on any note when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a period of 30 days (whether or not, in the case of the senior subordinated indenture, such payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of such indenture); (c) (i) default in the performance or breach of the provisions of the indentures applicable to mergers, consolidations and transfers of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or (ii) the failure by the Issuer to make or consummate an Offer to Purchase in accordance with the provisions under the caption: Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control; 70 Table of Contents (d) the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor defaults in the performance of or breaches any other covenant or agreement in the indentures or under the notes (other than a default specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) above) and such default or breach continues for a period of 60 consecutive days after written notice by the Trustee or the Holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the notes; (e) there occurs with respect to any issue or issues of Indebtedness of the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary having an outstanding principal amount of $30.0 million or more in the aggregate for all such issues of all such Persons, whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, (i) an event of default that has caused the holder thereof to declare such Indebtedness to be due and payable prior to its Stated Maturity and such Indebtedness has not been discharged in full or such acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled within 30 days of such acceleration and/or (ii) the failure to make a principal payment at the final (but not any interim) fixed maturity and such defaulted payment shall not have been made, waived or extended within 30 days of such payment default; (f) any final judgment or order (not covered by insurance or a third party indemnity pursuant to an executed written agreement) for the payment of money in excess of $30.0 million in the aggregate for all such final judgments or orders against all such Persons (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) shall be rendered against the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary and shall not be paid or discharged, and there shall be any period of 60 consecutive days following entry of the final judgment or order during which a stay of enforcement of such final judgments or orders, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect; (g) a court having jurisdiction in the premises enters a decree or order for (A) relief in respect of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, (B) appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or (C) the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary and, in each case, such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; (h) the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (A) commences a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consents to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, (B) consents to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Issuer or such Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer or such Significant Subsidiary or (C) effects any general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (i) any Subsidiary Guarantor repudiates its obligations under its Note Guarantee or, except as permitted by the indentures, any Note Guarantee is determined to be unenforceable or invalid or shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) above that occurs with respect to the Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the indentures, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders), may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the notes to be immediately due and payable. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest shall be immediately due and payable, provided that so long as any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred under the Credit Agreement is outstanding, any such declaration of acceleration under the senior subordinated notes and the senior subordinated indenture shall not become effective until 71 Table of Contents the earlier of (x) five business days after receipt of the acceleration notice by the Bank Agent and the Issuer or (y) acceleration of the Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement; provided further that such acceleration shall be automatically rescinded and annulled without any further action required on the part of the Holders in the event that any and all Events of Default specified in the acceleration notice under the indentures shall have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided in the indentures prior to the expiration of the period referred to in the preceding clauses (x) and (y). In the event of a declaration of acceleration because an Event of Default set forth in clause (e) above has occurred and is continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically rescinded and annulled if the event of default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (e) shall be remedied or cured by the Issuer, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor or the relevant Significant Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 60 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto. If an Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) above occurs with respect to the Issuer, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the notes then outstanding shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Subject to other provisions of the Indentures, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the notes by notice to the Trustee, may waive all past defaults and rescind and cancel a declaration of acceleration and its consequences if (x) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived and (y) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree. For information as to the waiver of defaults, see Modification and Waiver. The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the indentures, that may involve the Trustee in personal liability, or that the Trustee determines in good faith may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of Holders of notes not joining in the giving of such direction and may take any other action it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of notes. A Holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to the indentures or the notes unless: (1) the Holder gives the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default; (2) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder or Holders offer the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any costs, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and (5) during such 60-day period, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes do not give the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with the request. However, such limitations do not apply to the right of any Holder of a note to receive payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on, such note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment, on or after the due date expressed in the note, which right shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder. 72 Table of Contents Officers of the Issuer must certify to the Trustee, on or before a date not more than 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, that a review has been conducted of the activities of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and the Issuers and its Restricted Subsidiaries performance under the indentures and that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries have kept, observed, performed and fulfilled all obligations thereunder, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default and the nature and status thereof. The Issuer will also be obligated to notify the Trustee of any default or defaults in the performance of any covenant, agreement or condition under the indentures. Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets The Issuer will not consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property and assets (as an entirety or substantially an entirety in one transaction or a series of related transactions) to, any Person or permit any Person to merge with or into it unless: (1) the Issuer shall be the continuing Person, or the Person (if other than the Issuer) formed by such consolidation or into which the Issuer is merged or that acquired or leased such property and assets (the Surviving Person) shall be a Person organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America or any jurisdiction thereof and shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all of the obligations of the Issuer under the indentures, the notes and the registration rights agreements, provided that at any time the Surviving Person is a Person other than a corporation, there shall be a co-issuer of the notes that is a corporation that satisfies the requirements of clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (3) either (A) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis the Issuer (or the Surviving Person, if applicable) could Incur at least $1.00 of Indebtedness under the first paragraph of part (a) of the Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant, or (B) the Company (or the Surviving Person, if applicable) would, immediately after giving effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions on a pro forma basis as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four quarter period, have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of not less than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to such transaction; (4) each Subsidiary Guarantor, unless such Subsidiary Guarantor is the Person with which the Issuer, as applicable, has entered into a transaction under this Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets section, shall have, by supplemental indenture amending its Note Guarantee, confirmed that its Note Guarantee shall apply to the obligations of the Issuer, as applicable, or the Surviving Person in accordance with the notes and the indentures; and (5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate (attaching the arithmetic computations to demonstrate compliance with clause (3) of this paragraph) and an opinion of counsel, in each case, stating that such transaction and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with the applicable provisions of the indentures, that all conditions precedent in the indentures relating to such transaction have been satisfied and that such supplemental indenture is enforceable; provided, however , that clause (3) above does not apply if, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, whose determination shall be evidenced by a board resolution, the principal 73 Table of Contents purpose of such transaction is to change the state of incorporation of the Issuer and any such transaction shall not have as one of its purposes the evasion of the foregoing limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not apply to any action taken by the Issuer not involving any other Person (other than in its capacity as a regulatory or legal authority) resulting in the conversion of the Issuer from a corporation to a limited liability company or a limited partnership organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America or any jurisdiction thereof, provided that upon consummation of any such conversion there shall be a co-issuer of the notes that is a corporation that satisfies the requirements of clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant. No Subsidiary Guarantor will consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property and assets (as an entirety or substantially an entirety in one transaction or a series of related transactions) to, any Person or permit any Person to merge with or into it unless: (1) it shall be the continuing Person, or the Person (if other than it) formed by such consolidation or into which it is merged or that acquired or leased such property and assets shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all of such Subsidiary Guarantors obligations under its Note Guarantee and the registration rights agreements; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (3) the Issuer will have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such transaction and such supplemental indenture comply with the applicable provisions of the indentures, that all conditions precedent in the indentures relating to such transaction have been satisfied and that such supplemental indenture is enforceable. The foregoing requirements of this paragraph shall not apply to (x) a consolidation or merger of any Subsidiary Guarantor with and into the Issuer or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, so long as the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, survives such consolidation or merger or (y) the sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person not a Subsidiary of the Issuer, of all of the Issuers and each Restricted Subsidiarys Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, a Subsidiary Guarantor in compliance with the Limitation on Asset Sales covenant, or (z) a reincorporation of a Subsidiary Guarantor if, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Subsidiary Guarantor, whose determination shall be evidenced by a board resolution, the principal purpose of such transaction is to change the state of incorporation of such Subsidiary Guarantor and any such transaction shall not have as one of its purposes the evasion of the foregoing limitations. Defeasance Defeasance and Discharge . The indentures provide that, upon election by the Issuer, the provisions of the indentures will no longer be in effect with respect to the notes (except for, among other matters, certain obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the notes, to replace stolen, lost or mutilated notes, to maintain paying agencies and to hold monies for payment in trust) as of the 123rd day after the deposit referred to below if, among other things: (a) the Issuer has deposited with the Trustee, in trust, money and/or U.S. Government Obligations that through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest 74 Table of Contents on the notes on the Stated Maturity of such payments in accordance with the terms of the indentures and the notes; (b) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee (1) either, (x) an opinion of counsel to the effect that Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the Issuers exercise of its option under this Defeasance provision and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred, which opinion of counsel must be based upon (and accompanied by a copy of) a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service to the same effect unless there has been a change in applicable federal income tax law after November 15, 2006 such that a ruling is no longer required or (y) a ruling directed to the Trustee received from the Internal Revenue Service to the same effect as the aforementioned opinion of counsel and (2) an opinion of counsel to the effect that the creation of the defeasance trust does not violate the Investment Company Act of 1940 and after the passage of 123 days following the deposit, the trust fund will not be subject to the effect of Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or Section 15 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law; (c) immediately after giving effect to such deposit on a pro forma basis, no Event of Default, or event that after the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit, and such deposit shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is bound; (d) with respect to a defeasance of the senior subordinated notes, the Issuer is not prohibited from making payments in respect of the senior subordinated notes by the provisions described under Ranking; and (e) if at such time the notes are listed on a national securities exchange, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the notes will not be delisted as a result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge. Defeasance of Certain Covenants and Certain Events of Default . The indentures further provide that the provisions of the indentures will no longer be in effect with respect to clause (3) of the first paragraph under Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets and all the covenants described herein under Covenants, and clause (c) under Events of Default with respect to such clause (3) of the first paragraph under Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets, clause (d) under Events of Default with respect to such other covenants and clauses (e) and (f) under Events of Default shall be deemed not to be Events of Default upon, among other things, the deposit with the Trustee, in trust, of money and/or U.S. Government Obligations that through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the notes on the Stated Maturity of such payments in accordance with the terms of the indentures and the notes, the satisfaction of the provisions described in clauses (b)(2), (c), (d) and (e) of the preceding paragraph and the delivery by the Issuer to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel to the effect that, among other things, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance of certain covenants and Events of Default and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred. Defeasance and Certain Other Events of Default . In the event that the Issuer exercises its option to omit compliance with certain covenants and provisions of the indentures with respect to the notes as described in the immediately preceding paragraph and the notes are declared due and payable because of 75 Table of Contents the occurrence of an Event of Default that remains applicable, the amount of money and/or U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the notes at the time of their Stated Maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the notes at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default. However, the Issuer will remain liable for such payments and the Issuers obligations or any Subsidiary Guarantors Note Guarantee with respect to such payments will remain in effect. Satisfaction and Discharge The indentures will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the notes, as expressly provided for in the indentures) as to all notes when: (1) either: (A) all of the notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed notes which have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or (B) all notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable pursuant to an optional redemption notice or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year, and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee funds in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes to the date of deposit together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuer directing the Trustee to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be; and (2) the Issuer has paid all other sums payable under the indentures by the Issuer. The Trustee will acknowledge the satisfaction and discharge of the indentures if the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions precedent under the indentures relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indentures have been complied with. Modification and Waiver The indentures may be amended or supplemented, without notice to or the consent of any Holder of senior notes or senior subordinated notes, to: (1) cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the indentures; (2) comply with the provisions described under Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets or Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees by Restricted Subsidiaries; (3) comply with any requirements of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the indentures under the Trust Indenture Act; (4) evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee; (5) add a Subsidiary Guarantor or secure the notes; 76 Table of Contents (6) conform the text of the indentures or the notes to any provision of this Description of Notes; (7) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the indentures as of November 15, 2006; or (8) make any change that, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, does not materially and adversely affect the rights of any Holder. Subject to applicable provisions of the indentures, the indentures may be amended or supplemented by the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes or the senior subordinated notes, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such modification or amendment may, without the consent of each Holder affected thereby: (1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, any note; (2) reduce the principal amount of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any note; (3) change the optional redemption dates or optional redemption prices of the notes from that stated under Optional Redemption; (4) change the place or currency of payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any note; (5) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity (or, in the case of a redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) of any note; (6) waive a default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the notes; (7) release any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from its Note Guarantee, except as provided in the indentures; (8) modify (x) with respect to the senior indenture and the senior notes, the ranking of any senior note or (y) with respect to the senior subordinated indenture and the senior subordinated notes, the subordination provisions of any senior subordinated note, in any case, in a manner adverse to the Holders; or (9) reduce the percentage or aggregate principal amount of notes the consent of whose Holders is necessary for waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the indentures or for waiver of certain defaults. Governing Law The indentures and the notes are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. No Personal Liability of Incorporators, Stockholders, Officers, Directors, or Employees No recourse for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the notes or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of any Obligor in the indentures, or in any of the notes or Note Guarantees or 77 Table of Contents because of the creation of any Indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, Officer, director, employee or controlling person of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor or of any successor Person thereof. Each Holder, by accepting the notes, waived and released all such liability. The waiver and release were part of the consideration for the issuance of the notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws. Concerning the Trustee Except during the continuance of a Default, the Trustee will be liable only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in the indentures. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise of the rights and powers vested in it under the indentures as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of such persons own affairs. The indentures and provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, incorporated by reference therein contain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received by it in respect of any such claims, as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions; provided, however, that if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict or resign. Book-Entry; Delivery and Form The certificates representing the notes were issued in fully registered form without interest coupons. Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act were initially represented by one or more temporary global notes in definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons (each a Temporary Regulation S Global Note) and were deposited with the Trustee as custodian for, and registered in the name of a nominee of, The Depository Trust Company (DTC) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. The Temporary Regulation S Global Note will be exchangeable for one or more permanent global notes (each a Permanent Regulation S Global Note; and together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes, the Regulation S Global Note) on or after the 40th day following November 15, 2006 upon certification that the beneficial interests in such global Note are owned by non-U.S. persons. Prior to the 40th day after November 15, 2006, beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes could only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any resale or transfer of such interests to U.S. persons were not permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer was made pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S. Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A are represented by one or more permanent global notes in definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons (each a Restricted Global Note; and together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the Global Notes) and were deposited with the Trustee as custodian for, and registered in the name of a nominee of, DTC. Each Global Note (and any notes issued for exchange therefor) is subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein. Notes transferred to institutional accredited investors (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) (an Institutional Accredited Investor) who are not qualified institutional buyers (Non- Global Purchasers) will be in registered form without interest coupons (Certificated Notes). Upon the transfer of Certificated Notes initially issued to a Non-Global Purchaser to a qualified institutional buyer or in accordance with Regulation S, such Certificated Notes will, unless the relevant 78 Table of Contents Global Note has previously been exchanged in whole for Certificated Notes, be exchanged for an interest in a Global Note. Ownership of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC (participants) or persons who hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Qualified institutional buyers may hold their interests in a Restricted Global Note directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such system. Investors may hold their interests in a Regulation S Global Note directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. On or after the 40th day following November 15, 2006, investors may also hold such interests through organizations other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are participants in the DTC system. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through DTC. So long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner or holder of a Global Note, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the indentures and the notes. No beneficial owner of an interest in a Global Note will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTCs applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indentures and, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream. Payments of the principal of, and interest on, a Global Note will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Note or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. The Issuer expects that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal or interest in respect of a Global Note, will credit participants accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such Global Note as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. The Issuer also expects that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in such Global Note held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. The Issuer expects that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including, without limitation, the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in a Global Note is credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC will exchange the applicable Global Note for Certificated Notes, which it will distribute to its participants and which may be legended. 79 Table of Contents The Issuer understands that DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a banking organization within the meaning of New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a Clearing Agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Indirect access to the DTC system is available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies and certain other organizations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (indirect participants). Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in a Global Note among participants of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. If DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days, the Issuer will issue Certificated Notes, which may bear a legend, in exchange for the Global Notes. Holders of an interest in a Global Note may receive Certificated Notes, which may bear a legend, in accordance with the DTCs rules and procedures in addition to those provided for under the indentures.

The United States federal income tax considerations set forth below are based upon currently existing provisions of the Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, and current administrative rulings and pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, as of the date of this prospectus. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary view, and no ruling from the IRS has been, or will be, sought on the issues discussed in this summary. Legislative, judicial, or administrative changes or interpretations may be forthcoming that could alter or modify the statements and conclusions set forth herein. Any such changes or interpretations may be retroactive and could affect the tax consequences discussed below. This summary does not address all potential United States federal tax considerations, such as estate and gift tax considerations, that may be relevant to particular holders of exchange notes and does not address foreign, state or local tax consequences. This summary is limited to persons that acquire the notes at issue price within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code and hold the exchange notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary does not address the federal income tax consequences to taxpayers who may be subject to special tax treatment, including, without limitation: · persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; · banks, insurance companies, or other financial institutions; · small business investment companies; · dealers in securities or currencies; · certain former citizens or residents of the United States; · broker-dealers; · partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes; · traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; · United States holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the United States dollar; · tax-exempt organizations; · persons that hold the exchange notes as part of a position in a straddle, or as part of a hedging, conversion, or other integrated investment transaction; or · persons deemed to sell the exchange notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. 104 Table of Contents If a partnership or other entity taxable as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the exchange notes, the United States federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. INVESTOR RELIANCE ON TAX STATEMENTS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE CIRCULAR 230, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL TAX ISSUES CONTAINED OR REFERRED TO HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY YOU, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON YOU UNDER THE CODE, (B) SUCH DISCUSSION IS WRITTEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING BY US OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN AND (C) YOU SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR. THIS SUMMARY OF MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PARTICULAR SITUATION AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX RULES OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY. Consequences to United States Holders United States Holders . The discussion in this section will apply to you if you are a United States holder. A United States holder is a beneficial owner of the notes who or which is: · an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; · a corporation, including any entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; · an estate if its income is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or · a trust if (a) a United States court can exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (b) such trust was in existence and was treated as a United States person on August 20, 1996, and has in effect a valid election to be treated as a domestic trust for United States federal income tax purposes. Stated Interest and Original Issue Discount . If you are a United States holder, stated interest on the notes will be included in gross income by you as ordinary income at the time it accrues or is received in accordance with your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. Thus, if you are on the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, stated interest on the notes will be reportable by you as ordinary income at the time it accrues. If you are on the cash method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, stated interest on the notes will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is received. 105 Table of Contents Because the stated redemption price of the notes will not exceed their issue price by more than a de minimis amount for federal income tax purposes, no portion of the discount on the notes will be reportable by a United States holder as ordinary income on a current basis, unless the United States holder makes an affirmative election to accrue such discount (and all stated interest and any market discount) into income on a constant interest basis. Market Discount and Bond Premium . If a United States holder has purchased a note for an amount less than its adjusted issue price, the difference is treated as market discount. Subject to a de minimis exception, gain realized on the maturity, sale, exchange or retirement of a market discount note will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of any accrued market discount not previously recognized (including in the case of the notes, any market discount accrued on the related note). A United States holder may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues, on either a ratable or constant yield method. In that case, a United States holders tax basis in any such note will increase by such inclusions. An election to include market discount in income currently, once made, will apply to all market discount obligations acquired by the United States holder during the taxable year of the election and thereafter, and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. If a United States holder does not make such an election, in general, all or a portion of such holders interest expense on any indebtedness incurred or continued in order to purchase or carry any such notes may be deferred until the maturity of the note or certain earlier dispositions. Unless a United States holder elects to accrue market discount under a constant yield method, any market discount will accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition of the note to its maturity date. If a United States holder purchased the note for an amount that is greater than its face value, such holder generally may elect to amortize that premium from the purchase date to the maturity date under a constant yield method. Amortizable premium generally can only offset interest income on such note and generally may not be deducted against other income. A United States holders basis in a note will be reduced by any premium amortization deductions. An election to amortize premium on a constant yield method, once made, generally applies to all debt obligations held or subsequently acquired by the holder during the taxable year of the election and thereafter, and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. The rules regarding market discount and bond premium are complex. United States holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of such rules. Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes . If you are a United States holder, you generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, retirement at maturity or other taxable disposition of a note in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash plus the fair market value of all property received on such disposition (except to the extent such cash or property is attributable to accrued interest not previously included in gross income, which is treated as ordinary income) and your adjusted tax basis in the note. In general, your adjusted tax basis in a note will be equal to the price paid for the note increased by the amounts of any market discount previously included in income by you and reduced by any amortized bond premium deducted, and by any principal payments received, by you. In general, gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note will be capital gain or loss, except to the extent of any accrued market discount which you have not previously included in income, and will generally be long- term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note has been held for more than one year. Long term capital gains of individuals generally are eligible for reduced rates of United States federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding . You may be subject to backup withholding, currently at a rate of twenty-eight percent (28%), with respect to certain reportable payments, including 106 Table of Contents interest payments and, under certain circumstances, principal payments on the notes and payments of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of notes, if you, among other things: · fail to furnish a social security number or other taxpayer identification number certified under penalties of perjury within a reasonable time after the request for the taxpayer identification number; · furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number; · fail to report interest properly; or · under certain circumstances, fail to provide a certified statement, signed under penalties of perjury, that the taxpayer identification number furnished is the correct number and that you are not subject to back-up withholding imposed by the IRS. Backup Withholding is Not An Additional Tax . Any amount withheld from a payment to you under the backup withholding rules is creditable against your income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund provided that the requisite information is timely furnished to the IRS. We will report to you and to the IRS the amount of any reportable payments for each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld, if any, with respect to the reportable payments. Consequences to Non-United States Holders Non-United States Holders . The discussion in this section will apply to you if you are a Non-United States holder. A Non-United States holder is a beneficial owner of the notes that is neither a United States holder as defined in Consequences to United States HoldersUnited States Holders above nor a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Interest Income . If you are a Non-United States holder, interest paid or accrued on the notes will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax if the interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by you and each of the following conditions are met: · you do not actually or constructively own 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock; · you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us through stock ownership; · you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and · either (A) you certify, under penalties of perjury and in a statement provided to us or our paying agent (on IRS Form W-8BEN or substitute form), that you are not a United States person and provide your name and address or (B) a securities clearing organization, bank, or other financial institution that holds customers securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it or a qualified intermediary has received the certification and information described in (A) above from you and furnishes us or our paying agent with a copy thereof. If you do not qualify for an exemption from United States federal withholding tax under this paragraph, then, unless interest on the notes is effectively connected with your conduct of a United States 107 Table of Contents trade or business (as discussed below), interest on the notes will be subject to United States federal withholding tax at a rate of 30 percent, or such lower rate as may be provided for in an applicable income tax treaty. You will be required to provide a United States taxpayer identification number and comply with applicable certification requirements (which certification may be made on IRS Form W-8BEN) if you seek to claim an exemption from, or reduced rate of, withholding under an income tax treaty. Special rules apply in the case of notes held through intermediaries. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the certification requirements for non-United States persons. Gain On Disposition . If you are a Non-United States holder, generally you will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of the notes unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by you (and, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed based maintained by you therein) or (ii) you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 or more days during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met. Effectively Connected Income . If you are a Non-United States holder engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and if interest on the notes (and gain realized on its sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition) is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (or, if a tax treaty applies, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by you therein), you will generally be subject to United States income tax on such effectively connected income in the same manner as if you were a United States holder. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to an additional 30 percent branch profits tax (unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable treaty). If income on the notes held by you is effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business, you will generally be exempt from withholding tax if you provide to us or our withholding agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding . If you are a Non-United States holder, payments of interest to you with respect to which the requisite certification, as described above, has been received (or for which an exemption has otherwise been established) will not be subject to either information reporting or backup withholding, unless we or our paying agent have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person or that the conditions of any other exemption are not in fact satisfied. Information reporting and backup withholding requirements will apply, however, to the gross proceeds paid to you on the disposition of notes by or through a United States office of a United States or foreign broker, unless you certify to the broker under penalties of perjury as to your name, address and status as a foreign person or otherwise establishes an exemption. Information reporting requirements, but generally not backup withholding, will also apply to a payment of the proceeds of a disposition of notes by or through a foreign office of a United States broker or foreign broker with certain types of relationships to the United States unless the broker has documentary evidence in its file that you are not a United States person, and the broker has no actual knowledge or reason to know to the contrary, or you establish an exemption. Neither information reporting nor backup withholding generally will apply to a payment of the proceeds of a disposition of notes by or through a foreign office of a foreign broker not otherwise covered in the immediately preceding sentence. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld from a payment to you under the backup withholding rules is creditable against your actual United States federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund, provided the requisite information is timely furnished to the IRS. 108 Table of Contents ERISA CONSIDERATIONS The notes may not be sold or transferred to, and each purchaser shall be deemed to have represented and covenanted that it is not acquiring the notes for or on behalf of, and will not transfer the notes to, any employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which we refer to as ERISA, a plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, and/or an entity whose underlying assets are considered to include plan assets pursuant to ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, except that such acquisition for or on behalf of such a plan shall be permitted: (i) to the extent such acquisition is made by or on behalf of a bank collective investment fund maintained by the purchaser in which no plan (together with any other plans maintained by the same employer or employee organization) has an interest in excess of 10 percent of the total assets in such collective investment fund, and the other applicable conditions of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 91-38 issued by the Department of Labor are satisfied;

or (vii) to the extent such acquisition will not otherwise give rise to a transaction described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code for which a statutory or administrative exemption is unavailable.

The purchaser agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations or agreements the purchaser is deemed to have made by the acquisition of the notes is no longer accurate, the purchaser will promptly notify us. If the purchaser is acquiring any notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, the purchaser represents that the purchaser has sole investment discretion with respect to each of those accounts and that the purchaser has full power to make the above acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each account. 110 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION This prospectus is to be used by J.P.

A New Jersey corporation shall indemnify a corporate agent against expenses to the extent such corporate agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in any proceeding referred to in Sections 14A:3-5(2) and 14A:3-5(3) or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein. Any indemnification under Section 14A:3-5(2) and, unless ordered by a court, under Section 14A:3-5(3) may be made by the corporation only as authorized in a specific case upon a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the corporate agent met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 14A:3-5(2) or 14A:3-5(3). Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws, such determination shall be made: (a) by the board of directors or a committee thereof, acting by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to or otherwise involved in the proceeding; (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable and such quorum of the board of directors or committee by a majority vote of the disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel, in a written opinion, such counsel to be designated by the board of directors; or (c) by the shareholders if the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or a resolution of the board of directors or of the shareholders so directs.

Further, the bylaws of Compass Teleservices Inc. authorize the Board of Directors to add to the above list of exceptions at any time by resolution. Registrants Incorporated Under the Laws of Arizona Jennifer Loomis & Associates, Inc. is incorporated in the State of Arizona. Section 10-851(A) of the Arizona Revised Statutes (the ARS) authorizes an Arizona corporation to indemnify any person who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal, because either the individual is or was a director and the individuals conduct was in good faith, the individual reasonably believed that, in the case of conduct in an official capacity with the corporation, the conduct was in its best interest, or in all other cases, that the conduct was at least not opposed to its best interests, and in the case of any criminal proceedings, the individual has no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful, or in the case of any criminal proceedings, the individual has no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful, or if the director engaged in conduct for which broader indemnification has been made permissible or obligatory under a provision of the articles of incorporation. Section 10-851(B) states that conduct by an individual who is or was a director of a corporation or an individual who, while a director of a corporation, is or was serving at the corporations request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity, including the estate or personal representative of a director, with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose the director reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan, is presumed to be conduct taken in good faith. Section 10-852(A) requires that an Arizona corporation indemnify an individual who is or was a director of a corporation or an individual who, while a director of a corporation, is or was serving at the corporations request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity, including the estate or personal representative of a director, who was the prevailing party, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal, to which such individual was a party because the individual was or is a director of the corporation against reasonable attorney fees and all other costs and expenses reasonably related to such action. Section 10-852(B) requires that an Arizona corporation indemnify an individual who is a director who, when serving as a director, was not an officer, employee or holder of more than five percent of the outstanding shares of any class of stock of the corporation or of any affiliate of the corporation, unless such indemnification is limited by the articles of incorporation or other provisions of Arizona law. Payment under Section 10-852(B) shall not be made if a court of competent jurisdiction determines before payment that the outside director fails to meet the standards of Section 10-851(A), and does not otherwise order payment pursuant to Section 10-854. II-10 Table of Contents Under Arizona law, indemnification may be provided against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding. The indemnification may be provided, however, only if authorized for a specific proceeding after a determination has been made that indemnification is permissible under the circumstances because the person met the applicable standard of conduct. Pursuant to Section 10-855, this determination is required to be made: · by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not, at the time, parties to the proceeding; · by special legal counsel selected by the board by the vote set forth above, or, if such vote cannot be obtained, by a majority of the entire board; or · by the shareholders, but shares owned by or under the control of directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding shall not be voted on the determination. Section 10-851(D) provides that if the proceeding is won by or in the right of the corporation, indemnification may not be provided as to any proceeding in which the person is found liable to the corporation, and indemnification may not be provided in connection with any other proceeding charging improper financial benefit to the director, whether or not involving action in the directors official capacity, in which the director was adjudged liable on the basis that financial benefit was improperly received by the director. Under Section 10-853, an Arizona corporation may pay, before final disposition, the expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by a director who is a party to a proceeding if the director gives a written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification and a written undertaking to the corporation to repay the amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification. The undertaking does not need to be secured, and the undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the director to repay the advance. Section 10-856 allows for indemnification of an individual who is or was an officer of a corporation or an individual who, while an officer of a corporation, is or was serving at the corporations request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity, including the estate or personal representative of an officer, to the same extent as a director, or if the individual is an officer but not a director, to the further extent as may be provided in the articles of incorporation, bylaws, a resolution of the board of directors or contract, except that no indemnification will be provided for liability in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation other than for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding, or liability that constitutes receipt by the officer of a financial benefit to which the officer is not entitled, an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the shareholders, or an intentional violation of criminal law. Under Section 10-857, the corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any individual who is or was a director or officer of the corporation or who, while a director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity, against liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in that capacity or arising from the individuals status as a director or officer, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the individual against that liability under the applicable law. II-11 Table of Contents In addition to the general indemnification described above, Arizona law permits corporations to include any provision expanding or limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation or its stockholders for money damages, but may not include any provision that restricts or limits the liability of its directors or officers to the corporation or its stockholders: · to the extent that it is proved that the person actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property, or services for the amount of the benefit or profit in money, property or services actually received; or · to the extent that a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the person is entered in a proceeding based on a finding in the proceeding that the persons action, or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding. The bylaws of Jennifer Loomis & Associates, Inc. do not contain indemnification provisions. The articles of incorporation of Jennifer Loomis & Associates, Inc. provide that the indemnification of any person who incurs expenses or liabilities by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an officer, director, employee or agent, or is or was serving at the request of Jennifer Loomis & Associates, Inc. as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be mandatory in all circumstances in which indemnification is permitted by law.

Section 317(d) provides that an agent of the corporation shall be indemnified for expenses incurred in connection with the successful defense on the merits of any proceedings.

Section 317(f) provides that expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay that amount if it shall be determined ultimately that the agent was not entitled to be indemnified. Section 317(i) allows corporations to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agents status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under the applicable law.

II-14 Table of Contents Section 722(c) provides that no such indemnification will be made in respect of a threatened action or a pending action which is settled or otherwise disposed of, or any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action was brought or, if no action was brought, any court of competent jurisdiction determines that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity.

UNDERTAKINGS (a) Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; and (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, if the registrants are subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness; provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (b) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under Securities Act of 1933 of may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of each of the registrants pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrants have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by either of the registrants of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of each of the registrants in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, II-39 Table of Contents each of the registrants will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
