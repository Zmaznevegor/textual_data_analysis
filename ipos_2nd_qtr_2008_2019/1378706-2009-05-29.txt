All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this prospectus regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects and plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “projects,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. Although we believe that the expectations underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, these expectations may prove to be incorrect, and all of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We have included important risks and uncertainties in the cautionary statements included in this prospectus, particularly the section called “Risk Factors” incorporated by reference herein.

We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 4 ABOUT THE COMPANY We distribute and operate on-site cogeneration systems that produce both electricity and heat. Our business is to own the equipment that we install at customers’ facilities and to sell the energy produced by these systems to the customers on a long-term contractual basis. We call this business the American DG Energy “On-Site Utility”. We offer a range of cogeneration systems that are highly reliable and energy efficient. Our cogeneration systems produce electricity from an internal combustion engine driving a generator, while the heat from the engine and exhaust is recovered and typically used to produce heat and hot water for on-site processes. We also distribute and operate water chiller systems that operate in a similar manner, except that the engine’s power drives a large air-conditioning compressor while recovering heat for hot water. Cogeneration systems reduce the amount of electricity that the customer must purchase from the local utility and produce valuable heat and hot water for the site to use as required. The company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on July 24, 2001. American DG Energy operated as a subsidiary of American Distributed Generation Inc. since 2003, along with Tecogen Inc. In December 2005, American DG Energy merged with American Distributed Generation Inc., and the company then changed its name to American DG Energy Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 45 First Avenue, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451. DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on shares of our common stock. We currently intend to retain earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, cash needs and growth plans. USE OF PROCEEDS We will not receive any of the proceeds from the offer and sale of the shares. If the warrants related to the shares of common stock offered for sale pursuant to this prospectus are exercised in full, we will receive aggregate proceeds from such exercises of $465,000.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Section 102 of the Delaware General Corporation Law allows a corporation to eliminate the personal liability of directors of a corporation to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except where the director breached his duty of loyalty, failed to act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated a law, authorized the payment of a dividend or approved a stock repurchase in violation of Delaware corporate law or obtained an improper personal benefit. We have included such a provision in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation has the power to indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation and certain other persons serving at the request of the corporation in related capacities against amounts paid and expenses incurred in connection with an action or proceeding to which he is or is threatened to be made a party by reason of such position, if such person shall have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, in any criminal proceeding, if such person had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful; provided that, in the case of actions brought by or in the right of the corporation, no indemnification shall be made with respect to any matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the adjudicating court determines that such indemnification is proper under the circumstances. Our charter includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of its directors for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability: · for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders; · for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; · under section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding unlawful dividends and stock purchases; or · for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation also provides that: · we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law; · we may, to the extent authorized from time to time by our Board of Directors, indemnify our other employees and agents to the same extent that we indemnified our officers and directors; and · in the event we do not assume the defense in a legal proceeding, we must advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and executive officers in connection with a legal proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. The indemnification provisions contained in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws are not exclusive of any other rights to which a person may be entitled by law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. In addition, we maintain insurance on behalf of our directors and executive officers insuring them against any liability asserted against them in their capacities as directors or officers or arising out of such status. 9 Item 15.

Undertakings Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the company pursuant to the provisions described under “Indemnification of Directors and Officers” above, or otherwise, the company has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the company of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the company in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The company hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the company's annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. The company hereby undertakes that: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: a. To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; b. To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and c. To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 14 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has authorized this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in Waltham, Massachusetts on May 29, 2009.
