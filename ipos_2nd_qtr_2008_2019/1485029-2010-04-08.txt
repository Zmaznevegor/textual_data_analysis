The Date of This Prospectus is: April 1, 2010 1 Table of Contents Table of Contents Page Summary 4 Our Business 4 Corporate History 5 The Offering 5 Financial Information 5 Risk Factors 6 An investment in the Shares involves a high degree of risk. 6 Risks Related to Our Financial Condition 6 Because we had reoccurring losses, it is uncertain whether we will be able to achieve our business objectives. 6 Because we have limited operating capital, and if we are not successful in continuing to grow our business and obtaining additional capital, then we may have to scale back or even cease our ongoing business operations. 6 Because we have faced the recurrent inability to continue as a going concern, you may lose your entire investment in our company. 7 Risks Related to Our Business 7 Because we are a developing company with limited operating history and only one current source or revenue, our business may fail should an event arise which would compromise this single source of revenue. 7 Because our marketplace is inherently “hit driven,” and our success depends on the appeal of products on infomercials, we may be forced to discontinue operations if our campaigns are unsuccessful. 7 If we are unable to identify and market new products, our ability to increase or maintain our sales and profitability will be negatively affected. 8 In the event that we are unable to successfully compete within the infomercial industry, we may not be able to achieve profitable operations. 8 Because our products may have defects, we could be subject to significant costs or damages which could adversely affect market acceptance or our products. 9 If we fail to implement our product manufacturing and distribution strategy effectively, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer. 9 If we are not granted full protection for property rights over any copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade secrets, we may have difficulty safeguarding our name or the public’s identification of our grand resulting in a potential loss of any competitive advantage. 10 If we are unable to successfully manage growth, our operations could be adversely affected. 10 Because one of our largest shareholders is also our legal counsel, the loss of his services could substantially affect our business operations. 11 If we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, we may not be able to implement our business plan. 11 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 11 Our common stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets, which may limit the liquidity and price of our Common Stock more than if our Common Stock were quoted or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a national exchange. 11 The trading price of our common stock may decrease due to factors beyond our control. 11 If a market for our common stock does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares. 12 2 Table of Contents If the selling shareholders sell a large number of shares all at once or in blocks, the market price of our shares would most likely decline. 12 Because we will be a public reporting company, we face increased costs and risks that could harm our growing business. 13 Because we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. 13 Because we will be subject to the “Penny Sock” rules, the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced. 14 If our shares are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board, we will be required to remain current in our filings with the SEC and our securities will not be eligible for quotation if we are not current in our filings with the SEC. 14 Because of market pressures on our common stock, the market price of our shares may decline. 14 Note Regarding

Summary The Company Our Business We are in the business of locating inventive products and coordinating the process of marketing those products on infomercials and other distribution channels. Within the last five years, we have only exploited one such product, a fishing lure product known as the Banjo Minnow Fishing Lure System (“Banjo Minnow”). We own 75% interest in a joint venture, known as Direct Success LLC #3, which has the exclusive rights to manufacture, use, distribute, sell, advertise, promote and otherwise exploit the Banjo Minnow. We do not manufacture or distribute the products that we locate to market. In the case of Banjo Minnow, our joint venture entity subcontracted all manufacturing and distribution details to a company known as TriStar Products, Inc. The Banjo Minnow was aired on an infomercial and is responsible for all of our revenues in the past five years. We receive royalties from the sales of the Banjo Minnow that TriStar distributes in proportion to our holdings in Direct Success LLC #3. We are currently looking to locate and market innovative health, beauty, fashion, fitness and other products for sale through infomercial marketing and distribution channels. Profits are expected to be derived from inbound sales, outbound sales, up sells and retail distribution. In addition to direct sales from infomercial play, infomercials drive customers to websites and retail centers and assist in branding products and driving product demand. Infomercials currently run in many foreign markets in addition to the US, and we believe that foreign markets represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Our primary objective is to penetrate this rapidly expanding industry by introducing unique and innovative consumer products to national and international markets through a series of infomercial campaigns. We intend to aggressively develop, finance, produce and market various new products for te levision infomercials. We further intend to systematically expand our product list using a direct response model. Our operational strategy consists of employing one of three distinct business alternatives for each product/infomercial: § Complete Project Funding - We would obtain the exclusive licensing rights to products and pay a nominal royalty (2-5%) of gross sales to the product developer; § Joint Venture Projects - We would share costs of production, marketing and distribution and would share revenues with product developers; and § Straight Royalty Arrangements - We would partially finance the infomercials in exchange for a fixed royalty on gross sales. 4 Table of Contents The key to our ability to continually attract new products and new product developers will, in large part, determine our success. As part of our strategy, we intend to develop strategic alliances with strong companies that are established operators in the infomercial and advertising industry. Corporate History We were incorporated on March 1, 2001 under the laws of the state of Nevada under the name Effective Sports Nutrition Corporation. On April 11, 2005, Effective Sports Nutrition changed its name to Midwest E.S.W.T. Corp. On July 18, 2005, the company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Direct Success, Inc., a California corporation. As a result of the agreement, Midwest E.S.W.T issued an aggregate of 114,851,043 shares of common stock to the shareholders of Direct Success, Inc. in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding common stock in Director Success, Inc. On December 14, 2005, Midwest E.S.W.T changed its name to DM Products, Inc. As a result of this transaction, Direct Success, Inc. is the wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant, DM Products, Inc. The Offering Securities Being Offered Up to 148,009,888 shares of our common stock, issued to shareholders of Direct Success, Inc as the result of 1) the Share Exchange Agreement between us and Direct Success, Inc., 2) shares issued as compensation for services provided to the company, and 3) shares issued pursuant to a private placements. Offering Price and Alternative Plan of Distribution All shares being offered are being sold by existing shareholders without our involvement, so the actual price of the stock will be determined by prevailing market prices at the time of sale or by private transactions negotiated by the selling shareholders. The offering price will thus be determined by market factors and the independent decisions of the selling shareholders. Minimum Number of Shares To Be Sold in This Offering None Securities Issued and to be Issued 239,937,352 shares of our common stock are issued and outstanding as of April 1, 2010. All of the common stock to be sold under this prospectus will be sold by existing shareholders. There will be no increase in our issued and outstanding shares as a result of this offering. Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the selling shareholders.

You should carefully consider the risks described below before purchasing any shares. Our most significant risks and uncertainties are described below; if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the trading of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment therein. You should acquire the shares only if you can afford to lose your entire investment. Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission also contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we have described below. Please refer to “Note Regarding Forward-Look ing Statements” on pages 15 of this Prospectus. Risks Related to Our Financial Condition Because we had reoccurring losses, it is uncertain whether we will be able to achieve our business objectives . Although we had net income of $88,670 for the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred net losses of $38,693 and $163,051 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We cannot assure you that we will not sustain similar or higher net losses or that we will ever sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis at any time in the future. Our operations are subject to the risks and competition inherent in the establishment of a business enterprise. There can be no assurance that future operations will be profitable. Revenues and profits, if any, will depend upon various factors, including the current market for our products. We may not achieve o ur business objectives and the failure to achieve such goals would have an adverse impact on us. We expect to incur net losses as we build our business and execute our operational strategy. We are using a substantial portion of our cash resources to develop, market and sell our products. We may not achieve profitability or positive cash flow from our operations before we use up our cash. If we cannot generate positive cash flow from our activities in a timely basis or raise additional capital, your shares may be worthless. Because we have limited operating capital, and if we are not successful in continuing to grow our business and obtaining additional capital, then we may have to scale back or even cease our ongoing business operations. We do not have sufficient capital for current operations through our cash position and current cash flows. We had working capital of $62,576 as of December 31, 2009. We will require additional financing to pay our debts, operate our business and to fund our growth plans. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on attractive terms, if at all. We have no firm commitments for additional cash. If we are not able to raise capital and operate profitably, we may have to scale back or cease operations and investors may lose some or all of their investment in our company. 6 Table of Contents Because we have faced the recurrent inability to continue as a going concern, you may lose your entire investment in our company. Our independent registered public accounting firm’s opinion on our 2007, 2008 and 2009 financial statements, which are included herein, includes an explanatory paragraph indicating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For the past 3 years or more, we have operated with limited operating capital. We will continue to face immediate and substantial cash needs, and there is a risk we may continue to require more investment capital to fund our business plan. You may lose your entire investment in our company. Risks Related to Our Business Because we are a developing company with limited operating history and only one current source of revenue, our business may fail should an event arise which would compromise this single source of revenue. We are a developing company with limited operations since the date of our inception. Our entire revenue, for the past five years, has been derived through our wholly owned subsidiary, and that entity, in turn, has derived its revenue as the result of one infomercial campaign. Although our management is continually searching for additional products and business opportunities, and has completed evaluations of several potential product ideas, currently, total company revenue is derived from royalty payments received as a result of the Banjo Minnow fishing lure infomercial campaign. Should an event arise which would compromise the royalties we receive from the Banjo Minow campaign, it will be unlikely that we will continue to survive as a going concern. Because our marketplace is inherently “hit driven,” and our success depends on the appeal of products on infomercials, we may be forced to discontinue operations if our campaigns are unsuccessful. We depend on infomercials as our sole distribution channels for marketing and selling our products. The success rate of an infomercial is approximately 10% . If customers are not as receptive to new infomercial content or product offerings, our sales through our infomercial sales channel may decline. In addition, if there is a marked increase in the price we pay for our media time, the cost-effectiveness of our infomercials will decrease. If our infomercials are broadcast during times when viewership is low, this could also result in a decrease of the cost-effectiveness of such broadcasts, which could cause our results of operations to suffer. Also, to the extent we have committed in advance for broadcast time for our infomercials, we would have fewer resources available for potentially more effective distribution channels. To develop a profitable business, we must minimize the number of unsuccessful campaigns and use our capital and any profits from successful campaigns to fund operations between successful campaigns. Although we are starting to see some success with the Banjo Minnow campaign, we may not have enough cash from internal sources to continue operations. If that were to happen, we would need to seek additional funding, which would dilute our current shareholders and might not be available on any reasonable terms. If we cannot raise needed additional capital, we would be forced to discontinue operations. 7 Table of Contents If we are unable to identify and market new products, our ability to increase or maintain our sales and profitability will be negatively affected. Our ability to maintain and increase revenues depends, to a large extent, on the periodic introduction and availability of new products. If we fail to identify these new products, or if we fail to enter into relationships with their developers prior to widespread distribution within the market, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Any new products we identify may have a limited sales life. As a result, we will need to continue to identify new successful products to remain in business. If we identify a potentially successful product, we must also develop a successful campaign to attract consumer interest. Furthermore, it is possible that new products will never achieve widespread consumer acceptance, also adversely affecting our sales and profitability. In the event that we are unable to successfully compete within the infomercial industry, we may not be able to achieve profitable operations. The business of selling products in infomercial industry is highly competitive. This market includes numerous manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers both in the United States and abroad. The market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. In addition, our products may be, or are at the risk of becoming, obsolete due to new product introductions or new technologies. Our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products and technologies that are superior to ours, produce similar products at a lower cost than we can or adapt more quickly to consumer preferences. Any of these developments would harm our operating results. We compete in select product categories against a number of multinational manufacturers, many of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do. Therefore, these larger competitors have the ability to spend more aggressively on advertising, marketing and research and to grow more quickly through acquisitions. Our largest competitors currently sell their products more outlets than we do and have significantly more selling capabilities than we do. Our competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below the prices at which our products are typically offered. Competitive pricing may require us to reduce our prices, which would decrease our profitability or result in lost sales. Our competitors, many of whom have greater resources than we do, may be better able to withstand these price reductions and lost sales. We cannot assure you that future price or product changes by our competitors will not adversely affect our net sales or that we will be able to react with price or product changes of our own to maintain our current market position. 8 Table of Contents Because our products may have defects, we could be subject to significant costs or damages which could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. Despite testing and quality assurance efforts that we intend to implement, it is possible that product defects will be found in some of our products. The manufacture and sale of consumer goods involves an inherent risk of liability in the event of product failure or claim of harm caused by product operation. If this should happen, it is likely that our products will be delayed in gaining market acceptance and our sales will be lower than projected. These events may also require us to divert our resource from product development in order to resolve these problems. Additionally, we may suffer a consequent injury to our reputation, increased service and support costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully conduct our planned business. We have in place, through Tristar Products, Inc., product liability insurance for the Banjo Minnow and we plan to obtain product liability insurance coverage for additional products as well; however, there can be no assurance that such coverage will remain available at a reasonable cost and in amounts sufficient to protect us against claims or recalls that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. If we fail to implement our product manufacturing and distribution strategy effectively, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer. We rely on third party distributors and manufactures for our products. For our Banjo Minnow product, we rely on TriStar Products, Inc. to manufacture and distribute the product to customers. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We plan to pursue and enter into written agreements with the third party manufacturers to manufacture our products and ship them directly to our customers. If we lose the services of our third party manufacturers, we may be unable to secure the services of replacement manufacturers. In addition, if we are unable to procure written agreements with all of these manufacturers, they could refuse to supply some or all of our products, reduce the number of products that they supply or change the terms and prices under which they normally supply our products. The occurrence of any such conditions will have a materially negative effect upon our reputation and our ability to distribute our products, which will cause a material reduction in our revenues. We plan to use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products in the future aside from informercials, including direct response television sales, indirect sales through retail stores and sales through a website. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach all of the potential customer segments for our products is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore profitability. 9 Table of Contents If we are not granted full protection for property rights over any copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade secrets, we may have difficulty safeguarding our name or the public’s identification of our brand resulting in a potential loss of any competitive advantage. We do not currently own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark. However, our future success relies, in part, on our ability to protect any copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade secrets we acquire. We intend to rely primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, customer licensing agreements, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect those proprietary rights. We anticipate entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with which we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We can make no guarantee that these contractual arrangements or any other steps we may take to protect our intellectual property will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that we will succeed in deterring independent third party development of similar products or businesses. We plan to register any inventions eligible for patent or trade protection. However, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we seek to do business. Additionally, as part of our distribution network, we may be required to license certain of our intellectual property to distributors. There can be no assurance that such licensees will not take actions that might materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. We will also rely on certain licensed technology from suppliers of key database technology, operating systems and certain hardware components in order to conduct our business. We can make no guarantee that these third party technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. If any one of these licenses terminates and a replacement license is not readily available, we may be forced to obtain substitute technology with a lower quality of performance on less favorable terms. If this should happen our operational efficiency could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert a claim of infringement against us with respect to past, current or future technologies. We expect that participants in the infomercial market will be increasingly subject to infringement claims, as the number of services and competitors in this industry segment grows. Any such claim, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service upgrade delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. We may not be able to negotiate such royalty or licensing agreements on terms acceptable to us. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to successfully manage growth, our operations could be adversely affected. Our progress is expected to require the full utilization of our management, financial and other resources, which to date has occurred with limited working capital. Our ability to manage growth effectively will depend on our ability to improve and expand operations, including our financial and management information systems, and to recruit, train and manage sales personnel. There can be no absolute assurance that management will be able to manage growth effectively. If we do not properly manage the growth of our business, we may experience significant strains on our management and operations and disruptions in our business. Various risks arise when companies and industries grow quickly. If our business or industry grows too quickly, our ability to meet customer demand in a timely and efficient manner could be challenged. We may also experience development delays as we seek to meet increased demand for our products. Our failure to properly manage the growth that we or our industry might experience could negatively impact our ability to execute on our operating plan and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on our business, our cash flow and results of operations, and our reputation with our current or potential customers. 10 Table of Contents Because one of our largest shareholders is also our legal counsel, the loss of his services could substantially affect our business operations Our legal counsel is currently the second largest shareholder in the company. We anticipate continuing such representation unless a conflict of interest arises. If such a conflict arises, our Board will consider the extent to and the manner in which our interests may diverge from those of our legal counsel, officers and directors, and our directors will vote to determine whether to seek new counsel or waive any potential conflict. If we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, we may not be able to implement our business plan. If any member of our senior management should cease working on our behalf, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We do not maintain "key person" life insurance policies. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. If we fail to retain and attract the necessary personnel, our ability to execute our business plan could be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our Common Stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets, which may limit the liquidity and price of our Common Stock more than if our Common Stock were quoted or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a national exchange. Our securities are currently quoted on the Pink Sheets, a FINRA -sponsored and operated inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities not included in the Nasdaq Stock Market. Quotation of our securities on the Pink Sheets may limit the liquidity and price of our securities more than if our securities were quoted or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a national exchange. Some investors may perceive our securities to be less attractive because they are traded in the over-the-counter market. In addition, as a Pink Sheets listed company, we do not attract the extensive analyst coverage that accompanies companies listed on other exchanges. Further, institutional and other investors may have investment guidelines that restrict or prohibit investing in securities traded on the Pink Sheets. These factors may have an adverse impa ct on the trading and price of our Common Stock. The trading price of our common stock may decrease due to factors beyond our control. Our stock is currently quoted on the Pink Sheets. The stock market from time to time has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging growth companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of their common stock in the public market, the price of our common stock could fall. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity, or equity-related securities, in the future at a price we deem appropriate. 11 Table of Contents The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, most of which are beyond our control: § variations in our quarterly operating results; § changes in general economic conditions and in the child health care product industry; § changes in market valuations of similar companies; § announcements by us or our competitors of significant new contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures, or capital commitments; § loss of a major supplier, customer, partner or joint venture participant; and § the addition or loss of key managerial and collaborative personnel. Any such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares, or may be forced to sell them at a loss. If a market for our common stock does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares. A market for our common stock may never develop. We intend to contact an authorized OTC Bulletin Board market-maker for sponsorship of our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. However, our shares may never be traded on the bulletin board, or, if traded, a public market may not materialize. If our common stock is not traded on the bulletin board or if a public market for our common stock does not develop, investors may not be able to re-sell the shares of our common stock that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment. If the selling shareholders sell a large number of shares all at once or in blocks, the market price of our shares would most likely decline. The selling shareholders are offering 148,009,888 shares of our common stock through this prospectus. The outstanding shares of common stock covered by this prospectus represent approximately 61.69% of the common shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. Shares sold at a price below the current market price at which the common stock is trading will cause that market price to decline. Moreover, the offer or sale of a large number of shares at any price may cause the market price to fall. 12 Table of Contents Because we will be a public reporting company, we face increased costs and risks that could harm our growing business. As a result of the registration of our common stock on this Form S-1, we will become a public reporting company. As such, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we have not incurred in the past. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SCC, has required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. These new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly, to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide accurate financial reports. We are beginning to evaluate how to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules of the SEC, which require, among other things, our management to assess annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on that assessment. During the course of this documentation and testing, we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we may be unable to remedy before the deadline of those reports. There can be no assurance that we will maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that those controls will be adequate in all cases to uncover inaccurate or misleading financial information that could be reported by members of management. If our controls fail to identify any misreporting of financial information, or our management or independent registered public accounting firm were to conclude, in their reports, that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our shares could drop significantly. In addition, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange upon which our common stock may be listed, the SEC or other regulatory authori ties, which would require additional financial and management resources. Because we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. 13 Table of Contents Because we will be subject to the “Penny Stock” rules, the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced. Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges or quoted on Nasdaq). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole ma rket maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares. If our shares are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board, we will be required to remain current in our filings with the SEC and our securities will not be eligible for quotation if we are not current in our filings with the SEC. Currently, our shares are quoted on the Pink Sheets. In the event that our shares are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board, we will be required to remain current in our filings with the SEC in order for shares of our common stock to be eligible for quotation on the over-the-counter bulletin board. In the event that we become delinquent in our required filings with the SEC, quotation of our common stock will be terminated following a 30 day grace period if we do not make our required filing during that time. If our shares are not eligible for quotation on the over-the-counter bulletin board, investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares. Because of market pressures on our common stock, the market price of our shares may decline. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of: § quarterly variations in our operating results; § interest rate changes; § changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results; § our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period; § changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or in general; § operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us; § news reports relating to trends in our markets; § changes in laws and regulations affecting our business; § material announcements by us or our competitors; § sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur; and § general economic and political conditions, such as recessions and acts of war or terrorism. 14 Table of Contents Fluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of an investor’s investment in the company. We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of common stock appreciates. If a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital. Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” or “project” or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These statements are expressed in good faith and based upon a reasonable basis when made, but there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved or accomplished. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding, among other things: § the demand for our products; § our ability to expand our product offerings; § the competitive environment in our business; § our operations and ability to achieve cost savings; § the effect of technological and regulatory changes on our business; § our cash needs; and § our financial performance. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from the future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. These statements may be found under “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” and “DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROPERTY,” as well as in this Prospectus generally. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the risks outlined under “RISK FACTORS” and matters described in this Prospectus generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can b e no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. In addition to the information expressly required to be included in this filing, we will provide such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Although forward-looking statements in this report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report, other than as may be required by applicable law or regulation. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected or projected. We will have little likelihood of long-term success unless we are able to continue to raise capital from the sale of our securities until, if ever, we generate positive cash flow from operations. 15 Table of Contents Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered through this prospectus by the selling shareholders. Determination of Offering Price All shares being offered will be sold by existing shareholders without our involvement, consequently the actual price of the stock will be determined by prevailing market prices at the time of sale or by private transactions negotiated by the selling shareholders. The offering price will thus be determined by market factors and the independent decisions of the selling shareholders. Please refer to “Plan of Distribution.” Dilution The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued and outstanding. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. Selling Shareholders The selling shareholders named in this prospectus are offering all of the 148,009,888 shares of common stock offered through this prospectus. At the time of the purchase, the selling shareholders had no agreements or understandings to distribute the securities. The shares include the following: § 104,903,888 shares of common stock, which were received in the Share Exchange Agreement, dated July 18, 2005, between us and Direct Success, Inc. ; § 43,076,000 shares of common stock, which were paid as consideration for services performed for the company; and § 30,000 shares of common stock, which were issued to Joel Boodoosingh in a private placement for cash consideration of $30,000.00. The following table provides information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock held by each of the selling shareholders as of April 1, 2010, including: 1. the number of shares owned by each prior to this offering; 2. the total number of shares that are to be offered by each; 3. the total number of shares that will be owned by each upon completion of the offering; 4. the percentage owned by each upon completion of the offering; and 5. the identity of the beneficial holder of any entity that owns the shares. 16 Table of Contents The named party beneficially owns and has sole voting and investment power over all shares or rights to the shares, unless otherwise shown in the table. The numbers in this table assume that none of the selling shareholders sells shares of common stock not being offered in this prospectus or purchases additional shares of common stock, and assumes that all shares offered are sold. The percentages are based on 239,937,352 shares of common stock outstanding on April 1, 2010.

These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A Selling Stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: § ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; § block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; § purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; § an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; § privately negotiated transactions; § settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part; § broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; § through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; § a combination of any such methods of sale; or § any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as amended, if available, rather than under this Prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA NASD Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with NASD IM-2440. In connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares of the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this Prospectus, which shares such broker-de aler or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this Prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). 37 Table of Contents The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Each Selling Stockholder has informed us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the Common Stock. We are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the shares. Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the Prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 as promulgated thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this Prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this Prospectus. There is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the Selling Stockholders. We agreed to keep this Prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) two years from the date that the registration statement of which this Prospectus is part is declared effective (ii) the date on which the shares may be resold by the Selling Stockholders without registration and without regard to any volume limitations by reason of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (iii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to this Prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an e xemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of the common stock by the Selling Stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this Prospectus available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this Prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance w ith Rule 172 under the Securities Act). We cannot estimate the number of shares, if any, which will be sold by the Selling Stockholders pursuant to this Prospectus. 38 Table of Contents Description of Securities to be Registered/Dividends/Pre-emptive Rights We are authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock with a par value of $0.001 per share.

Description of Business Organizational Structure We were incorporated on March 1, 2001 under the laws of the state of Nevada under the name Effective Sports Nutrition Corporation. On April 11, 2005, Effective Sports Nutrition changed its name to Midwest E.S.W.T. Corp. On July 18, 2005, we then entered into a share exchange agreement with Direct Success, Inc., a California corporation. As a result of the agreement, Midwest E.S.W.T agreed that a total of 114,851,043 shares of Restricted Common Stock were to be issued to the shareholders of Direct Success, Inc. Direct Success, Inc., in turn, surrendered all of its authorized stock to Midwest E.S.W.T. On December 14, 2005, Midwest E.S.W.T changed its name to DM Products, Inc. Operations We are in the business of locating inventive products and coordinating the process of marketing those products on infomercials and other distribution channels. Within the last five years, we have only exploited one such product, a fishing lure product known as the “Banjo Minnow.” Although we tested several products in 2003 and 2004, those test runs on infomercials did not justify going forward with a full infomercial campaign. We have only pursued the Banjo Minnow in a full infomercial campaign. We own 75% interest in a joint venture, known as Direct Success LLC #3, which has the exclusive rights to manufacture, use, distribute, sell, advertise, promote and otherwise exploit the Banjo Minnow. We do not manufacture or distribute the products that we locate to market. In the case of Banjo Minnow, our joint venture entity subcontracted all manufacturing and distribution details to a company known as TriStar Products, Inc. The Banjo Minnow was aired on an infomercial and is responsible for all of our revenues to date. We receive royalties from the sales of the Banjo Minnow that TriStar distributes in proportion to our holdings in Direct Success LLC #3. On or about August 16, 2002, Direct Success, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a joint venture with Buena Vista Infomercial Corporation and formed Direct Success, LLC #3 for the purpose of acquiring the exclusive manufacturing and distribution rights to the Banjo Minnow. Direct Success LLC #3 is a limited liability company, organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and is 75% owned by Direct Success, Inc. The remaining 25% is owned by Buena Vista Infomercial Corporation. 40 Table of Contents On or about October 10, 2003, Direct Success, LLC #3 entered into an agreement with Banjo Buddies, Inc. (the owner and inventor of the lure) in which Banjo granted to Direct Success LLC, #3 the exclusive rights to manufacture, use, distribute, sell, advertise, promote and otherwise exploit the Banjo Minnow. Direct Success LLC, #3 receives a royalty based on the sales of the product. On or about May 11, 2005, Direct Success, LLC #3 subcontracted the manufacturing and distribution rights to TriStar Products, Inc. Pursuant to this subcontract, Direct Success, LLC #3 receives a royalty, based on sales generated by TriStar. We are currently looking to locate and market innovative health, beauty, fashion, fitness and other products for sale through infomercial marketing and distribution channels. Profits are expected to be derived from inbound sales, outbound sales, up sells and retail distribution. In addition to direct sales from infomercial play, infomercials drive customers to websites and retail centers and assist in branding products and driving product demand. Infomercials currently run in many foreign markets in addition to the US, and we believe that foreign markets represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Our primary objective is to penetrate this rapidly expanding industry by introducing unique and innovative consumer products to national and international markets through a series of infomercial campaigns. We intend to aggressively dev elop, finance, produce and market various new products for television infomercials. At the same time, we intend to systematically expand our product list using a direct response model. Our operational strategy consists of employing one of three distinct business alternatives for each product/infomercial: § Complete Project Funding - The Company would obtain the exclusive licensing rights to products and pay a nominal royalty (2-5%) of gross sales to the product developer; § Joint Venture Projects - The Company would share costs of production, marketing and distribution and would share revenues with product developers; and § Straight Royalty Arrangements - The Company would partially finance the infomercials in exchange for a fixed royalty on gross sales. Of course, the key to our ability to continually attract new products and new product developers will, in large part, determine its success. As part of our strategy, we intend to develop strategic alliances with strong companies that are established operators in the infomercial and advertising industry. Infomercials are watched by a diverse range of consumers, consisting of both men and women, according to Direct Marketing Today. Many successful infomercials have targeted the tastes of this audience by offering health, beauty, fashion and fitness products. Unfortunately, many product inventors are unable to bring innovative and promising products to market because they do not have the know-how or the financial capability to efficiently and effectively manufacture and market their products for sale to a large number of consumers. We intend to bridge this gap for inventors by funding and managing the various tasks associated with launching and maintaining a successful infomercial sales campaign. Our business strategy focuses on funding and supervising the product's development and manufacture, the production of the infomercial and the over all marketing and sales campaign of the product. We think that the arrangements we enter into with product developers will be one of the following: 1) Complete Project Funding, 2) Joint Venture Projects, or 3) Straight Royalty Contracts, as discussed above. Our directors and officers are consistently approached with ideas for new products from various individuals and companies. It is expected that the officers and directors will continue to be “pitched” for new product ideas and that our referral sources will grow as we gain recognition in the infomercial industry. As opportunities arise, our officers and directors will present potential product ideas to our Board of Directors for its discussion and review. In deciding which products to pursue, the Board will consider, among other things, the product's viability, costs of development and marketing, acceptable sales price point per unit, as well as the product's overall likelihood of success. In some instances, the Board may retain an outside consultant to evaluate such things as the product's likely market appeal or the prod uct's optimal price point. We will pursue products approved by a majority vote of the Board. Although we expect that the directors and officers will continue to be approached by inventors with viable products without any solicitation, the Board of Directors may decide to solicit product pitches or ideas in the future if the Board believes that such a strategy would be in the Company’s best interest. 41 Table of Contents If the Board approves a product for further development, we intend to retain outside parties to produce the infomercial, assist in the design, the overall marketing campaign and sales process, and source and manufacture the product for competitive rates. When determining what parties to retain for these services, our Board of Directors will consider several factors, including a proven track record, cost and the ability to meet our timetable. We do not intend to retain any one service provider exclusively, and, instead intend to seek competitive bids from numerous potential providers for each infomercial campaign. Principal Place of Business Our principal place of business is P.O. Box 2458, Walnut Creek, CA 94595. Competition We believe we are distinct from the other service providers operating within direct response television market because we intend to specialize in offering a complete suite of distribution in the mass market. We are not aware of any operators who focus on financing, supervising and managing an infomercial campaign through a model that is based on outsourcing most development, marketing and sales services. However, there are many entities that operate in the direct response television arena, several of whom offer one or more of the services that it intends to manage and supervise for the accounts. Nautilus Inc. (formerly Direct Focus), is a strong operator in the infomercial industry. Nautilus, Inc. takes a product from conception to market by performing all tasks and services “in house.” However, while Nautilus, Inc. participates in the infomercial market, the infomercial advertising arena is only one of its several operating areas. Nautilus, Inc. has a broader core business, comprised of functions associated with traditional advertising firms. For instance, Nautilus Group develops and manages direct response television spots, 30 and 60-second ads as well as print, online and other forms of advertising. The products Nautilus, Inc. markets via infomercial will compete directly with the products the we ultimately bring to market, however, we believe that our approach to infomer cial campaigns will allow us to successfully compete with Nautilus, Inc. in that market. 42 Table of Contents Employees We currently employ two (2) employees. Patents and Trademarks We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark. Description of Properties From early 2003 until April of 2008 our executive and administrative offices were located at 575 Anton Boulevard in Costa Mesa, California 92626. Since then, we have relocated all executive and administrative offices to a new location in northern California. Our present mailing address and contact information is; DM Products, Inc. P.O Box 2458, Walnut Creek California 94595. Phone: 925-943-2090 Fax: 925-943-2091 www.dmproducts.biz . We currently do not own any real-estate or have any long or short term real-estate lease obligations. We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our present needs, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate expansion of our operations. It is possible, however , that we will acquire additional needed facilities by the end of 2010. Our growth strategy includes acquisition of additional businesses and products to complement and strengthen our current offering of products and services. If our current or planned efforts in this regard are successful, we may lease or purchase property in connection with such an acquisition. Legal Proceedings Since our inception, we have been involved in one (1) matter of litigation with Banjo Minnow. This matter was submitted to Arbitration and ultimately settled. However, we realize the nature of our industry is often the subject of litigation and various claims. Most arise as the result of product defects, advertizing issues, and conract disputes between inventors, distributors and outsources contractors. As of the date of this filing, there are no matters of pending or threatened litigation. There are no other matters of pending or threatened litigation. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Our common stock is currently quoted on PinkSheets, which is sponsored by FINRA. The PinkSheets is a network of security dealers who buy and sell stock. The dealers are connected by a computer network that provides information on current "bids" and "asks", as well as volume information. Our shares are quoted under the symbol “DMPD.” The following table summarizes the low and high prices of our common stock for each of the calendar quarters of 2008 and 2009. 2008 2009 High Low High Low First Quarter .005 .0021 .001 .0002 Second Quarter .0025 .001 .001 .0001 Third Quarter .002 .0005 .0072 .0005 Fourth Quarter .0011 .0002 .004 .0007 43 Table of Contents There were 294 shareholders of record as of April 1, 2010. This number does not include an indeterminate number of shareholders whose shares are held by brokers in “street name.” Our common stock is subject to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") regulating broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks." Those disclosure rules applicable to "penny stocks" require a broker dealer, prior to a transaction in a "penny stock" not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized disclosure document prepared by the Commission. That disclosure document advises an investor that investment in "penny stocks" can be very risky and that the investor's salesperson or broker is not an impartial advisor, but rather paid to sell the shares. The disclosure contains further warnings for the investor to exercise caution in connection with an investment in "penny stocks," to independently investigate the security, as well as the salesperson the investor is working with and to understand the risky nature of an investment in this security. The broker dealer must also provide the customer with certain other information and must make a special written determination that the "penny stock" is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. Further, the rules require that, following the proposed transaction, the broker provide the customer with monthly account statements containing market information about the prices of the securities. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. Many brokers may be unwilling to engage in transactions involving our common stock because of the added disclosure requirements, thereby making it more difficult for stockholders to dispose of their shares. We have agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC registering the resale of the selling shareholders’ shares of common stock. We will use our best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the resale registration statement from the effective date through and until all securities registered under the registration statement have been sold or are otherwise able to be sold pursuant to Rule 144.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of DM Products, Inc. as of December 31, 2009, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclo sures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DM Products, Inc. as of December 31, 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company is dependent on raising capital to fund operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

F-5 Table of Contents DM Products , Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations DM Products, Inc.(the Company) was incorporated on March 1, 2001 as Effective Sport Nutrition Corporation. Subsequently, on April 11, 2005, the Company changed its name to Midwest E.S.W.T Corp and on December 14, 2005, it changed its name again to DM Products, Inc. On July 18, 2005, the Company acquired Direct Success, Inc. a California Corporation in exchange for 70 % of the Company's Common Stock, making Direct Success, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Midwest E.S.W.T agreed that a total of 114,851,043 shares of Restricted Common Stock were to be issued to shareholders of Direct Success, Inc. DM Products, Inc operates from Walnut Creek, California and it wholly owns Direct Sucess, Inc which owns 75% of Direct Success, LLC 3 a limited liability company formed on or about August 16, 2002. Direct Success, Inc entered into a joint venture with Buena Vista Infomercial Corporation which owns 25%. The purpose is to market products through direct response to television infomercials. The companies obtain the distribution, production, and licensing rights to a product in exchange for royalty agreements based on the sales of the products. The Company sets up the production, marketing and the distribution of the products. Cash and Cash Equivalents Policy The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Licensing Agreements Direct Success entered into a manufacturing, marketing and distribution agreement with Banjo Buddies who is the inventor of Banjo Minnow, a fishing lure which Direct Success 3 had a licence agreement to market the product since Oct 2002. The Company entered into a modification of said agreement in April 2005. On or about May 11, 2005 Direct Success LLC 3, subcontracted the manufacturing and distribution rights to TriStar Products, Inc. In March 2007, Direct Success granted back to Banjo, the right,license and privilege for internet sales and small parts sale of the product. Under the agreement, Banjo will pay Direct Success 4% royalty on all gross sales of product. As of date of settlement Direct Success no longer receive the 4% royalty for internet and part sales from Banjo Buddies. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DM Products, Inc., Direct Success, Inc. and the accounts of its 75% owned subsidiaries Direct Success LLC 3. (collectively referred to as Direct Success, Inc.) The Company consolidated all entities in which it has a controlling interest. All material inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Property and equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Major expenditures and those which substantially increase useful lives are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to operations when incurred. When property and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Once placed in service, depreciable assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using both accelerated and straight-line methods. Use of Estimates Timely preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, some of which may require revision in future period. Advertising Policy The Company recognizes advertising expense as incurred. The Company recognized no advertising expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 F-6 Table of Contents Impairment Policy In the event that it tangible operational assets and finite life intangible assets are impaired, DM Products, Inc. will follow FASB topic 360 to measure any impairment loss. There has not been any impairment loss for 2009. Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets are evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be written down to fair value. Deposits Deposits consist of $0 for the year ended December 31,2009 respectively . All deposits are carried at the lower of fair value or cost. Insurance Liability The Company maintains various insurance policies for workers’ compensation, employee health, and officer and director. Pursuant to these policies, the Company is responsible for losses up to certain limits and is required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. No liability exists as of December 31, 2009, but in the event a liability is incurred, the amount will be based on management’s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date. Any future estimated liability may not be discounted and may be based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions, and economic conditions. If actual trends differ from t he estimates, future financial results could be impacted. Stock-based Compensation The company policy requires all share-based payments to employees, including other equity-based compensation arrangements, to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the awards or par value. During the year ended December 31, 2009, stock-based compensation expense totaled $10,040. See note 10 Related Parties for further discussion. Concentration of Risk The company is earning (over 90%) majority of the royalty income from Tristar Products, Inc. Since the company is depending on Tristar Products, Inc, inabilities of these companies to perform may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization include organization costs and informercial production costs. Organization costs and informercial production costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years and three years, respectively. Earnings (Loss) Per Share We use FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share” (ASC 260) for calculating the basic and diluted earnings per share. We compute basic earnings per share by dividing the income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect, if any, from the potential exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method, as well as the dilutive effect from outstanding restricted Common Stock. Potential common shares not included in the calculation of net income per share, since their effect would be anti-dilutive.Per share basic and diluted net income( loss) amounted to $0.0004 for the year ended December 31, 2009. Prepaid Expenses Prepaid expenses include prepaid audit fees and prepaid insurance. Prepaid expenses as of December 31, 2009 is $21,454. F-7 Table of Contents Fair Market Value Policy In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC Topic -820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (ASC 820) as amended by ASC Topic 820-10-55. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and enhances fair value measurement disclosure. ASC Topic 820-10-55 delays, until the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, the effective date for ASC 820 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or operations. New Accounting Policies in 2009 On July 1, 2009, the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) became FASB’s officially recognized source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applicable to all public and non-public non-governmental entities, superseding existing FASB, AICPA, EITF and related literature. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other accounting literature is considered non-authoritative. The switch to the ASC affects the way companies refer to U.S. GAAP in financial statements and accounting policies. Citing particular content in the ASC involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the Topic, Subtopic, Section and Paragraph structure. FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share.” New authoritative accounting guidance under FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share,” provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The new authoritative accounting guidance will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities,” (i) changes existing guidance for determining whether an impairment is other than temporary to debt securities and (ii) replaces the existing requirement that the entity’s management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery with a requirement that management assert: (a) it does not have the intent to sell the security; and (b) it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. Under ASC Topic 320, declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. The new authoritative accounting guidance will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations.”New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. ASC Topic 805 requires an acquirer, upon initially obtaining control of another entity, to recognize the assets, liabilities and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of that consideration may be determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. This fair value approach replaces the cost-allocation process required under previous accounting guidance whereby the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value. ASC Topic 805 requires acquirers to expense acquisition-related costs as incurred rather than allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as was previously the case under prior accounting guidance. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated. If fair value of such an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated, the asset or liability would generally be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC Topic 805, the requirements of ASC Topic 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations,” would have to be met in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting. Pre-acquisition contingencies are to be recognized at fair value, unless it is a non-contractual contingency that is not likely to materialize, in which case, nothing should be recognized in purchase accounting and, instead, that contingency would be subject to the probable and estimable recognition criteria of ASC Topic 450, “Contingen cies.” The new authoritative accounting guidance will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. F-8 Table of Contents FASB ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” amended prior guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Under ASC Topic 810, a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements, ASC Topic 810 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the non-controlling interest. It also requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest. Further new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 810 amends prior guidance to change how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. The new authoritative accounting guidance requires additional disclosures about the reporting entity’s involvement with variable-interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement as well as its affect on the entity’s financial statements.The new authoritative a ccounting guidance under ASC Topic 810 will be effective for the Company on November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” amends prior guidance to amend and expand the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities to provide greater transparency about (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under ASC Topic 815, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To meet those objectives, the new authoritative accounting guidance requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 815 will be effective for the Company on November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 820,”Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” affirms that the objective of fair value when the market for an asset is not active is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction, and clarifies and includes additional factors for determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset when the market for that asset is not active. ASC Topic 820 requires an entity to base its conclusion about whether a transaction was not orderly on the weight of the evidence. The new accounting guidance amended prior guidance to expand certain disclosure requirements. The Company adopted the new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 820. 0; Adoption of the new guidance did not significantly impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements Further new authoritative accounting guidance (Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-5) under ASC Topic 820 provides guidance for measuring the fair value of a liability in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available. In such instances, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value utilizing a valuation technique that uses (i) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset, (ii) quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets, or (iii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the existing principles of ASC Topic 820, such as an income approach or market approach. The new authoritative accounting guidance also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to i nclude a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. The forgoing new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 820 will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 825 “Financial Instruments.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 825,”Financial Instruments,” requires an entity to provide disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial information and amends prior guidance to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. The new authoritative accounting guidance will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. F-9 Table of Contents FASB ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events,” establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued. ASC Topic 855 defines (i) the period after the balance sheet date during which a reporting entity’s management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, (ii) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and (iii) the disclosures an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 855 became effective for the Company’s financial statements for periods ending after June 15, 2009 and did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have an effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Revenue and Cost Recognition We record revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605 - Revenue Recognition. During the year ended December 31, 2009 our revenues came from royalties. The royalties came from the contract Banjo Minnow the fishing lure with TriStar Products, Inc. Revenues derived from our license sales are recognized when (1) there is evidence of an arrangement, (2) collection of our fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable. Note 2: Going Concern Before being acquired by DM Products, Inc., Direct Success, Inc. had an accumulated loss of $6,195,881. Notwithstanding the continued losses, these financial statements have been prepared by management on a going concern basis. The going concern basis of presentation assumes the Company will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Certain conditions, discussed below, currently exist which raise substantial doubt upon the validity of this assumption. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments thus might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company were unable to continue as a going concern, assets and liabilities would require restatement on a liquidation basis, which would differ materially from the going concern basis. The Company’s future operations are dependant upon the marketing of its products and the Company’s ability to secure sufficient financing to continue operations and marketing of its products. There can be no assurance that the Company’s products will be able to secure market acceptance or that successful commercialization of its products will be achieved. Note 3: Fixed Assets Fixed Assets consists of the following: As of 12/31/2009 Office Equipment 3,193 Mold 3,000 Website 1,300 7,493 Accumulated Depreciation (6,189) Fixed Assets, net 1,304 Total depreciation expenses related to the above mentioned fixed assets were $1,709 for the year ended December 31, 2009. F-10 Table of Contents Note 4: Income Taxes The company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB Topic 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the "liability method" of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Current income taxes are based on the year's income taxable for Federal and state income tax reporting purposes. The Provision income taxes consists of the following: Fo the Year Ended 12/31/2009 Federal - State (minimum taxes and LLC fees) 2,400 2,400 For the Period Ended 12/31/2009 US Tax rate (34%) 0.34 State Rate 0.09 Total Rate 0.43 Valuation Adjustment (0.43) Net Effect - In 2009 DM Products has a Net Operating Loss (NOL) carry forward in the amount $827,375 The tax benefit was not reflected due to a 100% valuation allowance provided as a result of losses and an uncertainty of future profitability. Note 5: Interest Expenses Interest expense for the year December 31, 2009 totaled $459. Note 6: Royalties waived Script To Screen, Inc. has entered into an agreement with Direct Success LLC 3 and Direct Success, Inc. to waive royalties for all past years to date and current year to date as well as future royalties that may come due under the current Royalty Agreement. Total past and current year royalties waived and included in other income equals $47,277.

In 2007 Joel Boodoosingh paid $30,000 for preferred stock in error. DM Products, Inc does not have preferred stock so 30,000 shares common stock will be issued at .001 par value. Banjo Buddies, Inc. Arbitration Direct Success, LLC #3 entered into a Manufacturing, Marketing, and Distribution Agreement with Banjo Buddies, Inc. on October 10, 2003 which was later modified in writing on April 30, 2005. This agreement, and subsequent modification, granted DS the exclusive rights to market and distribute the Banjo Lure a fishing lure, owned by Banjo Buddies, Inc., in exchange for a royalty on sales. Direct Success, LLC #3 subcontracted the rights to manufacture, market and distribute the lure with Tristar Products, Inc. on May 11, 2005. A dispute arose between Direct Success, LLC #3 and Banjo Buddies, Inc. in which both claimed contract breaches to the terms contained in the Manufacturing, Marketing and Distribution Agreement and the modification thereof. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, any disputes arising from the performance of e ither party was required to be submitted to binding arbitration, in the State of California, and governed by California law. Direct Success, LLC #3 commenced arbitration of the dispute by filing a claim with the American Arbitration Association on March 13, 2009 and an Answering Statement and Counterclaim was filed by Banjo Buddies, Inc. on April 20, 2009. On February 26, 2010, prior to commencement of the Arbitration hearing, the parties entered into Settlement Agreement and Release which resolved all issues pertaining to the arbitration and the disputes between the parties. The Arbitration has been dismissed in its entirety. No current litigation exists, and no future disputes are anticipated. F-12 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of DM Products, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of DM Products, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we e xpress no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DM Products, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company is dependent on raising capital to fund operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

F-17 Table of Contents DM Products, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations DM Products, Inc.(the Company) was incorporated on March 1, 2001 as Effective Sport Nutrition Corporation. Subsequently, on April 11, 2005, the Company changed its name to Midwest E.S.W.T Corp and on December 14, 2005, it changed its name again to DM Products, Inc. On July 18, 2005, the Company acquired Direct Success, Inc. a California Corporation in exchange for 70 % of the Company's Common Stock, making Direct Success, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Midwest E.S.W.T agreed that a total of 114,851,043 shares of Restricted Common Stock were to be issued to shareholders of Direct Success, Inc. DM Products, Inc operates from Walnut Creek, California and it wholly owns Direct Sucess, Inc which owns 75% of Direct Success, LLC 3 a limited liability company formed on or about August 16, 2002. Direct Success, Inc entered into a joint venture with Buena Vista Infomercial Corporation which owns 25%. The purpose is to market products through direct response to television infomercials. The companies obtain the distribution, production, and licensing rights to a product in exchange for royalty agreements based on the sales of the products. The Company sets up the production, marketing and the distribution of the products. Cash and Cash Equivalents Policy The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Licensing Agreements Direct Success entered into a manufacturing, marketing and distribution agreement with Banjo Buddies who is the inventor of Banjo Minnow, a fishing lure which Direct Success 3 had a licence agreement to market the product since Oct 2002. The Company entered into a modification of said agreement in April 2005. On or about May 11, 2005 Direct Success LLC 3, subcontracted the manufacturing and distribution rights to TriStar Products, Inc. In March 2007, Direct Success granted back to Banjo, the right,license and privilege for internet sales and small parts sale of the product. Under the agreement, Banjo will pay Direct Success 4% royalty on all gross sales of product. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DM Products, Inc., Direct Success, Inc. and the accounts of its 75% owned subsidiaries Direct Success LLC 3. (collectively referred to as Direct Success, Inc.) The Company consolidated all entities in which it has a controlling interest. All material inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Property and equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Major expenditures and those which substantially increase useful lives are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to operations when incurred. When property and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Once placed in service, depreciable assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using both accelerated and straight-line methods. Use of Estimates Timely preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, some of which may require revision in future period. Advertising Policy The Company recognizes advertising expense as incurred. The Company recognized no advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and the period ended September 30, 2009. F-18 Table of Contents Impairment Policy In the event that that it tangible operational assets and finite life intangible assets are impaired, DM Products, Inc. will follow FASB topic 360 to measure any impairment loss. There has not been any impairment loss for 2007, 2008 and nine months ended 2009. Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets are evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be written down to fair value. Deposits Deposits consist of $992, $0, and $0 in rent deposits as of December 31, 2007, 2008, and September 30,2009 respectively . All deposits are carried at the lower of fair value or cost. Insurance Liability The Company maintains various insurance policies for workers’ compensation, employee health, and officer and director. Pursuant to these policies, the Company is responsible for losses up to certain limits and is required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. No liability exists as of December 31, 2007, 2008, and September 30, 2009, but in the event a liability is incurred, the amount will be based on management’s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date. Any future estimated liability may not be discounted and may be based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions, and economic conditions. If actual trends differ from the estimates, future financial results could be impacted. Stock-based Compensation The company policy requires all share-based payments to employees, including other equity-based compensation arrangements, to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the awards or par value. During fiscal years 2007, 2008, and the period ended September 30, 2009, stock-based compensation expense totaled $20,000, $39,300, and $7,040 respectively. See note 12 Related Parties for further discussion. Concentration of Risk The company is earning (over 90%) majority of the royalty income from Tristar Products, Inc. Also the company is earning royalty from Banjo Buddies Inc., of 4% of gross sales. Since the company is depending on Tristar Products, Inc and Banjo Buddies, Inc, inabilities of these companies to perform may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization include organization costs and informercial production costs. Organization costs and informercial production costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years and three years, respectively. Earnings (Loss) Per Share We use FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share” (ASC 260) for calculating the basic and diluted earnings per share. We compute basic earnings per share by dividing the income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect, if any, from the potential exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method, as well as the dilutive effect from outstanding restricted Common Stock. Potential common shares not included in the calculation of net income per share, since their effect would be anti-dilutive.Per share basic and diluted net income( loss) amounted to ($0.0010),($0.0002) and $0.0004 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, and period ended September 30, 2009 respectively. Prepaid Expenses Prepaid expenses include prepaid audit fees and prepaid insurance. Prepaid expenses for the fiscal years 2007 and 2008, and for the period ended September 30, 2009 are $14,772, $42, and $21,452, respectively. F-19 Table of Contents Fair Market Value Policy In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC Topic -820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (ASC 820) as amended by ASC Topic 820-10-55. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and enhances fair value measurement disclosure. ASC Topic 820-10-55 delays, until the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, the effective date for ASC 820 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or operations. New Accounting Policies in 2009 On July 1, 2009, the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) became FASB’s officially recognized source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applicable to all public and non-public non-governmental entities, superseding existing FASB, AICPA, EITF and related literature. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other accounting literature is considered non-authoritative. The switch to the ASC affects the way companies refer to U.S. GAAP in financial statements and accounting policies. Citing particular content in the ASC involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the Topic, Subtopic, Section and Paragraph structure. FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share.” New authoritative accounting guidance under FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share,” provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The new authoritative accounting guidance will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities,” (i) changes existing guidance for determining whether an impairment is other than temporary to debt securities and (ii) replaces the existing requirement that the entity’s management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery with a requirement that management assert: (a) it does not have the intent to sell the security; and (b) it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. Under ASC Topic 320, declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. The new authoritative accounting guidance will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations.”New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. ASC Topic 805 requires an acquirer, upon initially obtaining control of another entity, to recognize the assets, liabilities and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of that consideration may be determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. This fair value approach replaces the cost-allocation process required under previous accounting guidance whereby the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value. ASC Topic 805 requires acquirers to expense acquisition-related costs as incurred rather than allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as was previously the case under prior accounting guidance. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated. If fair value of such an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated, the asset or liability would generally be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC Topic 805, the requirements of ASC Topic 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations,” would have to be met in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting. Pre-acquisition contingencies are to be recognized at fair value, unless it is a non-contractual contingency that is not likely to materialize, in which case, nothing should be recognized in purchase accounting and, instead, that contingency would be subject to the probable and estimable recognition criteria of ASC Topic 450, “Contingen cies.” The new authoritative accounting guidance will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. F-20 Table of Contents FASB ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” amended prior guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Under ASC Topic 810, a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements, ASC Topic 810 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the non-controlling interest. It also requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest. Further new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 810 amends prior guidance to change how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. The new authoritative accounting guidance requires additional disclosures about the reporting entity’s involvement with variable-interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement as well as its affect on the entity’s financial statements.The new authoritative a ccounting guidance under ASC Topic 810 will be effective for the Company on November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” amends prior guidance to amend and expand the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities to provide greater transparency about (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under ASC Topic 815, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To meet those objectives, the new authoritative accounting guidance requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 815 will be effective for the Company on November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 820,”Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” affirms that the objective of fair value when the market for an asset is not active is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction, and clarifies and includes additional factors for determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset when the market for that asset is not active. ASC Topic 820 requires an entity to base its conclusion about whether a transaction was not orderly on the weight of the evidence. The new accounting guidance amended prior guidance to expand certain disclosure requirements. The Company adopted the new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 820. 0; Adoption of the new guidance did not significantly impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements Further new authoritative accounting guidance (Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-5) under ASC Topic 820 provides guidance for measuring the fair value of a liability in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available. In such instances, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value utilizing a valuation technique that uses (i) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset, (ii) quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets, or (iii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the existing principles of ASC Topic 820, such as an income approach or market approach. The new authoritative accounting guidance also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to i nclude a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. The forgoing new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 820 will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 825 “Financial Instruments.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 825,”Financial Instruments,” requires an entity to provide disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial information and amends prior guidance to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. The new authoritative accounting guidance will be effective for the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. F-21 Table of Contents FASB ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events.” New authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events,” establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued. ASC Topic 855 defines (i) the period after the balance sheet date during which a reporting entity’s management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, (ii) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and (iii) the disclosures an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The new authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 855 became effective for the Company’s financial statements for periods ending after June 15, 2009 and did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have an effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Revenue and Cost Recognition We record revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605 - Revenue Recognition. In 2007 our revenues came from two sources the first is derived from sales of a fishing lure parts for fishing industry. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured and right of returns. The second source revenue in 2007 and became the only source of revenues in 2008 and period ended September 2009 were royalties. The royalties came from two contracts one for parts sales with Banjo Buddies, Inc and the other for Banjo Minnow the fishing lure with TriStar Products, Inc. Revenues derived from our license sales are recognized when (1) there is evidence of an arrangement, (2) collection of our fee is con sidered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable. In 2007, Cost of Sales consists of parts of the Banjo Minnow product and are recorded as incurred based on sales process. Note 2: Going Concern Before being acquired by DM Products, Inc., Direct Success, Inc. had an accumulated loss of $6,195,881. Notwithstanding the continued losses, these financial statements have been prepared by management on a going concern basis. The going concern basis of presentation assumes the Company will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Certain conditions, discussed below, currently exist which raise substantial doubt upon the validity of this assumption. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments thus might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company were unable to continue as a going concern, assets and liabilities would require restatement on a liquidation basis, which would differ materially from the going concern basis. The Company’s future operations are dependant upon the marketing of its products and the Company’s ability to secure sufficient financing to continue operations and marketing of its products. There can be no assurance that the Company’s products will be able to secure market acceptance or that successful commercialization of its products will be achieved.

Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Current income taxes are based on the year's income taxable for Federal and state income tax reporting purposes.

F-25 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following information should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the nine month period ended September 30, 2009, and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 included elsewhere in this Prospectus. We also urge you to review and consider our disclosures describing various risks that may affect our business, which are set forth under the heading “RISK FACTORS.” Executive Overview We, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Direct Success, Inc., develop, finance, produce, market, and distribute unique and innovative health, beauty, fashion, fitness and other products for sale through infomercial marketing and distribution channels. Profits are derived from inbound sales, outbound sales, up sells and retail distribution. Our primary objective is to penetrate this rapidly expanding industry by introducing unique and innovative consumer products to national and international markets through a series of infomercial campaigns. We intend to aggressively develop, finance, produce and market various new products for television infomercials. We intend to systematically expand our product list using a direct response model. Our operational strategy consists of employing one of three distinct business alternatives for each product/infomercial: § Complete Project Funding - The Company would obtain the exclusive licensing rights to products and pay a nominal royalty (2-5%) of gross sales to the product developer; § Joint Venture Projects - The Company would share costs of production, marketing and distribution and would share revenues with product developers; and § Straight Royalty Arrangements - The Company would partially finance the infomercials in exchange for a fixed royalty on gross sales. Of course, the key to our ability to continually attract new products and new product developers will, in large part, determine our success. As part of our strategy, we intend to, and have developed, strategic alliances with strong companies that are established operators in the infomercial and advertising industry. Our business is focused on improving shareholder returns with a particular emphasis on profitability and capital productivity. Economic and market conditions have been, and continue to be, disruptive and volatile. The availability and cost of credit and currency volatility have obviously contributed to diminished expectations for the economy. These conditions, along with reduced consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have contributed to reductions in consumer spending, particularly on discretionary products such as the ones offered by DM Products. 45 Table of Contents Although we continually adjust our procurement, marketing and production schedules, together with an acute awareness of production costs, it is still uncertain as to when the economy will recover, and it is not clear that our current activities will sufficiently offset the impact of the poor economy on our net sales. Plan of Operation Since its acquisition of Direct Success, Inc. in July, 2005 (pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement more fully described elsewhere in this document), we have focused primarily on the manufacturing, marketing, sale, and distribution of the Banjo Minnow Fishing Lure System (“Banjo Minnow”), via a direct marketing campaign, primarily promoted through the production and airing of a thirty minute infomercial. The exclusive rights to the Banjo Minnow were acquired through a Manufacturing, Marketing and Distribution Agreement entered into between Direct Success, LLC#3 and Banjo Buddies, Inc., dated October 10, 2003 (prior to the company’s acquisition of Direct Success, Inc.). Direct Success, Inc., on or about August 16, 2003, entered into a joint venture with Buena Vista Infomercial Corporation and formed Direct Success, LLC #3 (a Delaware Limited Liability Company) for the purpose of acquiring the exclusive manufacturing and distribution rights to the Banjo Minnow. Direct Success, LLC #3 is 75% owned by Direct Success, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of DM Products, Inc.), while the remaining 25% is owned by Buena Vista Infomercial Corporation. On or about October 10, 2003, Direct Success, LLC #3 entered into an agreement with Banjo Buddies Inc. (the owner and inventor of the lure) in which Banjo granted to Direct Success, LLC #3 the exclusive rights to manufacture, use, distribute, sell, advertise, promote and otherwise exploit the Banjo Minnow. Direct Success, Inc. produced and financed the current infomercial featuring the Banjo Minnow and invested substantial capital in its promotion. Direct Success, LLC #3 receives a royalty based on the sales of the product. On or about May 11, 2005, Direct Success, LLC #3 subcontracted the manufacturing and distribution rights to TriStar Products, Inc. Pursuant to this subcontract, Direct Success, LLC #3 receives a royalty, based on sales generated by TriStar. Diversification We realize the need to expand on the products offered to consumers, thereby diversifying our commitments and attracting new customers. Our directors and officers are consistently approached with ideas for new products from various individuals and companies. It is expected that our officers and directors will continue to be “pitched” for new product ideas and that our referral sources will grow as we gain recognition in the infomercial industry. As opportunities arise, our officers and directors will present potential product ideas to our Board of Directors for its discussion and review. In deciding which products to pursue, our Board will consider, among other things, the product's viability, costs of development and marketing, acceptable sales price point per unit, as well as the product's overall likelihood of success. In some instances, our Board may retain an outside consultant to evaluate such things as the product's likely market appeal or the product's optimal price point. We will pursue products approved by a majority vote of the Board. Although we expect that our directors and officers will continue to be approached by inventors with viable products without any solicitation, the Board of Directors may decide to solicit product pitches or ideas in the future if the Board believes that such a strategy would be in the our best interest. 46 Table of Contents If the Board approves a product for further development, we intend to retain outside parties to produce the infomercial, assist in the design, the overall marketing campaign and sales process, and source and manufacture the product for competitive rates. When determining what parties to retain for these services, our Board of Directors will consider several factors, including a proven track record, cost and the ability to meet our timetable. We do not intend to retain any one service provider exclusively, and, instead we intend to seek competitive bids from numerous potential providers for each infomercial campaign. In addition, we realize the significance of our public posture and ability to expand outside the world of direct marketing. As such, management has been engaged in discussions concerning the acquisition of additional projects that do not necessarily fit the parameters of direct marketing. Utilizing DM Products, Inc. as a “holding company” will allow us the opportunity to explore other business ventures. We believe in diversification and intend to utilize our present posture to aggressively pursue other avenues that cross our path. This model of operation has seen tremendous success with other companies. Having a company with years of operational history, minimal debt, and a management team with open eyes towards expansion, allows us this unique opportunity. Alth ough we are currently focused on direct marketing, there is no reason to limit our expansion into other areas of growth and revenue gains. General Our results of operations may vary significantly from period-to-period. Our revenues will fluctuate due to the seasonality of our products, customer buying patterns, product innovations and competition, our ability to meet customer demand, media and advertising campaigns, and our ability to attract new customers and renew existing sales relationships. In addition, our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors, including, among other things: the overall condition of the U.S. economy and economics of other countries where we market our products; and the availability of credit, both in the U.S. and abroad. Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 As stated above, for the year ended December 31, 2007, the company received revenues from part sales and revenues from the royalty arrangement between Direct Success, LLC #3 and TriStar Products, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, the company’s sole revenue has been derived through the royalty arrangement between Direct Success, LLC #3 and TriStar Products, Inc. 47 Table of Contents In year ended December 31, 2007, this resulted in $119,744 of revenue received by DM Products. In addition we received $50,236. in sales revenue from the part sales, for a total of $169,980. (Our various subsidiaries combine operations through consolidated returns). In year ended December 31, 2008, our revenue increased to $220,261. In year ended December 31, 2009, this royalty amount increased to $363,767., a $143,506 increase from 2008 (65%). For years ended 2008 and 2009 our revenues were solely based on royalty payments, thus, our cost of goods sold during this period was zero. Pursuant to recent negotiations, the contractual term of our rights concerning the Banjo Minnow will continue through January 1, 2012, with an option to extend the contract for an additional six months. We have incurred operating losses in the amounts of $157,151 for year ended December 31, 2007 and $36,595 for year ended December 31,2008. We achieved an operating income for year ended 2009 in the amount of $43,793 along with miscellaneous income of $47,277, for a total incomeof $88,670, after a $2,400 provision for income tax.. Management anticipates continued growth in operating income based on the royalty payments received on the Banjo Minnow project alone. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2009, we had total assets in the amount of $119,195, consisting of $36,729 in cash, $59,708 in Tristar Receivables, $21,454 in Prepaid Expenses, and property and equipment of $1,304. Our current liabilities as of December 31, 2009, were $56,619. Thus, we had working capital of $62,576 as of December 31, 2009. Although we have attained minimal profitable operations, we are still dependent upon future financing to pursue significant expansion. We are presently in the developing stage of our business and we can provide no assurance that we can successfully obtain additional products, or financing, that will increase our profitability. We have established a $95,000 line of credit with Bank of America and have the ability to access these funds should the need arise, or a specific opportunity present itself. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2009, there were no off balance sheet arrangements. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants We have had no changes in or disagreements with our accountants. 48 Table of Contents Directors and Executive Officers The following information sets forth the names of our current directors and executive officers, their ages as of December 31, 2009 and their present positions.

Disclosure of Commission Position of Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities In accordance with the provisions in our articles of incorporation, we will indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by law. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by cont rolling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 53 Table of Contents Certain Relationships and Related Transactions The Issuer was incorporated on March 1, 2001 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name Effective Sports Nutrition Corporation.
