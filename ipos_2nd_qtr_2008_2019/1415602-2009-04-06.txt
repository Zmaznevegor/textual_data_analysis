This summary does not contain all the information that you should consider before investing in the common stock. You should carefully read the entire prospectus, including “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements, before making an investment decision . About Our Company We were founded in the State of Delaware on September 27, 2007 as Expedite 2, Inc. On February 10, 2009 we entered into a Stock Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with John Bordynuik, Inc. (“JBI”), an Ontario corporation and each of the JBI Shareholders whereby JBI became our wholly owned subsidiary. On February 13, 2009 we filed a Certificate of Amendment changing our name to John Bordynuik, Inc. JBI is an Ontario Corporation incorporated on February 10, 2006. JBI reads high volume legacy data computer tapes for large institutions and corporations. JBI is sole sourced by NASA and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to read their 7 & 9 track computer tapes written from the 1960’s to 2000. Millions of tapes were written during this period and the data has not been recoverable to date. John Bordynuik, President of JBI, has developed the technology to read legacy data computer tapes and to extract and recover the valuable data contained therein. Mr. Bordynuik has built a reputation in legacy data recovery and has completed recovery projects for NASA, MIT, the United Nations (UN), the Ontario Provincial Government, and other institutions and Fortune-100 companies and their founders. Mr. Bordynuik has assigned this technology to JBI. Where You Can Find Us We presently lease corporate office and warehouse space located at 4536 Portage Road, Niagara Falls, Ontario Canada L2E 6A8, in the north end of Niagara Falls, five miles from two major highways, and within five to 20 miles from four major international bridges. JBI pays $6888.88 monthly for this space. Our phone number is (905) 354-7222. Our corporate office and production warehouse is located in a 32,000 square foot facility located in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Our Administration, Sales & Marketing and Research & Development team occupies 3,000 square feet, and 5,000 sq. feet is allocated for prototype, assembly and data recovery. Production, shipping and receiving are managed in the remainder of our facility. We plan to open an engineering office in Cambridge, Massachusetts near MIT. We have outsourced software and hardware engineers to assist in developing and scaling our technologies.

You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Please note that throughout this prospectus, the words “we”, “our” or “us” refer to the Company and not to the selling stockholders. WE NEED TO MANAGE GROWTH IN OPERATIONS TO MAXIMIZE OUR POTENTIAL GROWTH AND ACHIEVE OUR EXPECTED REVENUES AND OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE GROWTH WILL CAUSE A DISRUPTION OF OUR OPERATIONS RESULTING IN THE FAILURE TO GENERATE REVENUE AT LEVELS WE EXPECT. In order to maximize potential growth in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must expand our research and development efforts. This expansion will place a significant strain on our management and our operational, accounting, and information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures, and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate, and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect. COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY OR PATENT SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY, AND MAKE THIS TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. Competitors may develop similar technology and make the technology available to our current customers at a lower cost or on better contractual terms. If this were to occur our customer base would be reduced which would in turn lower our revenues. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR ORGANIC GROWTH STRATEGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL WHICH MAY RESULT IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROWTH, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. One of our strategies is to grow organically through referrals and expanding into additional business sectors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully establish our products in any additional markets. Our inability to implement this organic growth strategy successfully may have a negative impact on our growth, future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. WE HAVE LIMITED SOURCES OF CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY. Currently, our primary source of capital and liquidity has been through our existing shareholders. The Company does not have any lines of credit or other sources of capital to provide for liquidity or future expansion. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON THE PERFORMANCE AND CONTINUED SERVICE OF JOHN BORDYNUIK, OUR ONLY OFFICER AND DIRECTOR. WITHOUT HIS CONTINUED SERVICE, WE MAY BE FORCED TO INTERRUPT OR EVENTUALLY CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. We are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of John Bordynuik our only officer and director. We currently do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Bordynuik. The loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. JOHN BORDYNUIK HAS MAJORITY VOTING CONTROL OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Mr. Bordynuik has the voting proxy for 61% of the voting stock of the Company. Mr. Bordynuik controls the voting rights for the 36,308,345 shares of the 58,621,250 issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE OVERALL RISKS OR COSTS WHEN WE BID ON A CONTRACT WHICH IS ULTIMATELY AWARDED TO US, WE MAY ACHIEVE A LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED PROFIT OR INCUR A LOSS ON THE CONTRACT. Substantially all of our revenues and contract backlog are typically derived from fixed unit price contracts. Fixed unit price contracts require us to perform the contract for a fixed unit price irrespective of our actual costs. As a result, we realize a profit on these contracts only if we successfully estimate our costs and then successfully control actual costs and avoid cost overruns. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected, or may cause us to incur losses. This, in turn, could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position. The costs incurred and gross profit realized on those contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from the original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 3 • onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid; • later contract start dates than expected when we bid the contract; • contract modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders; • availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project; • fraud or theft committed by our employees; • difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals; • changes in applicable laws and regulations; and ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS OR REDUCTIONS IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING OF TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS, OR THE CANCELLATION OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS, COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our business is highly dependent on the amount of technology work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new technology related work, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and national or local government spending levels. Decreases in government funding of technology projects could decrease the number of technology related contracts available and limit our ability to obtain new contracts, which could reduce our revenues and profits. Contracts that we enter into with governmental entities can usually be canceled at any time by them with payment only for the work already completed. In addition, we could be prohibited from bidding on certain governmental contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. A sudden cancellation of a contract or our debarment from the bidding process could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. THE OFFERING PRICE OF THE SHARES SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN INDICATOR OF THE FUTURE MARKET PRICE OF THE SECURITIES. THE OFFERING PRICE BEARS NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE COMPANY, AND MAY MAKE OUR SHARES DIFFICULT TO SELL. Since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of $0.50 for the shares of common stock was determined arbitrarily by us based on an evaluation of our shares outstanding we well as our current revenues and operations.. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. The offering price bears no relationship to the book value, assets or earnings of our company or any other recognized criteria of value. The offering price should not be regarded as an indicator of the future market price of the securities. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF A PUBLIC MARKET OR THAT THE COMMON STOCK WILL EVER TRADE ON A RECOGNIZED EXCHANGE. THEREFORE, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK. There is no established public trading market for our common stock. Our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved or that a regular trading market will develop or that if developed, will be sustained. In the absence of a trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment. OUR COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED A PENNY STOCK, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY, SO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES. If our common stock becomes tradable in the secondary market, we will be subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, which in all likelihood would make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their securities. RESTRICTED SECURITIES; LIMITED TRANSFERABILITY. Our securities should be considered a long-term, illiquid investment. Our Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, and cannot be sold without registration under the Act or any exemption from registration. In addition, our Common Stock is not registered under any state securities laws that would permit their transfer. Because of these restrictions and the absence of an active trading market for the securities, a shareholder will likely be unable to liquidate an investment even though other personal financial circumstances would dictate such liquidation. 4 Item 4. Use of Proceeds. USE OF PROCEEDS The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the shares for the selling security holders. Item 5. Determination of Offering Price DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE Since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of the shares of common stock was determined arbitrarily by us based on an evaluation of our shares outstanding we well our current revenues and operations.. The offering price of the shares of our common stock does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) concurrently with the filing of this prospectus. In order to be quoted on the Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. In addition, there is no assurance that our common stock will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the common stock in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity. Item 6. Dilution. DILUTION The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. Item 7. Selling Security Holders. SELLING SHAREHOLDERS The shares being offered for resale by the selling stockholders consist of the 9,697,375 shares of our common stock held by 249 shareholders of our common stock which were purchased pursuant by these shareholders in a private placement offering. The following table sets forth the name of the selling stockholders, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each of the selling stockholders as of April 6, 2009 and the number of shares of common stock being offered by the selling stockholders. The shares being offered hereby are being registered to permit public secondary trading, and the selling stockholders may offer all or part of the shares for resale from time to time. However, the selling stockholders are under no obligation to sell all or any portion of such shares nor are the selling stockholders obligated to sell any shares immediately upon effectiveness of this prospectus. All information with respect to share ownership has been furnished by the selling stockholders.

Plan of Distribution. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The selling security holders may sell some or all of their shares at a fixed price of $0.50 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. Prior to being quoted on the OTCBB, shareholders may sell their shares in private transactions to other individuals. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) concurrently with the filing of this prospectus. In order to be quoted on the Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. However, sales by selling security holder must be made at the fixed price of $0.50 until a market develops for the stock. Once a market has been developed for our common stock, the shares may be sold or distributed from time to time by the selling stockholders directly to one or more purchasers or through brokers or dealers who act solely as agents, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices, at negotiated prices or at fixed prices, which may be changed. The distribution of the shares may be effected in one or more of the following methods: O ordinary brokers transactions, which may include long or short sales, O transactions involving cross or block trades on any securities or market where our common stock is trading, market where our common stock is trading, O through direct sales to purchasers or sales effected through agents, O through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether exchange listed of otherwise), or exchange listed or otherwise), or O any combination of the foregoing. In addition, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers who may engage in short sales, if short sales were permitted, of shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers that require the delivery by such broker-dealers of the shares, which shares may be resold thereafter pursuant to this prospectus. Brokers, dealers, or agents participating in the distribution of the shares may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal, or both (which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer may be in excess of customary commissions). Neither the selling stockholders nor we can presently estimate the amount of such compensation.

Information with Respect to the Registrant. Organization Within Last Five Years We were founded in the State of Delaware on September 27, 2007 as Expedite 2, Inc and 100,000 shares were issued to Sheila Hunter. On June 2, 2008, pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement, John Bordynuik purchased a total of 100,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock from Sheila Hunter for an aggregate of $30,000 in cash. The total of 100,000 shares represented 100% of the shares of issued and outstanding common stock of the Company at the time of transfer. On February 10, 2009 we entered into an Exchange Agreement with JBI, an Ontario corporation and each of the JBI Shareholders whereby JBI became our wholly owned subsidiary. On February 13, 2009 we filed a Certificate of Amendment changing our name to John Bordynuik, Inc. Description of Business Our wholly owned subsidiary JBI is an Ontario Corporation incorporated on February 10, 2006. JBI reads high volume legacy data computer tapes for large institutions and corporations. JBI is sole sourced by NASA and MIT to read their 7 & 9 track computer tapes written from the 1960’s to 2000. Millions of tapes were written during this period and the data has not been recoverable to date. John Bordynuik, President of JBI, has developed the technology to read legacy data computer tapes and to extract and recover the valuable data contained therein. Mr. Bordynuik has built a strong reputation in legacy data recovery and has completed recovery projects for the NASA, MIT, UN Tapes, the Ontario Provincial Government, and other institutions and Fortune-100 companies and their founders. Mr. Bordynuik has assigned this technology to JBI. JBI designed and manufactured a 40-foot mobile data recovery container complete with 18 drives, photographing stations, servers, air handling, tape dehydration systems, and rooms for tape libraries. This container is capable of reading in excess of 700 tapes per day and is designed primarily to remotely read large volumes of seismic data tapes for oil and gas as well as highly sensitive tapes for government defense departments. Mr. Bordynuik has experience cracking encryption used to store data onto tapes and deciphering data for clients; this is extremely valuable in the process of legacy data recovery and provides a value–added service to customers. Usually, JBI’s services are required to decipher tape data after recovery. All data, sensitive or private, is stored in a secure location and viewed only by JBI. JBI employs Mr. Bordynuik’s software to decipher all data and convert it to modern file formats as requested by clients. Mr. Bordynuik has developed technology to prove mechanically that the recovered data is 100% accurate. Prior to the development of this technology old media read on original equipment could not be validated and its output was generally poor. JBI’s technology is valuable to governmental and educational institutions, and in the recovery of seismic data. As an example, earth science sensor data compiled by NASA and stored on these tapes can now be viewed and studied on a single computer. At the time that these legacy tapes were written, it was not uncommon for large IBM mainframes to have 8 kilobytes of dynamic memory and no disk drive. In the past, it has not been possible to process decades of sensor data due to limited disk storage, lack of dynamic memory and limited processing power, and inability to read old tapes. From a business-unit perspective, every tape is considered a “national asset” and high volumes of paperwork, administration and storage costs are required to manage them. JBI can usually amalgamate 200,000 national assets (tapes) into one national asset (hard disk array). We have scaled to handle multiple clients and have developed a tape transcription, migration and normalization technology for the oil and gas market. To date, JBI’s business has been unsolicited. In the future, JBI will utilize existing relationships to seek new business and will seek relationships with oil and gas clients to read their seismic data tapes. JBI designed and manufactured a 40-foot Mobile Data Recovery Container complete with 18 tape drives, photographing stations, servers, air handling, tape dehydration systems, and room for tape libraries. This container is capable of reading in excess of 700 tapes per day. It is an innovative solution to remotely read large volumes of seismic data tapes for Oil and Gas as well as highly sensitive tapes for Government Defense Departments. JBI will now transport its proprietary technologies and processes directly to clients’ sites in order to read tapes that contain exceptionally sensitive data or are restricted through governmental regulations from going off-site. JBI does not use off-the-shelf-hardware and software and has the ability to design technology to recover most legacy data and most modern media. Through proprietary research and development that applies technology solutions with artificial intelligence and custom hardware, firmware and software, JBI provides the innovation necessary to be competitive in today’s market. JBI holds a US patent (7,115,872) for a dirty bomb detector and is exploring the possibilities of licensing this technology to the market. 14 JBI sponsored the IEEE Mass Storage Systems and Technologies Conference in Maryland in September 2008. Mr. Bordynuik spoke at the event to highlight JBI’s findings. The attendees are representatives from institutions in the United States and internationally. This was a significant event for JBI. Products Magnetic Computer Backup Tapes : JBI is sole sourced by institutions to read their large volume of legacy data 7 & 9 track tapes. In August 2008, JBI met with NASA to discuss further procurement requirements and to work out scheduling for the arrival of more tapes. NASA is currently arranging the shipping of the next set of tapes to JBI for data recovery. JBI has read thousands of tapes for MIT. These were written from 1960s through 1995. The scalability of our proprietary technology employed enables JBI to easily expand data recovery services for new media types. JBI will continue to use economies of scale to increase volume and lower costs. JBI will use economies of scope to provide data recovery solutions for newer types of magnetic media that include microfiche, optical and film. JBI will leverage the unique strategic alliance with Mr. Bordynuik to establish long-term licensing of technologies used in our products and services. JBI will focus on reliable and timely delivery and quality outcomes. JBI will build, strengthen and manage the JBI brand. Radiation Detection Products JBI owns a broad-based patent for a handheld and network able dirty bomb detection sensor. JBI has not built or sold any product under this patent to date. Advertising and Sales Strategy : Tapes JBI has already developed a reputation in data recovery and is sole-sourced by established institutions, governments and individuals. We hope this reputation will promote word of mouth sales and contacts. JBI has developed strategic alliances with NASA, MIT and other educational institutions as a result of Mr. Bordynuik’s 22-year track record of data recovery and reputation for being able to recovery 100% of the information from “unreadable” tapes. Strategic alliances provide on-going introductions to institutions and corporations in need of our data recovery services. JBI plans to develop and offer only the highest quality products and services. We will use patented and/or disruptive technologies. This will reduce customers’ costs and have a positive outcome. This strategy will continually differentiate us from our competitors’ products and services. This is demonstrated by “perfect reads” of tapes from NASA, the UN, MIT, the US Army, and other public and private archives. JBI has a working agreement with a seismic data library corporation regarding our ability to recover and manage their volumes of 7 & 9 track tapes. JBI has a working agreement with an oil and gas data management company and is now formalizing the scope of various projects with their oil and gas clients. JBI Senior Executives have and will continue to attend the key exhibitions and conferences for mass storage solutions to promote JBI’s data recovery solutions. VII. Competitive Advantages We are the only company capable, at this time, of reading legacy 7 & 9 track tapes 100%. Our competition will be from data recovery houses who claim to be able to read legacy data. In the past, these data recovery businesses have sent JBI requests to purchase and/or license Mr. Bordynuik’s technologies. During NASA’s procurement process, JBI received requests from various vendors to quote on subcontracting the work. NASA procured JBI through FAR 13 for tape recovery after a thorough bidding and verification process. Presently, some data recovery businesses use original equipment to recover data from old media; this is generally found to be ineffective and data is not accurate. JBI will compete against groups claiming to be able to read legacy media by emphasizing our proven track record and proven technology. JBI will achieve and maintain profitability by controlling costs. We will scale up only on an as-needed basis. 15 Employees We currently employ 15 full and part-time staff. We designs, develops and manufactures all of our data recovery equipment. We are equipped with 12 media dryers, 66 7 & 9-track tape drives, large customized and modified tape libraries to support media such as 3480, 3490, 3590, DLT, LTO, SDLT, AIT, and Exabyte, as well as many other modern cartridge formats. We have 200TB of storage and various server clusters for processing. We have packaged internal data conversion and management systems into one plug-and-play solution for clients with large datasets. We designed and manufactured a 40-foot Mobile Data Recovery Container complete with 18 tape drives, photographing stations, servers, air handling, tape dehydration systems, and room for tape libraries. This container is capable of reading in excess of 700 tapes per day. It is an innovative solution to remotely read large volumes of seismic data tapes for oil and gas as well as highly sensitive tapes for government defense departments. We will now transport our proprietary technologies and processes directly to clients’ sites in order to read tapes that contain exceptionally sensitive data or are restricted through governmental regulations from going off-site. We have an infrastructure to support data acquisition, processing and output. Our development lab includes a 144-core distributed processing and file-serving cluster with 100TB of temporary storage. We utilize a “Cray-on-a-chip” development platform to migrate designs to hardware after thoroughly proven in software. We have a fully equipped machine shop. Risk of data loss is mitigated through the use of a secure offsite backup storage facility. We have manufactured additional tape drives for the oil and gas sector. We have a large engineering, math and solutions archive onsite.

F-7 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2009 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION John Bordynuik, Inc. (the “Company”), formerly known as Expedite 2, Inc. , was incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 27, 2007 and is headquartered in Niagara Falls, Canada. The Company has developed technology to read legacy data computer tapes and to extract and recover the valuable data contained therein. The technology developed cracks encryption used to store data onto tapes and deciphering data for clients in the process of legacy data recovery usually deciphering tape data after recovery. All data, sensitive or private, is stored in a secure location and viewed only by the Company. The Company employs its software to decipher all data and convert it to modern file formats as requested by clients. On February 10, 2009 the Company entered into a merger agreement with the subsidiary Company, John Bordynuik, Inc., a Canadian company. The company accounted for this as a reverse merger, into an inactive company, Expedite 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation, whereby Expedite 2, Inc. changed its name to John Bordynuik, Inc. The exchange of stock was for 100 % of the issued and outstanding shares of the subsidiary company, the Company issued 58,521,250 common shares to the shareholders of the subsidiary company acquirement of their shares, or 234,085 shares, or 250 shares for each share. From inception, September 27, 2007 to the date of closing, the Company had no operations and was actively looking for an operating company to merge with or acquire. The Company has adopted a July 31 fiscal year end. NOTE 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, since inception the Company has incurred cumulative net realized losses. Since inception, the Company’s management have indicated their continued support for the Company; however, there can be no assurance these activities will be successful. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to seek both public and private debt and equity funding. NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a. Cash For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. b. Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and net realizable value determined on a specific item basis. F-8 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2009 c. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and current liabilities, approximate their fair values at July 31, 2008 and 2007. d. Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company. Its operating subsidiary uses the Canadian dollar. The Canadian subsidiary operations are translated into the U.S. dollar as if it operated using U.S. dollars by the temporal method of currency translation. All foreign currency asset and liability amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at year end-of-period exchange rates, except for inventories, prepaid expenses and property, plant, and equipment, which are remeasured at historical rates. Foreign currency income and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during the year, except for expenses related to balance sheet amounts which are translated at historical exchange rates. Net remeasurement gains and losses of foreign currency translation adjustments are shown as part of equity and are also shown in comprehensive income. e. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are accounted for at cost and not amortized. Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. The impairment test consists in comparison of the fair value of assets and/or cash inflows derived from the asset with its carrying value. When the carrying value exceeds these values an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess f. Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The number of weighted average shares outstanding as well as the amount of net income per share is the same for basic and diluted per share calculations for all periods reflected in the accompanying financial statements. g. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires the use of the "liability method". Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Current income taxes are based on the income that is currently taxable. h. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. i. Advertising Costs The Company expenses advertising costs when the advertisement occurs. F-9 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2009 j. Recognition of Revenue Revenue and cost reported to date is realized from the subsidiary’s operations and recognized on the accrual basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. k. Common Stock Recorded as Compensation The Company does not have an employee stock compensation package set up at this time. The stock compensation that may be granted would fall under Rule 144. Compliance with Rule 144 is discussed in the following paragraph. In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who has beneficially owned shares of a company's common stock for at least one year is entitled to sell within any three month period a number of shares 1% of the number of shares of the company's common stock then outstanding. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about the company. Effective February 15, 2008, the holding period requirement under Rule 144 for ‘‘restricted securities’’ of issuers that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is shortened to six months. Restricted securities of issuers that are not subject to the Exchange Act reporting requirements will continue to be subject to a one-year holding period prior to any public resale. l. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-6-1, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” The FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method. The FSP affects entities that accrue dividends on share-based payment awards during the awards’ service period when the dividends do not need to be returned if the employees forfeit the award. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an entity's Own Stock In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-5, "Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock" (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the instrument's contingent exercise and settlement provisions. It also clarifies on the impact of foreign currency denominated strike prices and market-based employee stock option valuation instruments on the evaluation. EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of EITF 07-5 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. F-10 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2009 Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement).” The FSP clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion. The FSP requires issuers to account separately for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. The FSP requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The FSP requires retrospective application to the terms of instruments as they existed for all periods presented. The FSP is effective as of January 1, 2009 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of FSP APB 14-1 upon its consolidated financial statements. The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" (FAS No.162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations. Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets In April 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position on Financial Accounting Standard (“FSP FAS”) No. 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”, which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of intangible assets under SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of the expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) “Business Combinations” and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of FSP FAS No. 142-3 on its consolidated financial statements. Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “ Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , an amendment of SFAS No. 133”, (SFAS 161). This statement requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of SFAS No. 161 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Delay in Effective Date In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”. This FSP delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact of adoption was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. F-11 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2009 Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141(R)). This Statement replaces the original SFAS No. 141. This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which SFAS No. 141 called the purchase method ) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The objective of SFAS No. 141(R) is to improve the relevance, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a. Recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. b. Recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase. c. Determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and may not be applied before that date. The Company does not expect the effect that its adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS No. 160). This Statement amends the original Accounting Review Board (ARB) No. 51 “Consolidated Financial Statements” to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and may not be applied before that date. The Company does not expect the effect that its adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an amendment of SFAS No. 115” (SFAS No. 159), which becomes effective for the Company on February 1, 2008, permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses in earnings. Such accounting is optional and is generally to be applied instrument by instrument. The Company does not anticipate that the election, of this fair-value option will have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures. F-12 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2009 Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 addresses the requests from investors for expanded disclosure about the extent to which companies’ measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The Company is unable at this time to determine the effect that its adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" (SFAS No. 154), which replaces Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28”. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections, and it establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS No. 154 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. NOTE 4 NOTE RECEIVABLE On October 10, 2008, the Company loaned cash in the amount $50,000 to a shareholder in the form of a loan agreement whereby the note was collateralized by 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The note requires the shareholder to repay the note one month after the Company becomes publically traded. A nominal amount of interest at 3% per year is imputed on the principal balance and accrued until such time the note is paid. NOTE 5 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided for under the declining balance method at rates which are designated to charge the cost of property, plant and equipment to expense over their estimated useful lives. In the year of acquisition, one-half of the normal rate is used. NOTE 6 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS From time to time shareholders may loan the Company money for operating needs. These are accounted for as demand notes whereby interest is imputed as there is no stated rate carried on the notes. The Company had a demand note payable with the Company’s President for the amounts owed the President for a technology agreement and a patent agreement. The balance of this note at January 31, 2009 was $160,197.

These financial statements are the responsibility of company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statements presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of John Bordnyuik, Inc. at July 31, 2008 and 2007 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2008 and 2007 in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

F-7 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JULY 31, 2008 and 2007 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION John Bordynuik, Inc. (the “Company”), formerly known as Expedite 2, Inc. , was incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 27, 2007 and is headquartered in Niagara Falls, Canada. The Company has developed technology to read legacy data computer tapes and to extract and recover the valuable data contained therein. The technology developed cracks encryption used to store data onto tapes and deciphering data for clients in the process of legacy data recovery usually deciphering tape data after recovery. All data, sensitive or private , is stored in a secure location and viewed only by the Company. The Company employs its software to decipher all data and convert it to modern file formats as requested by clients. On February 10, 2009 the Company entered into a merger agreement with the subsidiary Company, John Bordynuik, Inc., a Canadian company. The company accounted for this as a reverse merger, into an inactive company, Expedite 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation, whereby Expedite 2, Inc. changed its name to John Bordynuik, Inc. The exchange of stock was for 100 % of the issued and outstanding shares of the subsidiary company, the Company issued 58,521,250 common shares to the shareholders of the subsidiary company acquirement of their shares, or 234,085 shares, or 250 shares for each share. From inception, September 27, 2007 to the date of closing, the Company had no operations and was actively looking for an operating company to merge with or acquire. The Company has adopted a July 31 fiscal year end. NOTE 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, since inception the Company has incurred cumulative net realized losses. Since inception, the Company’s management have indicated their continued support for the Company; however, there can be no assurance these activities will be successful. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to seek both public and private debt and equity funding. NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a. Cash For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. b. Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and net realizable value determined on a specific item basis. F-8 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JULY 31, 2008 and 2007 b. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and current liabilities, approximate their fair values at July 31, 2008 and 2007. c. Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company. Its operating subsidiary uses the Canadian dollar. The Canadian subsidiary operations are translated into the U.S. dollar as if it operated using U.S. dollars by the temporal method of currency translation. All foreign currency asset and liability amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at year end-of-period exchange rates, except for inventories, prepaid expenses and property, plant, and equipment, which are remeasured at historical rates. Foreign currency income and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during the year, except for expenses related to balance sheet amounts which are translated at historical exchange rates. Net remeasurement gains and losses of foreign currency translation adjustments are shown as part of equity and are also shown in comprehensive income. d. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are accounted for at cost and not amortized. Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. The impairment test consists in comparison of the fair value of assets and/or cash inflows derived from the asset with its carrying value. When the carrying value exceeds these values an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess e. Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The number of weighted average shares outstanding as well as the amount of net income per share is the same for basic and diluted per share calculations for all periods reflected in the accompanying financial statements. f. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires the use of the "liability method". Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Current income taxes are based on the income that is currently taxable. g. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. h. Advertising Costs The Company expenses advertising costs when the advertisement occurs. F-9 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JULY 31, 2008 and 2007 i. Recognition of Revenue Revenue and cost s reported to date is realized from the subsidiary’s operations and recognized on the accrual basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. j. Common Stock Recorded as Compensation The Company does not have an employee stock compensation package set up at this time. The stock compensation that may be granted would fall under Rule 144. Compliance with Rule 144 is discussed in the following paragraph. In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who has beneficially owned shares of a company's common stock for at least one year is entitled to sell within any three month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of: 1. 1% of the number of shares of the company's common stock then outstanding. 2. The average weekly trading volume of the company's common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on form 144 with respect to the sale. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about the company. Effective February 15, 2008, the holding period requirement under Rule 144 for ‘‘restricted securities’’ of issuers that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is shortened to six months. Restricted securities of issuers that are not subject to the Exchange Act reporting requirements will continue to be subject to a one-year holding period prior to any public resale. k. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-6-1, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” The FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method. The FSP affects entities that accrue dividends on share-based payment awards during the awards’ service period when the dividends do not need to be returned if the employees forfeit the award. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an entity's Own Stock In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-5, "Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock" (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the instrument's contingent exercise and settlement provisions. It also clarifies on the impact of foreign currency denominated strike prices and market-based employee stock option valuation instruments on the evaluation. EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of EITF 07-5 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. F-10 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JULY 31, 2008 and 2007 Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement).” The FSP clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion. The FSP requires issuers to account separately for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. The FSP requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The FSP requires retrospective application to the terms of instruments as they existed for all periods presented. The FSP is effective as of January 1, 2009 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of FSP APB 14-1 upon its consolidated financial statements. The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" (FAS No.162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations. Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets In April 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position on Financial Accounting Standard (“FSP FAS”) No. 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”, which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of intangible assets under SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of the expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) “Business Combinations” and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of FSP FAS No. 142-3 on its consolidated financial statements. Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “ Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , an amendment of SFAS No. 133”, (SFAS 161). This statement requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of SFAS No. 161 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Delay in Effective Date In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”. This FSP delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact of adoption was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. F-11 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JULY 31, 2008 and 2007 Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141(R)). This Statement replaces the original SFAS No. 141. This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which SFAS No. 141 called the purchase method ) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The objective of SFAS No. 141(R) is to improve the relevance, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a. Recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. b. Recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase. c. Determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and may not be applied before that date. The Company does not expect the effect that its adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS No. 160). This Statement amends the original Accounting Review Board (ARB) No. 51 “Consolidated Financial Statements” to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and may not be applied before that date. The Company does not expect the effect that its adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an amendment of SFAS No. 115” (SFAS No. 159), which becomes effective for the Company on February 1, 2008, permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses in earnings. Such accounting is optional and is generally to be applied instrument by instrument. The Company does not anticipate that the election, of this fair-value option will have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures. F-12 JOHN BORDYNUIK, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JULY 31, 2008 and 2007 Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 addresses the requests from investors for expanded disclosure about the extent to which companies’ measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The Company is unable at this time to determine the effect that its adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" (SFAS No. 154), which replaces Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28”. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections, and it establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS No. 154 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. NOTE 4 NOTE RECEIVABLE On October 10, 2008, the Company loaned to a shareholder cash in the amount $50,000 in the form of a loan agreement whereby the note was collateralized by 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The note requires the shareholder to repay the note one month after the Company becomes publically traded. A nominal amount of interest at 3% per year is imputed on the principal balance and accrued until such time the note is paid. NOTE 5 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property , plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided for under the declining balance method at rates which are designated to charge the cost of property, plant and equipment to expense over their estimated useful lives.

These are accounted for as demand notes whereby interest is imputed as there is no stated rate is interest carried on the notes. The Company had a demand note payable with the Company’s President for the amounts owed the President for a technology agreement and a patent agreement. The balance of this note at July 31, 2008 and 2007 was $213,253 and $341,022, respectively.

Plan of Operation Our management team has grown JBI organically. We are a niche market company focused on high quality legacy data recovery as well as the manufacture and marketing of Mr. Bordynuik’s inventions. We do not need to raise additional capital in order to continue in business for the first two years, even without revenue. We have $2,650,000 cash on hand and have accounts receivable from NASA for $39,500. The volume in tapes from NASA is growing as our relationship progresses. Mr. Bordynuik has a history cracking encryption used to store data onto tapes and deciphering data for clients; this is valuable in the process of legacy data recovery and provides a value–added service to customers. Usually, our services are required to decipher tape data after recovery. All data, sensitive or private, is stored in a secure location and viewed only by our employees. We employ Mr. Bordynuik’s software to decipher all data and convert it to modern file formats as requested by clients. We do not use off-the-shelf-hardware and software and have the ability to design technology to recover most legacy data and most modern media. Through proprietary research and development that applies technology solutions with artificial intelligence and custom hardware, firmware and software, we will provide the innovation necessary to be competitive in today’s market. We hold a US patent for a dirty bomb detector and is exploring the possibilities of bringing this device to market. Tapes The following is a summary of the expected revenue and costs resulting from the production of 18,000 tapes per month (one truckload): Revenue : Per tape cost to customer to recover data (volume order of 18,000 tapes per month) is $25/tape. Per tape cost to customer to shred tape (volume order of 18,000 tapes per month). We can read one tape every 15 minutes per drive. Total cost to customer: $25/tape JBI costs incl. expenditures/tape (1 shift): $14/tape Total revenue/18,000 tapes: $450,000.00 Gross Profit per truckload of tapes: $198,000.00 Expenditures : Salaries: $736,000.00 Office Rent: $82,666.00 Accounting: $50,000.00 Legal: $50,000.00 Patents: $50,000.00 Total: $968,666.00 Salaries: Senior Executive Team: $ 440,000.00 Research & Development 100,000.00 Salary to 2 Data Recovery Technologists $74,000.00 Contracted employees: $60,000.00 Benefits: $80,000.00 Sub Total: $754,000.00 SR&ED tax credits: $168,000.00 Total: $ 586,000.00 18 *** The salaries for Research and Development and equipment purchased for research and development qualify for a 40 per cent Canadian SR & ED tax credit.

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2007 and 100,000 shares of common stock were issued to Sheila Hunter in consideration for $100. These shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) and were issued as founders shares. These shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a “public offering” as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of shares offered. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors. In addition, the investor had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction. In February 2009 we entered into a Stock Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement with John Bordynuik, Inc., (“JBI”) an Ontario Corporation, whereby we exchanged 58,521,250 shares of common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of JBI, to the individuals listed below. These shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a “public offering” as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of shares offered. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors. In addition, the individuals had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction. 1264282 Ontario Ltd.
