The summary financial data should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. You should read the following financial information together with the information under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements, appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Statement of operations data: Net Sales $432,839 $577,085 Net Earnings (Loss) ($42,017) ($2,920) Balance sheet data: Total assets $127,944 $109,900 Current Liabilities $64,082 $42,161 Long-term obligations $47,674 $69,534 RISK FACTORS This Offering involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before you decide to purchase the shares of common stock offered hereby. Risks Related To Our Business Our business is subject to numerous risk factors, including the following: WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY THAT YOU CAN USE TO EVALUATE US, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR SUCCESS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE PROBLEMS, EXPENSES, DIFFICULTIES, COMPLICATIONS AND DELAYS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED BY A SMALL COMPANY. We were incorporated in Florida on July 7, 2006. We have a limited amount of assets or financial resources. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the expenses and difficulties in marketing our services to our clients. Since we have a limited operating history of marketing our services to the public, we may not be able to continue to operate profitably or to grow our business. OUR LABOR COSTS MAY INCREASE WITH A POTENTIAL SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. Labor costs accounted for approximately 64% of the operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2007 and 53% in 2008. We compete with other construction companies to attract and retain qualified or skilled personnel. We also compete with various industries for lower-wage employees. If a shortage of construction workers occurred in the region in which we operate, it could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and could further increase our operating costs. 7 THE NATURE OF OUR CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CONTRACT DISPUTES WHICH MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITS. Although we have not been party to any legal claims against us, we may in future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters. If it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for us, which claims may reduce our profits and cash available for operations. LOSS OF ANY ONE OF OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 65% of our revenues in 2007 and 72% in 2008. Loss of one of these larger customers could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. WE ARE VULNERABLE TO THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS. The housing market in Florida, in many areas, is exhibiting declines in prices and the volume of home sales. This decline in the Florida real estate market may adversely affect the demand for our services. As a result of real estate market conditions, our operating results may vary, depending upon the demand for future projects in the housing markets we serve. INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY COULD REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE AND PROFITS. We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of installation and remodeling companies compete. Competition will also place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to grow our company with acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits. IF WE EXPERIENCE DELAYS AND/OR DEFAULTS IN CUSTOMER PAYMENTS, WE COULD SUFFER LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS OR WE COULD BE UNABLE TO RECOVER ALL EXPENDITURES. Because of the nature of our contracts, at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred. Delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment. If a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources, it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations. WE COULD FACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS . Although we have no plans at this time to access the capital markets to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities, our ability to access the capital markets would be subject to various factors, including general economic and/or financial market conditions. The current conditions of the financial markets have adversely affected the availability of credit and liquidity resources and our access to capital markets is more limited until stability re-emerges in these markets. 8 Risks Related to This Offering WE HAVE INCURRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR INCREASED COSTS AS A RESULT OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY. As a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company. We will continue to incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The Nasdaq National Market. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. BECAUSE CERTAIN EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OWN A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR VOTING STOCK, OTHER STOCKHOLDERS' VOTING POWER MAY BE LIMITED. Our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own or control approximately 66% of our Common Stock. As a result, if those stockholders act together, they will have the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. These stockholders may make decisions that are adverse to your interests. See our discussion under the caption in “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters” for more information about ownership of our outstanding shares. WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our Common Stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. WE DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA TO LIST OUR SECURITIES ON AN EXCHANGE SUCH AS THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET AND OUR COMMON STOCK IS ILLIQUID AND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SELL. There is no market for our common stock at this time and, following the offering made by this prospectus, there is no assurance that any market will develop for our common stock. We plan to list our common stock for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board when the distribution and potential market for the stock would permit such listing, although there is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this listing. Generally, securities that are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board lack liquidity and analyst coverage. This may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained if we met the criteria to list our securities on a larger or more established exchange, such as The NASDAQ National Market, and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock. In addition, if there is only limited trading activity in our common stock, we may not be able to have these securities qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. The relatively small trading volume would likely make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their common stock as, and when, they choose. As a result, investors may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock publicly at the time and prices that they feel are fair or appropriate. 9 BECAUSE OUR STOCK IS DEEMED A "PENNY STOCK," YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Our common stock is a "penny stock" and is therefore subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under this rule, broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The penny stock rules severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market, and many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. As a result, there is generally less trading in penny stocks and you may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock publicly at the time and prices that you feel are fair or appropriate. Under applicable regulations, our common stock will generally remain a penny stock until and for such time as its per-share price is $5.00 or more (as determined in accordance with SEC regulations), or until we meet certain net asset or revenue thresholds. These thresholds include the possession of net tangible assets (that is, total assets less intangible assets and liabilities) in excess of $5,000,000, and the recognition of average revenues equal to at least $6,000,000 for each of the last three years. We do not anticipate meeting any of the thresholds in the foreseeable future. 10 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this prospectus that are forward-looking in nature are based on the current beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management, including statements related to the markets for our products, general trends in our operations or financial results, plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs.

(“we”, “us”, the “Company” or “Royal Style Design”) was incorporated in the State of Florida on July 7, 2006. We specialize in customized surface installation solutions for floors, walls and other parts of the home using wood, glass, stone and ceramic tile in custom designed homes throughout central Florida. We have one current project in the Bahamas. Our business is not seasonal. Since 2006, Royal Style Design has supplied tile, stone and wood surface installation services for new homes and homes being remodeled in the Central Florida area. Our principals, Nikolay Lobachev, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dmitry Terikov, our Chief Operating Officer, and Ivan Sorokoumov, our Chief Financial Officer, have been working together as a team over the past seven years developing expertise and a broad experience in our business. Our management travels regularly to Europe in order to keep up with the most up to date products and design styles, with the goal of being able to create designs that capture the styles, personalities and needs of the homeowner, with an emphasis on classic European design. We review the specific needs of our client and, based on those needs, recommend the best way to achieve for the client a one-of-a-kind design. Services Provided by Our Company We are a custom tile and stone installation company that specializes in ceramic, porcelain, marble, pavers and natural stone installation in existing structures for ceilings, bathrooms, walls, floors, kitchen counters, stairways, outside terraces and pool moldings. Most of the work we do is stonework on floors and walls. We also remodel kitchens (not including building or remodeling cabinets), showers and baths, and install wood and laminate flooring. 11 We do not build homes or additions, or install terraces or pools, or do structural work, but we do our surface installation in different materials in homes that have been constructed. We have started working in commercial buildings, mostly floors and walls. We serve a diverse range of residential clients and builders; most of our clients are builders, which accounted for approximately 95% of our revenues in 2007 and 92% in 2008. We do not have any governmental clients. We use professionals with whom we work regularly to assist in the design and installation processes. We have eight sub-contractor companies with which we work regularly, and each of these companies has approximately three to six employees. No one builder accounted for more than 25% of our revenues in 2007 and 29% in 2008; our five largest customers accounted for approximately 65% of our revenues in 2007 and 72% in 2008. M ost of our business comes from referrals from our satisfied customers. Sources of Materials for Our Installation Services We obtain tiles, stone, pavers, marble, porcelain and wood from a number of different local sources, including the large home remodeling and supply stores, The Home Depot and Lowes. Our installation material supplies are readily available from a large number of sources. Payments for Services at our Company We provide a written estimate for services requested by a client. After the client agrees to the estimate, we commence working on their project. All but approximately ten percent of our clients’ projects require multiple surface installations. We bill as each stage of the installation is completed, and our invoices are due within two weeks of receipt. Insurance We carry general liability insurance with coverage of $1,000,000 for each occurrence, $1,000,000 personal injury insurance, and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, in addition to workers compensation and employers liability insurance and commercial vehicle insurance for three pickup trucks owned by the Company. Competition We experience competition from other installation and remodeling companies and individual subcontractors. While there is significant competition, we have concentrated on providing better services to our clients. Our niche market is maintained through customized products and services. There are approximately 40 tile installation companies in the Orlando area, but there are only five that we consider able to provide similar installation services based on both quality and cost. We believe that two of these five competitors are significantly larger than us. Governmental Regulation We are subject to the State of Florida Workers Compensation laws and carry workers compensation insurance. We have a business license issued by the City of Altamonte Springs, Florida. 12 Our Market Strategy We primarily rely on word of mouth referrals for new business. However, we also advertise in the “Orlando” magazine, participate in Central Florida builders competitions, such as the “Street of Dreams”, use door-to-door flyers and have telephone directory listings. We have a corporate website that briefly describes our company’s services. Information on our website is not a part of or incorporated in this registration statement. Employees We currently have six employees, our President and CEO, our Chief Operating Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and three installers. 13 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, and notes thereto, included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Overview The Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on July 7, 2006. We specialize in customized surface installation solutions for floors, walls and other parts of the home using wood, glass, stone and ceramic tile in custom designed homes throughout central Florida. YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 Revenues Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $432,839 and $557,085, respectively. Cost of Sales C ost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $305,391 and $428,046, respectively. In 2008 the officers of the company took dividends totaling in the amount of $99,255. In 2007 the officers of the company took dividends totaling in the amount of $159,348. Income from Operations During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred a net loss of $42,017, as compared with net loss of $2,920, for 2007, the decreased income being primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses from approximately $167,802 in 2008 to $129,827 in 2007, and a decrease in net sales from $432,839 for the year ended December 31, 2008, to $557,085 for the year ended December 31, 2007, coupled with a decrease in cost of sales from $305,391 in 2008 to $428,046 in 2007. The 23% decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily due to a decrease in new home sales, used home remodeling and construction markets. We also had a decrease in the cost of sales, but this decrease was proportionate to the decrease in gross sales. Our increase in general and administrative expenses in 2008 is attributable to many factors that were not present in the previous year including legal expenses of $7,666, accounting and auditing expenses involved with the filing of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of $39,411. We also had an additional expense for stock issued to consultants for services of $13,808. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred an overall decrease in net income due to a substantial increase in general and administrative expenses as compared to the overall increase in gross sales. The decrease in sales was primarily due to a decrease in sales of the housing market in our area of operation, a decrease in new home building and used home remodeling construction and a decrease in commercial construction, resulting in part from a decrease in bank lending, an increase in the bank loan interest rates which decreased new mortgages and the ability for current homeowners to finance remodeling. The construction slowdown also increased the number of local companies available to compete for jobs as well as decreased the profit margins of companies trying to compete in the declining market. 14 Liquidity and Capital Resources We had working capital deficit of $16,912 and stockholders' equity in the amount of $89,105 at December 31, 2008. We have three outstanding loans for company trucks of which total outstanding balance of $71,152 was owed as of December 31, 2008, and payments totaling $1,917 per month are as follows: for the 2006 Toyota Tundra purchased in December 2006 the monthly payment is $626.95 monthly payment for a 60 month term; for the 2006 Toyota Tundra purchased in December 2006 the monthly payment is $626.95 monthly payment for a 60 month term; and for the 2006 Toyota Tundra purchased in January 2007 the monthly payment is $642.54 for a 66 month term. Previously our only sources of liquidity were from our service revenues. On April 29, 2009, we closed a private placement offering of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, and received gross proceeds of $100,000 which, after expenses of the offering of approximately $2,700, will be used to pay our outstanding accounts payable (approximately $78,000 total), as well as to increase our marketing efforts to developers, builders and construction companies similar to those with which we work now (approximately $500). Approximately $1,500 would also be used to increase the geographic range of our current advertising campaigns by producing more marketing materials such as the brochures which we currently use and possibly targeted direct mail. In addition, we plan to purchase a trailer for approximately $3,000 enabling us to increase the number and scope of projects we work on to increase our service revenue. We believe that the additional capital so obtained for our business to operate profitably and be able to expand in the current housing environment in Florida. Off−Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off−balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. Inflation It is the opinion of the Company that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our plan of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. Note 1 to our audited Financial Statements included in this Registration Statement discusses of the most significant policies we apply, or intend to apply, in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 15 The principal accounting policy potentially subject to change as a result of our business operations is that relating to the treatment of our receivables and the related allowance for doubtful accounts that would be shown on our balance sheet. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company’s historical losses, the existing economic conditions in the construction industry and the financial ability of its customers. The Company believes that no allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary at December 31, 2008 and 2007. However, in the future we may have to make provision for an allowance for doubtful accounts depending on the financial strength of the customers that owe us payments, as well as our estimate of economic conditions generally in the areas where we operate. New Financial Accounting Standards In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS 157-1, “Application of SFAS No. 157 to SFAS No. 13 and Its Related Interpretative Accounting Pronouncements that Address Leasing Transactions” (“FSP SFAS 157-1”) and FASB Staff Position SFAS 157-2, “Effective Date of SFAS No. 157” (“FSP SFAS 157-2”). FSP SFAS 157-1 excludes SFAS No. 13 and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions from the requirements of SFAS No. 157, with the exception of fair value measurements of assets and liabilities recorded as a result of a lease transaction but measured pursuant to other pronouncements within the scope of SFAS No. 157. FSP SFAS 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). FSP SFAS 157-1 and FSP SFAS 157-2 became effective for the Company upon adoption of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008. The Company will provide the additional disclosures required relating to the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities when it fully implements SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2009, as required, and does not believe they will have a significant impact on its financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” (“SFAS 159”) providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. It also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the Company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) (“SFAS 141 (R)”) “Business Combinations”, which replaces SFAS 141 “Business Combinations”. This Statement improves the relevance, completeness and representational faithfulness of the information provided in financial reports about the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination. This Statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the Statement. Under SFAS 141(R), acquisition-related costs, including restructuring costs, must be recognized separately from the acquisition and will generally be expensed as incurred. That replaces SFAS 141’s cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. SFAS 141(R) shall be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual report period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company will implement this Statement in 2009. 16 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . Commodity Risk – Our raw material costs for our installations, in the normal course of business, could be affected by increased commodity prices for tile, stone, wood and other materials that we use.

The named selling shareholders includes donees, pledgees, transferees or other successors-in-interest who may receive shares of our common stock from the named selling shareholders after the date of this prospectus. These donees, pledgees, transferees or successors-in-interest, if any, will be named in a supplement to this prospectus if they desire to transfer any shares of our common stock. The selling shareholders will act independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale of the shares of our common stock covered by this prospectus. They may offer their respective shares of common stock at various times in one or more of the following transactions: • in ordinary brokerage transactions on market or trading facility on which the shares of common stock are traded; • in the over-the-counter market; • in private transactions; • by pledge to secure debts and other obligations; or • in a combination of any of the above transactions or by any other legally available means. The selling shareholders may sell their shares of common stock at the price of $0.05 which is a fixed price at which the selling shareholders may sell their shares until our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, at which time the shares may be sold at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices or at fixed prices. They may, but need not, use broker-dealers to sell their shares of common stock. If broker-dealers are used, such broker-dealers will either receive discounts or commissions from the selling shareholders or the subsequent purchasers of the shares of common stock, or they will receive commissions from purchasers for whom they acted as agents. The selling shareholders also may resell all or a portion of the shares of common stock in open market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, assuming the required holding period and the other conditions of that Rule are met. The selling shareholders and the broker-dealers to or through whom sales of their shares of common stock may be made could be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of Securities Act, and their commissions or discounts and other compensation received in connection with the sale of the shares may be regarded as underwriters’ compensation. The selling shareholders also may sell the shares of common stock pursuant to Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. The selling shareholders have not advised us of any specific plans for the distribution of the shares of common stock covered by this prospectus. When and if we are notified by any selling shareholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer or underwriter for the sale of a material portion of the shares of common stock covered by this prospectus, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part will be filed with the SEC. This amendment will include the following information: • the name of the participating broker-dealers or underwriters; • the identity and amount of shares of common stock involved; • the price or prices at which the shares of common stock were sold by the named selling shareholder; 26 • the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed by the named selling shareholder to the broker-dealers or underwriters which may exceed customary amounts; and • other material information. We have advised the named selling shareholders that the anti-manipulation rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, including Regulation M promulgated thereunder, may apply to sales of the shares of common stock offered by them. These provisions may restrict certain activities of, and limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares of common stock by, the selling shareholders or any other such person. In the event that the selling shareholders are deemed affiliated purchasers or distribution participants within the meaning of Regulation M, then the named selling shareholders will not be permitted to engage in short sales of the shares of common stock. Furthermore, under Regulation M, persons engaged in a distribution of shares of common stock are prohibited from simultaneously engaging in market making and certain other activities with respect to such shares of common stock for a period of time prior to the commencement of such distributions, subject to specified exceptions or exemptions. We have agreed to pay all costs relating to the registration of the shares of common stock. Any commissions or other fees payable to broker-dealers or otherwise in connection with any sale of the shares of common stock will be paid by the named selling shareholders or other party selling the shares of common stock. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES General Our authorized capital stock consists of 110,000,000 shares of which 100,000,000 are common stock, par value $.001 per share and 10,000,000 are preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. As of April 29, 2009, we had 6,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Pacific Stock Transfer Company, Las Vegas, Nevada. The following statements set forth the material terms of our classes of authorized stock; however, reference is made to the more detailed provisions of, and such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, our Articles of Incorporation, as amended. Common Stock Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available therefore. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata all assets remaining after payment in full of all liabilities. All of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase our common stock. There are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock. 27 The Board of Directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or stock exchange rules. Preferred Stock The Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. As of April 29, 2009, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Rule 144 Rule 144 under the Securities Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for resales of "restricted securities," which are securities that have been acquired from the issuer of the securities or an affiliate of the issuer in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving a public offering, and for resales of any securities held by an affiliate of the issuer. In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated), including an affiliate, who beneficially owns restricted securities of a reporting company may not sell these securities until the person has beneficially owned them for at least six months. Thereafter, affiliates may sell those securities, but only if they comply with certain restrictions relating to the manner of sale, the availability of current public information about the reporting company, and the filing of a notice of sale. In addition, under Rule 144, affiliates may not sell within any three-month period a number of shares in excess of the greater of: • 1% of the total number of securities of the same class then outstanding (approximately 65,000 shares of common stock); and • the average weekly trading volume of such securities as reported through the automated quotation system during the four calendar weeks preceding the date on which notice of the sale is filed with the SEC. Persons not deemed to be affiliates of the reporting company who have beneficially owned the restricted securities for at least six months but for less than one year may sell these securities, provided that the reporting company is current in its Exchange Act filings. After beneficially owning restricted securities for one year, a non-affiliate of the reporting company may engage in unlimited resales of such securities. 28 After the date of this prospectus, a maximum of 6,500,000 shares of our common stock outstanding after the offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except that any securities held by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, must generally be sold in compliance with the limitations of Rule 144 described above.

CPA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors Royal Style Design, Inc. Altamonte Springs, FL 32701 We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Royal Style Design, Inc. (collectively, the "Company") as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficiency) and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization Royal Style Design, Inc. (the “Company” or “Royal Style Design”) was incorporated in the State of Florida in July, 2006. Royal Style Design specializes in customized solutions and installations in stone and tile in customized design homes in Central Florida. Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements of the Company are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples include estimates of costs to complete performance contracts, income tax exposures and valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the guidance contained in SEC Staff Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB No. 104"). Revenue is recognized as each stage is completed, based upon a percentage of the projected costs. There are no customer acceptance provisions in our sales contracts. The majority of the Company’s revenue has been received from developers. Receivables Receivables are recorded when invoices are issued and are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Receivables are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company’s historical losses, the existing economic conditions in the construction industry and the financial ability of its customers. The Company believes that no allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Cost of Sales Included in cost of sales are subcontractors, payroll, payroll taxes, workman compensation insurance and materials. General and Administrative Expenses Included in general and administrative expenses are payroll, automobile expenses, insurance, telephone, professional fees, office expenses and other minor miscellaneous expenses. F-7 Depreciation Property and equipment is carried at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. For income tax purposes, depreciation is recorded using accelerated methods of cost recovery over statutory recovery periods. Depreciable Asset Lives Vehicles 5 years Office equipment 5 years Income Taxes Prior to January 1, 2007, the Company was an “S” Corporation, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service Code Section and, accordingly, any income or losses would flow directly to the stockholders. The undistributed earnings of the S Corporation prior to January 1, 2007 have been reclassified to additional paid in capital. The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach under which deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted tax rates applicable to future years to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of reported assets and liabilities. The principal items giving rise to deferred taxes are the use of accelerated depreciation methods for machinery and equipment and the carry forward of net operating losses. Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with guidance in SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." If the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the present value of the related estimated future cash flows, the asset would be adjusted to its fair value and an impairment loss would be charged to operations in the period identified. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are concentrated primarily in one bank in the United States. At times, such deposits could be in excess of insured limits. Management believes that the financial institution that holds the Company financial instrument is financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk is believed to exist with respect to these financial instruments. The Company grants credit to customers based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition, without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer’s financial condition. The Company controls its exposure to credit risk due to normally dealing with the same contractors and receiving payment for materials prior to completion of the services. Earnings Per Share Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the specified period. Diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares during the specified period. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no potential shares outstanding. F-8 New Financial Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”, which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities using fair value. This Standard provides a single definition of fair value, together with a framework for measuring it, and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS 157-1, “Application of SFAS No. 157 to SFAS No. 13 and Its Related Interpretative Accounting Pronouncements that Address Leasing Transactions” (“FSP SFAS 157-1”) and FASB Staff Position SFAS 157-2, “Effective Date of SFAS No. 157” (“FSP SFAS 157-2”). FSP SFAS 157-1 excludes SFAS No. 13 and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions from the requirements of SFAS No. 157, with the exception of fair value measurements of assets and liabilities recorded as a result of a lease transaction but measured pursuant to other pronouncements within the scope of SFAS No. 157. FSP SFAS 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). FSP SFAS 157-1 and FSP SFAS 157-2 became effective for the Company upon adoption of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008. The Company will provide the additional disclosures required relating to the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities when it completes its implementation of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2009, as required, and does not believe they will have a significant impact on its financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 (“SFAS 159”) “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The Standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. It also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the Company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159 did not have a material impact on its financial statements. In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07-3, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities," which is effective for calendar year companies on January 1, 2008. The Task Force concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided. EITF Issue No. 07-3 did not impact the Company’s financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R), which replaces SFAS 141 “Business Combinations”. This Statement is intended to improve the relevance, completeness and representational faithfulness of the information provided in financial reports about the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination. This Statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the Statement. Under SFAS 141(R), acquisition-related costs, including restructuring costs, must be recognized separately from the acquisition and will generally be expensed as incurred. That replaces SFAS 141’s cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. SFAS 141(R) shall be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual report period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 141(R) on January 1, 2009, as required, and does not believe it will have a material impact on its financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SFAS No. 162”). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. This Statement is effective sixty days following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 162 on its financial statements.

F-10 4. COMMON STOCK The Articles of Incorporation of the Company as originally filed on July 7, 2006 provided for authorized capital stock of 100 shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share. On July 10, 2006, the Company issued one share of common stock to each of the three founding stockholders. Effective September 2008, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized common stock to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share; to authorize a new class of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share; and to change each of the three outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share, into 1,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share. All share and per share information have been revised to give retroactive effect to the stock split. On October 9, 2008, the Company issued 500,000 shares of common stock valued at $20,000 (the fair value of the consideration received) to Alexander Sorokoumov, the father of Ivan Sorokoumov, Chief Financial Officer, for consulting services to be performed in the area of business growth and development. The term for the consulting services is for a period of one year, and the expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $4,603. On October 9, 2008, the Company issued 500,000 shares of common stock valued at $20,000 (the fair value of the consideration received) to each Nikolaj Uraev and Iossif Yenikeyev for consulting services to be performed in the area of business growth and development. The term for the consulting services is for a period of one year, and the expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $9,025. 5. INCOME TAXES The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”, (“FIN 48”) on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no adjustment in the net liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. The reconciliation of the effective income tax rate to the federal statutory rate is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Benefits computed at the $ (14,706 ) $ (1,022 ) statutory rate State and local income taxes, net of - - federal benefit Effect of unused operating losses 14,706 1,022 $ - $ - At December 31, 2008, the Company has a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $45,000 which expires in various years though 2020. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of the net operating loss carry forwards. In recognition of the uncertainty regarding the ultimate amount of tax benefits to be derived from the Company’s net operating loss carry forwards, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the entire amount of the deferred asset. 6. Major Customers The Company had sales in excess of ten percent of sales to three customers in 2008 and four customers in 2007. The amount and percentages of the company sales to these customers in each year were $123,324 (28%), $82,209 (19%) and $67,995 (16%) in 2008 and $115,655 (21%), $109,408 (20%), $96,044 (17%) and $82,509 (15%) in 2007. Management believes that the loss of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company result of operation, financial position and cash flow. F-11 7. Commitments and Contingencies The Company conducts its operations from a leased property in Florida. The lease requires the Company to pay certain executive costs (such as insurance and maintenance). Future minimum lease payments for operating leases are approximately as follows: Years Ending December 31, Amount 2009 $ 5,520 2010 5,520 $ 11,040 Total rent expense was approximately $5,520 and $3,819 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers As provided by Chapter 607(Corporations), Section 850, of the Florida Statutes, we have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party to any proceeding (other than an action by, or in the right of, the corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against liability incurred in connection with such proceeding, including any appeal thereof, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. The Company has the power to indemnify any person, who was or is a party to any proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against expenses and amounts paid in settlement not exceeding, in the judgment of the board of directors, the estimated expense of litigating the proceeding to conclusion, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such proceeding, including any appeal thereof. Such indemnification shall be authorized if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company, except that no indemnification shall be made under this subsection in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable unless, and only to the extent that, the court in which such proceeding was brought, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper. II-1 To the extent that a director, officer, employee, or agent of a Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding referred to in the two preceding paragraphs, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the Florida corporations law provides that he or she shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith. The Company has the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify the person against such liability under the provisions discussed above. Our Articles of Incorporation provide in Article VIII that no director of the Company shall be personally liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except (a) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 607.0834 of the Florida Business Corporation Act (“FBCA”), or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the FCBA is hereafter amended to permit a corporation to further eliminate or limit the liability of a director of a corporation, then the liability of a director of the Company, in addition to the circumstances in which a director is not personally liable as set forth in the preceding sentence, shall, without further action of the directors or stockholders, be further eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the FBCA as so amended. Our Articles of Incorporation further provide in Article IX that our directors, officers, employees or agents shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against all judgments, penalties and fines incurred or paid, and against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) and settlement amounts incurred or paid, in connection with any specified proceedings, except in relation to matters as to which the person did not act in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was unlawful. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article Seventh shall include the right with certain conditions to require the Company to pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition.

(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.
