It does not contain all the information you should consider before investing in our common shares. Important information is incorporated by reference into this prospectus. To understand this offering fully, you should read carefully the entire prospectus, including Risk Factors, together with the additional information described under Incorporation by Reference. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references in this prospectus to the Company, we, us and our refer to Ultra Petroleum Corp. and its subsidiaries. Our Company We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, production, operation, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. Our operations are primarily focused on developing our natural gas reserves in the Green River Basin of southwest Wyoming, oil reserves in the Uinta Basin in northeast Utah and natural gas reserves in the Appalachian Basin in north-central Pennsylvania. Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization On April 29, 2016, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Keystone Gas Gathering, LLC, Ultra Resources, Inc., Ultra Wyoming, Inc., Ultra Wyoming LGS, LLC, UP Energy Corporation, UPL Pinedale, LLC, and UPL Three Rivers Holdings, LLC, filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court). On March 14, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Order Confirming Debtors Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the Confirmation Order), which approved and confirmed the Debtors Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) as modified by the Confirmation Order. On April 12, 2017 (the Effective Date), we satisfied the conditions to effectiveness set forth in the Confirmation Order and in the Plan, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and we emerged from bankruptcy. For more information on the events that occurred and the common shares issued in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, see our Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on April 18, 2017. Corporate Information Our principal executive offices are located at 400 North Sam Houston Parkway East, Suite 1200, Houston, Texas 77060, and our telephone number at that address is (281) 876-0120. Our common shares are listed on NASDAQ under the symbol UPL. Information contained on our website, www.ultrapetroleum.com, does not constitute a part of this prospectus. 1 Table of Contents The Offering Issuer: Ultra Petroleum Corp., a Yukon, Canada corporation. Common shares to be offered by the selling shareholders: 63,544,297 common shares. Common shares outstanding(1): 197,099,764 common shares (including 2,108,108 restricted stock units that are expected to convert into common shares on a one-for-one basis). Use of proceeds: We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common shares by the selling shareholders. NASDAQ ticker symbol: UPL. Risk factors: Investing in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. See Risk Factors and the risk factors set forth in the documents incorporated by reference herein for a discussion of factors you should carefully consider before deciding to invest in our common shares. (1) The number of common shares to be outstanding is based on the number of common shares outstanding as of April 20, 2017. 2 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS An investment in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this prospectus, you should carefully consider each of the risk factors set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as other information we include or incorporate by reference in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement. Any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If that occurs, the trading price of our common shares could decline materially and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks included in this prospectus and the documents we have incorporated by reference into this prospectus are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that result from developments occurring in the future. Conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Past financial and operational performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Risks Related to Our Emergence from Bankruptcy Our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby. In connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections. We recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships. It is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from bankruptcy could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, employees and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including risks that key suppliers could terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us or enhanced performance by us or that competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future. The ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy. The success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity. 3 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The information in this prospectus includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

We urge you to carefully consider these factors and the other cautionary statements in this prospectus. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 5 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS The common shares to be offered and sold using this prospectus will be offered and sold by the selling shareholders named in this prospectus. See Selling Shareholders. Accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common shares in this offering. 6 Table of Contents MARKET PRICE OF COMMON SHARES In connection with our reorganization and emergence from bankruptcy, all of our outstanding pre-emergence common shares and all other equity interests in the Company were cancelled. On April 13, 2017, our new common shares began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol UPL. Prior to such time, there was no established public trading market for our new common shares. As of April 25, 2017, the last reported sales price of our common shares as reported on NASDAQ was $10.97 per share and there were approximately 573 holders of record of common shares based on the information provided by our transfer agent. 7 Table of Contents DIVIDEND POLICY The Company does not anticipate paying any dividends on the common shares in the foreseeable future. Our debt documents currently prohibit us from paying dividends on our common shares. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt instruments to which we may be a party may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of common shares. 8 Table of Contents SELLING SHAREHOLDERS This prospectus covers the offering for resale of up to an aggregate of 63,544,297 common shares that may be offered and sold from time to time under this prospectus by the selling shareholders identified below, subject to any appropriate adjustment as a result of any stock dividend, stock split or distribution, or in connection with a combination of shares, and any security into which such common shares shall have been converted or exchanged in connection with a recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, exchange, distribution or otherwise. The selling shareholders acquired the common shares in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy on April 12, 2017. On April 12, 2017, we entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with certain shareholders pursuant to which we were obligated to prepare and file a registration statement to permit the resale of certain common shares held by the selling shareholders from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act. All information with respect to the selling shareholders ownership of the common shares has been furnished by or on behalf of the selling shareholders and is as of April 20, 2017. We have not sought to verify such information. We believe, based on information supplied by the selling shareholders, that except as may otherwise be indicated in the footnotes to the table below, the selling shareholders have sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the common shares reported as beneficially owned by them. Because the selling shareholders identified in the table may sell some or all of the common shares owned by them which are included in this prospectus, and because there are currently no agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale of any of the common shares, no estimate can be given as to the number of common shares available for resale hereby that will be held by the selling shareholders upon termination of this offering. In addition, the selling shareholders may have sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, at any time and from time to time, the common shares they hold in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act after the date on which the selling shareholders provided the information set forth on the table below. We have, therefore, assumed for the purposes of the following table, that the selling shareholders will sell all of the common shares beneficially owned by them that are covered by this prospectus. The selling shareholders are not obligated to sell any of the common shares offered by this prospectus.

A resolution passed at a shareholder meeting by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders who voted in respect of such a resolution is required to appoint and to remove a director. The vote of the two additional directors selected in accordance with the Plan prior to the Effective Date will be required to approve any Material M&A Transaction (as defined in the Articles) during the two-year period beginning on the Effective Date. Dividends. Subject to the prior rights of the holders of any series of preferred shares that we may issue in the future and any other shares ranking senior to the common shares with respect to priority in the payment of dividends, the holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends, as and when declared by our board of directors (the Board) out of moneys properly applicable to the payment of dividends, in such amount and in such form as the Board may from time to time determine. Any dividends declared shall be paid in equal amounts per share on all common shares outstanding. Our loan documents currently prohibit us from paying dividends on our common shares. Liquidation. In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of our affairs, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of our assets among our shareholders for the purpose of winding-up our affairs, subject to the prior rights of the holders of any series of preferred shares that we may issue in the future and any other claims or shares ranking senior to common shares with respect to priority in the distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or distribution for the purpose of winding-up, the holders of common shares are entitled to receive our remaining property and assets of the Company. Fully Paid. All of our outstanding common shares are fully paid and non-assessable. Other Rights. Holders of common shares have no redemption or conversion rights, preemptive or other rights to subscribe for our securities and are not entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. 12 Table of Contents Preferred Shares The Board is empowered to (i) authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 preferred shares without nominal or par value and (ii) determine, subject to the limitations in the Articles, the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions thereof, including the rate or rates, dividend rights, whether cumulative or non-cumulative or partially cumulative, the priorities, purchase for cancellation, retraction or redemption rights, the conversion rights, exchange rights, voting rights and the terms of any share purchase plan or sinking fund with respect thereto. The issuance of preferred shares may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common shares. At present, the Company has no plans to issue any preferred shares. Anti-Takeover Provisions There are provisions of our organizational documents or Yukon law that may hinder or impede take-over bids. Board of Directors. The Board shall consist of not less than one and not more than seven directors. As of the date of filing the Articles, the Board was comprised of seven directors (the Initial Slate). Pursuant and subject to the Articles, the directors may, between annual general meetings, appoint one or more additional directors, provided that the number of additional directors does not exceed one third of the number of directors who held office at the expiration of the last annual general meeting and that the total number of directors does not exceed the maximum number of directors fixed under the Articles. Pursuant to the Articles and the Plan, the initial term for the Initial Slate shall be the longer of two years from the Effective Date, or until the election of their successor. At each annual meeting of shareholders that occurs after April 12, 2019, directors will be elected for a term of office to expire on the close of the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. As described above in Common SharesVoting Rights, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders at a meeting is required to remove a director. Preferred Shares. The Articles authorize the issuance of preferred stock. As described above under Preferred Shares, the Board may, without shareholder approval, issue preferred shares with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common shares that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common shares. Yukon Anti-Takeover Statutes. Under the Business Corporations Act, certain business combinations, including a merger, reorganization or the sale, lease, or other disposition of all or a substantial part of our assets, must be approved by a resolution passed by at least two-thirds of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote, and in limited circumstances, by each class or series of shares regardless of whether such shares have the right to vote. In some cases, it may be advantageous for an arrangement (which may include a business combination) to be approved by a Yukon court. Shareholders may also have a right to dissent from certain transactions, in which case, we may be required to pay dissenting shareholders the fair value of their shares provided they have followed the required procedures. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common shares is Computershare Investor Services, Inc. 13 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION As of the date of this prospectus, we have not been advised by the selling shareholders as to any plan of distribution. The selling shareholders, or their pledgees, donees (including charitable organizations), transferees or other successors-in-interest, may from time to time, sell any or all of the common shares offered by this prospectus either directly by such individual, or through underwriters, dealers or agents or on any exchange on which the common shares may from time to time be traded, in the over-the-counter market, or in independently negotiated transactions or otherwise. The selling stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling our common shares:  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the common shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  any exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which the prospectus will form a part;  broker-dealers may agree with the selling shareholders to sell a specified number of such common shares at a stipulated price per share;  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  a combination of any such methods of sale; or  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling shareholders may also sell common shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, or otherwise as permitted pursuant to applicable law, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling shareholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of the common shares under this prospectus, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to the prospectus, in the case of any agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Rule 2121 (Rule 2121), and, in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with Rule 2121. In connection with sales of the common shares under this prospectus or interests therein, the selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling shareholders may also sell the common shares short and deliver them to close their short positions, or loan or pledge the common shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell them. The selling shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of common shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the selling shareholders have been advised that they may not use the common shares registered on the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part to cover short sales of the common shares made prior to the date the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC. 14 Table of Contents The selling shareholders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the common shares owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell common shares from time to time under this prospectus, or under an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act, amending, if necessary, the list of selling shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling shareholders under this prospectus. The selling shareholders may also transfer and donate the common shares in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. The selling shareholders and any underwriters, dealers or agents that participate in distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any profit on sale of the securities by them and any discounts, commissions or concessions received by any underwriter, dealer or agent may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. There can be no assurances that the selling shareholders will sell any or all of the securities offered under this prospectus. 15 Table of Contents LEGAL MATTERS The validity of our common shares offered hereby will be passed upon for us by Lackowicz & Hoffman, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada. 16 Table of Contents EXPERTS The consolidated financial statements of Ultra Petroleum Corp appearing in Ultra Petroleum Corps Annual Report (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the effectiveness of Ultra Petroleum Corps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their reports thereon (such report on the consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph describing conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements), and incorporated herein by reference.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Business Corporations Act, Section 126, enables a corporation to indemnify a director or officer or a former director or officer of the corporation, or a person who acts or acted at the corporations request as a director or officer of a body corporate or in a similar capacity in respect of an unincorporated organization, and their heirs and legal representatives (collectively, a Person), against all costs, charges and expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or to satisfy a judgment reasonably incurred by them in any civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other proceeding, whether current, threatened, pending or completed, in which the person is involved because of such persons association with the corporation as described above if: (a) the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the corporation, or, as the case may be, of the body corporate or unincorporated organization for which the person acted; and (b) in the case of a criminal or administrative action or proceeding that is enforced by a monetary penalty, the person had reasonable grounds for believing that their conduct was lawful. Furthermore, the Business Corporations Act provides that a Person is entitled to indemnity from the corporation in respect of all costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with the defense of any civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other proceeding to which the person is subject because of their association with the corporation as described in the paragraph above if the Person seeking indemnification: (a) was not judged by the Supreme Court (as defined in the Business Corporations Act) or other competent authority to have committed any fault nor to have omitted to do anything that the person ought to have done; and (b) fulfills the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. The Business Corporations Act also provides that a corporation may purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of a Person against liability incurred by them: (a) in their capacity as a director or officer of the corporation; or (b) in their capacity as a director or officer of another body corporate, or in a similar capacity in respect of an unincorporated organization, if they act or acted in that capacity at the corporations request. 20 Table of Contents Our bylaws provide for indemnification of our officers and directors, and the advancement to them of expenses in connection with proceedings and claims, as permitted under the Business Corporations Act. Our bylaws also provide that subject to the limitations contained in the Business Corporations Act, we may purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of our directors and officers as our Board may from time to time determine. We have purchased liability insurance for our directors and officers which insures, among other things: (a) our officers and directors from any claim arising out of an alleged wrongful act by such persons while acting as directors, officers or controlling persons; and (b) us, to the extent we have indemnified the directors and officers for such loss. The Company also maintains directors and officers liability insurance. Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.

Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. (a) Exhibits. See the Exhibit Index immediately following the signature page hereto, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. 21 Table of Contents (b) Financial Statement Schedules. None. Item 17. Undertakings. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (a) to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in this registration statement or any material change to such information in this registration statement; (b) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; (c) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering; (d) that, for purposes of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: (i) If the registrant is relying on Rule 430C if the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness; provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (e) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (f) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof 22 Table of Contents Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 23 Table of Contents SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Houston, State of Texas on April 26, 2017.
