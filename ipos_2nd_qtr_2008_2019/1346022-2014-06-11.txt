This Prospectus, and any supplement to this Prospectus include forward-looking statements. To the extent that the information presented in this Prospectus discusses financial projections, information or expectations about our business plans, results of operations, products or markets, or otherwise makes statements about future events, such statements are forward-looking.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. These include, among others, the cautionary statements in the Risk Factors section beginning on page 9 of this Prospectus and the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations section elsewhere in this Prospectus.

Corporate Background Enertopia Corp. was formed on November 24, 2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada and commenced operations on November 24, 2004. From inception until April 2008, we were primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. Beginning in April 2008, we began our entry into the clean energy sector by purchasing an interest in a solar thermal design and installation company. In late summer 2013, we began our entry into medicinal marijuana business. Our company is diverse in its pursuit of business opportunities in several sectors, including: Medicinal Marijuana, Oil and Gas, Solar PV (Photovoltaic), Solar Thermal (Hot Water), Energy Retrofits and Recovery, and Solar powered Filtered Drinking Water. The address of our principal executive office is Suite 950, 1130 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6E 4A4. Our telephone number is (604) 602-1675. In addition, we have a second office located in Kelowna, British Columbia. Our current locations provide adequate office space for our purposes at this stage of our development. On September 28, 2012, our company closed an offering memorandum placement of 995,000 units at a price of CAD$0.05 per unit for gross proceeds of CAD$49,750 or $49,750. Each Unit consisted of one common share of the Issuer and one common share purchase warrant. One warrant will be exercisable into one further common share at a price of $0.15 per warrant share for a period of twelve months following closing; or at a price of $0.20 per warrant for the period that is twelve months plus one day to twenty-four months following closing. Our company issued 79,500 shares, 79,500 warrants and 79,500 broker warrants in connection with the private placement. On October 24, 2012, our company issued 100,000 common shares in connection with Altar Resources, Mildred Peak property for an amount of $6,000 at a price of $0.06. On November 15, 2012, our company closed an offering memorandum placement of 1,013,000 units at a price of CAD$0.05 per unit for gross proceeds of CAD$50,650 or $50,650. Each Unit consisted of one common share of the Issuer and one common share purchase warrant. One warrant will be exercisable into one further common share at a price of $0.10 per warrant share for a period of twelve months following closing; or at a price of $0.20 per warrant for the period that is twelve months plus one day to twenty-four months following closing. Our company issued 38,000 common shares, 101,300 units, and 101,300 broker warrants in connection with the private placement. 6 On March 1, 2013, our company settled the debt incurred of $16,000 from September 1, 2011 to February 28, 2013 for consulting fees with Mr. Mark Snyder by issuing 160,000 restricted common shares of our company at a price of $0.10 per share. On May 30, 2013, our company terminated its Option Agreement with Altar Resources with respect to the Mildred Peak property. On June 26, 2013, our company terminated its Option Agreement with Wildhorse Copper Inc. with respect to the Copper Hills property. Subsequent to year end, on September 17, 2013 our company entered into an AMI Participation Agreement with Downhole Energy LLC to participate in 100% gross interest and 75% net revenue interest for drilling, completion and production of up to 100 oil wells on certain oil and gas leases covering 2,924 in the historic field located in Forest and Venango counties, Pennsylvania. On execution of this agreement our company issued 100,000 of its common shares to Downhole Energy LLC. Subsequent to year end, on October 4, 2013 our company entered into a consulting agreement with Olibri Acquisitions and issued 750,000 common shares of our company. Subsequent to year end, our company has entered into a Letter of Intent Agreement ( LOI ) on November 1, 2013 with 0786521 BC Ltd. (the  Vendor ) where our company wishes to buy and the Vendor wishes to sell 51% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Vendor. The Vendor is the owner, operator of a Medical Marihuana operation located at 33420 Cardinal Street, Mission, British Columbia, Canada. Until such time as the Vendor and our company enter into a Definitive Agreement, the Parties agree that all terms of this LOI are and shall serve only as an expression of interest between the Vendor and our company. This LOI is not comprehensive and no business relationship is created between the Vendor and our company unless and until such time as negotiations between the Parties result in the consummation of a Definitive Agreement and such Definitive Agreement is ratified by their respective authorized representatives. On the execution of the LOI, our company issued 10,000,000 of its common shares to the Vendor. Subsequent to year end, on November 18, 2013, our company entered into an investor relations contract with Coal Harbour Communications Inc. The initial term of this agreement shall begin on the date of execution of this Agreement and continue for two months. Thereafter the agreement will continue on a month-by-month basis pending cancelation by written notification with 30 days of notice. In consideration for the services our company will pay the Provider a one-time payment of two hundred thousand shares (200,000) of restricted common stock in Enertopia Corporation. Subsequent to year end, on November 26, 2013, our company closed the first tranche of a private placement of 2,720,000 units at a price of CAD$0.05 per unit for gross proceeds of CAD$136,000 ($136,000). Each warrant will be exercisable into one further share at a price of $0.10 per warrant share for a period of thirty six month following the close.

Our renewable energy business and Medical Marihuana ( MMJ ) operations are in the start-up stage only, and are unproven. We may not be successful in implementing our business plan to become profitable. There may be less demand for our services than we anticipate. There is no assurance that this business will succeed. Changing consumer preferences. The decision of a potential client to undergo an environmental audit or review may be based on ethical or commercial reasons. In some instances, or with certain businesses, there may be no assurance that an environmental review will result in any cost savings or increased revenues. As such, unless the ethical consideration is also a material factor, there may be no incentive for such businesses to undertake an environmental review. Changes in consumer and commercial preferences, or trends, toward or away from environmental issues may impact on businesses decisions to undergo environmental reviews. MMJ sector offers many choices for MMJ patients and their can be no assurance that the product supplied by the Company and or its partners will be successful in market penetration. General economic factors. The willingness of businesses to spend time and money on energy efficiency may be dependent upon general economic conditions; and any material downturn may reduce the likelihood of businesses incurring costs toward what some businesses may consider a discretionary expense item. Willingness by MMJ patients to continue to buy MMJ products may be dependant upon general economic conditions and any material downturn may reduce the potential profitability of the MMJ business sector. Factors affecting operating results. Our operating results will be affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially affect revenues and profitability, including the timing and cancellation of customer orders and projects, competitive pressures on pricing, availability of personnel, and market acceptance of our services. As a result, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly and annual basis which could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Competition. There are virtually no barriers to entry in the solar PV, solar thermal and energy recovery business sectors. As it is largely unregulated, we may face growing competition from any number of persons or firms who are, or who hold themselves out to be, competitors in this field. Quality of service/industry practices. Demand for our services may be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the quality of our services or the industrys practices. Adverse publicity may discourage businesses from buying our services and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Unethical business practices. 10 We may suffer negative publicity if we, any third party contractors we may engage, or any of our customers for whom we have implemented changes, are found to engage in any environmentally insensitive practices or other business practices that are viewed as unethical. No significant customers. We currently have no long-term agreements with any customers. Many of our services may be provided on a onetime basis. Accordingly, we will require new customers on a continuous basis to sustain our operations. Fixed price contracts. Fixed price contracts require the service provider to perform all agreed services for a specified lump-sum amount. We anticipate a material percentage of our services will be performed on a fixed price basis. Fixed price contracts expose us to some significant risks, including under-estimation of costs, ambiguities in specifications, unforeseen costs or difficulties, and delays beyond our control. These risks could lead to losses on contracts which may be substantial and which could adversely affect the results of our operations. Effectiveness and efficiency of advertising and promotional expenditures. The future growth and profitability of our clean energy business and MMJ sectors will be dependent in part on the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and promotional expenditures, including our ability to (i) create greater awareness of our services, (ii) determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for future advertising expenditures, and (iii) effectively manage advertising and promotional costs in order to maintain acceptable operating margins. There can be no assurance that we will experience benefits from advertising and promotional expenditures in the future. In addition, no assurance can be given that our planned advertising and promotional expenditures will result in increased revenues, will generate levels of service and name awareness or that we will be able to manage such advertising and promotional expenditures on a cost-effective basis. Human resources. We will depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate our management team, consultants and other employees. There is strong competition for qualified technical and management personnel in the renewable energy sector, and it is expected that such competition will increase. Our planned growth will place increased demands on our existing resources and will likely require the addition of technical personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel. There can be no assurance that our compensation packages will be sufficient to ensure the continued availability of qualified personnel who are necessary for the development of our business. We have a limited operating history with losses and we expect the losses to continue, which raises concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have generated minimal revenues since our inception and will, in all likelihood, continue to incur operating expenses with minimal revenues until we are able to successfully develop our business. Our business plan will require us to incur further expenses. We may not be able to ever become profitable. These circumstances raise concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have a limited operating history and must be considered in the start-up stage. There is an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued in connection with the financial statements for the three and six months ended February 28, 2014 with respect to their doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to our financial statements for the three and six months ended February 28, 2014, we have incurred a net loss of $472,213 for the six months ended February 28, 2014 (net loss $191,108 for the six months ended February 28, 2013) and as at February 28, 2014 has incurred cumulative losses of $6,596,871 that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Our management has been able, thus far, to finance the operations through equity financing and cash on hand. There is no assurance that our company will be able to continue to finance our company on this basis 11 We will require additional financing to develop our business plan. Because we have generated only minimal revenue from our business and cannot anticipate when we will be able to generate meaningful revenue from our business, we will need to raise additional funds to conduct and grow our business. We do not currently have sufficient financial resources to completely fund the development of our business plan. We anticipate that we will need to raise further financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and we can provide no assurance to investors that we will be able to find such financing if required. The most likely source of future funds presently available to us is through the sale of equity capital. Any sale of share capital will result in dilution to existing security-holders. We may not be able to obtain all of the licenses necessary to operate our business. Our operations may require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities to build and install alternative energy systems or to conduct energy retrofits and build MMJ operations. We believe that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits under applicable laws and regulations for our operations and believe we will be able to comply in all material respects with the terms of such licenses and permits. However, such licenses and permits are subject to change in various circumstances. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary licenses and permits. Changes in environmental regulations. We believe that we currently comply with existing environmental laws and regulations affecting our proposed operations. While there are no currently known proposed changes in these laws or regulations, significant changes have affected the industry in the past and additional changes may occur in the future. Our operations may be subject to environmental laws, regulations and rules promulgated from time to time by government. In addition, certain types of operations require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that means stricter standards and enforcement. Fines and penalties for non-compliance are more stringent. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies, directors, officers and employees. The cost of compliance with changes in governmental regulations has potential to reduce the profitability of operations. We intend to comply with all environmental regulations in the United States and Canada. If we are unable to recruit or retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price. Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our executive officers and third party relationships. We currently do not have key person insurance on these individuals. The loss of these people, especially without advance notice, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our stock price. It is also very important that we be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including technical personnel, to accommodate our exploration plans and to replace personnel who leave. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these conditions, we could be unable to recruit, train, and retain employees. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price. If we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business results could be harmed and our managerial and operational resources may be strained. 12 As we proceed with our business plan, we expect to experience significant and rapid growth in the scope and complexity of our business. We will need to add staff to market our services, manage operations, handle sales and marketing efforts and perform finance and accounting functions. We will be required to hire a broad range of additional personnel in order to successfully advance our operations. This growth is likely to place a strain on our management and operational resources. The failure to develop and implement effective systems, or to hire and retain sufficient personnel for the performance of all of the functions necessary to effectively service and manage our potential business, or the failure to manage growth effectively, could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Risks Associated with the Shares of Our Company Because we do not intend to pay any dividends on our shares, investors seeking dividend income or liquidity should not purchase our shares. We have not declared or paid any dividends on our shares since inception, and do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future. We presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future, it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors. We presently intend to retain all earnings to implement our business plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future. Investors seeking dividend income or liquidity should not invest in our shares. Because we can issue additional shares, purchasers of our shares may incur immediate dilution and may experience further dilution. We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares. The board of directors of our company have the authority to cause us to issue additional shares, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, our stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our company in the future. Other Risks Trading on the OTCBB and CSE may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCBB service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCBB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCBB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCBB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like Nasdaq or a stock exchange like Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of the shares. Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the Securities and Exchange Commissions penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock. Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. 13 The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock. In addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. We believe that our operations comply, in all material respects, with all applicable environmental regulations. Our operating partners maintain insurance coverage customary to the industry; however, we are not fully insured against all possible environmental risks. Any change to government regulation/administrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability. The laws, regulations, policies or current administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States, Canada, or any other jurisdiction, may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business. The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest groups, may have a detrimental effect on us. Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and/or our profitably. Because we can issue additional shares, purchasers of our shares may incur immediate dilution and may experience further dilution. We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares. The board of directors of our company has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, our stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our company in the future. 14 Our by-laws contain provisions indemnifying our officers and directors against all costs, charges and expenses incurred by them. Our by-laws contain provisions with respect to the indemnification of our officers and directors against all costs, charges and expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment, actually and reasonably incurred by him, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment in a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding to which he is made a party by reason of his being or having been one of our directors or officers. Investors interests in our company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share if we issue additional shares or raise funds through the sale of equity securities. Our constating documents authorize the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. In the event that we are required to issue any additional shares or enter into private placements to raise financing through the sale of equity securities, investors interests in our company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuances also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change in our control. Our by-laws do not contain anti-takeover provisions, which could result in a change of our management and directors if there is a take-over of our company. We do not currently have a shareholder rights plan or any anti-takeover provisions in our By-laws. Without any anti-takeover provisions, there is no deterrent for a take-over of our company, which may result in a change in our management and directors. As a result of a majority of our directors and officers are residents of other countries other than the United States, investors may find it difficult to enforce, within the United States, any judgments obtained against our company or our directors and officers. Other than our operations offices in Vancouver and Kelowna, British Columbia, we do not currently maintain a permanent place of business within the United States. In addition, a majority of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such persons assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against our company or our officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. Trends, risks and uncertainties. We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common shares.

Item 6  Dilution 22,990,500 common shares of the 33,393,800 shares of our common stock to be sold by the Selling Security Holders are currently issued and outstanding, and will therefore not cause dilution to any of our existing stockholders.

The numbers in this table assume that none of the Selling Security Holders will sell shares not being offered in this Prospectus or will purchase additional shares, and assumes that all the shares being registered will be sold. None of the Selling Security Holders has had a material relationship with us other than as a security holder at any time within the past three years, or has ever been one of our officers or directors or an officer or director of our predecessors or affiliates. None of the Selling Security Holders are broker-dealers or affiliates of a broker-dealer. 28 Item 8  Plan of Distribution We are registering an aggregate of 33,393,800 common shares of our company, consisting of 22,990,500 previously issued common shares of our company and 10,403,300 shares of common stock underlying previously issued warrants by our company by Selling Shareholders. The Selling Security Holders have the option to sell the 33,393,800 shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. The shares may be sold in a lawful manner using any one or more of the following methods: private transaction; ordinary brokerage transactions; transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; broker-dealer as principal purchasers and resale by the broker-dealer for its own account; block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as an agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; broker-dealer agreements with the selling shareholder to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; exchange distribution following the rules of the applicable exchange; short sales that are not violations of the laws and regulations of any state of the United States; through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; or through a combination of any such methods or other lawful means. The Selling Security Holders are underwriters, within the meaning of section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. Any broker-dealers or agents that participate in the sale of the common stock or interests therein may also be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. Any discounts, commissions, concessions or profit earned on any resale of the shares may be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. The Selling Security Holders, who are underwriters within the meaning of section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, are subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. The brokers or dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Security Holders, if any of the broker-dealer acts as an agent for the purchaser of said shares, from the purchaser in the amount to be negotiated which are not expected to exceed those customary in the types of transactions involved. Broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Security Holders to sell a specified number of the shares of common stock at a stipulated price per share. In connection with such re-sales, the broker-dealer may pay to or receive from the purchasers of the shares, commissions as described above. Any broker or dealer participating in any distribution of the shares may be required to deliver a copy of this Prospectus, including any prospectus supplement, to any individual who purchases any shares from or through such broker-dealer. We have our common stock quoted on the OTCQB and CSE. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTCQB and CSE is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with a companys operations or business prospects. The OTCQB should not be confused with the NASDAQ market. OTCQB companies are subject to far less restrictions and regulations than companies whose securities are traded on the NASDAQ market. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and the trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like the NASDAQ Small Cap or a stock exchange. In the absence of an active trading market investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations for our common stock and its market visibility may be limited, which may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. We are bearing all costs relating to the registration of our common stock. The Selling Security Holders, however, will pay any commissions or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the shares of our common stock. The Selling Security Holders must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in the offer and sale of our common stock. In particular, during such times as the Selling Security Holders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of any securities, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable laws and may, among other things: 29 furnish each broker or dealer through which our common stock may be offered such copies of this Prospectus, as amended from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer; not engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our securities; and not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities other than as permitted under the Exchange Act. Regulation M During such time as the Selling Security Holders may be engaged in a distribution of any of the securities being registered by this Prospectus, the Selling Security Holders are required to comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. In general, Regulation M precludes any selling security holder, any affiliated purchaser and any broker-dealer or other person who participates in a distribution from bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase, any security that is the subject of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete. Regulation M defines a distribution as an offering of securities that is distinguished from ordinary trading activities by the magnitude of the offering and the presence of special selling efforts and selling methods. Regulation M also defines a distribution participant as an underwriter, prospective underwriter, broker, dealer, or other person who has agreed to participate or who is participating in a distribution. Regulation M prohibits, with certain exceptions, participants in a distribution from bidding for or purchasing, for an account in which the participant has a beneficial interest, any of the securities that are the subject of the distribution. Regulation M also governs bids and purchases made in order to stabilize the price of a security in connection with a distribution of the security. We have informed the Selling Security Holders that the anti-manipulation provisions of Regulation M may apply to the sales of their shares offered by this Prospectus, and we have also advised the Selling Security Holders of the requirements for delivery of this Prospectus in connection with any sales of the shares offered by this Prospectus. With regard to short sales, the Selling Security Holders cannot cover their short sales with securities from this offering. In addition, if a short sale is deemed to be a stabilizing activity, then the Selling Security Holders will not be permitted to engage in such an activity. All of these limitations may affect the marketability of our common stock. The Selling Security Holders may also elect to sell their common shares in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, rather than pursuant to this Prospectus. After the sale of the shares offered by this Prospectus the Selling Security Holders will have 10,403,300 common shares. The sale of these shares could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares or on any trading market that is developed. We have not registered or qualified offers and sales of shares of common stock under the laws of any country, other than the United States. To comply with certain states securities laws, if applicable, the Selling Security Holders will offer and sell their shares of common stock in such jurisdictions only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in certain states the Selling Security Holders may not offer or sell shares of common stock unless we have registered or qualified such shares for sale in such states or we have complied with an available exemption from registration or qualification. All expenses of this registration statement, estimated to be approximately $17,500, including but not limited to legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees will, be paid by our company. However, any selling costs or brokerage commissions incurred by each Selling Security Holder relating to the sale of their shares will be paid by them. See Use of Proceeds on page 16. Penny Stock Rules 30 The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which: contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to violations of such duties or other requirements of federal securities laws; contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask prices; contains the toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and contains such other information, and is in such form (including language, type size, and format) as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. Prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, a broker-dealer must also provide a customer with: the bid and ask prices for the penny stock; the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; the amount and a description of any compensation that the broker-dealer and its associated salesperson will receive in connection with the transaction; and a monthly account statement indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our securities, and therefore our stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares. Blue Sky Restrictions on Resale When a Selling Security Holder wants to sell shares of our common stock under this Prospectus in the United States, the Selling Security Holder will need to comply with state securities laws, also known as blue sky laws, with regard to secondary sales. All states offer a variety of exemptions from registration of secondary sales. Many states, for example, have an exemption for secondary trading of securities registered under section 12(g) of the Exchange Act or for securities of issuers that publish continuous disclosure of financial and non-financial information in a recognized securities manual, such as Standard & Poors. The broker for a selling security holder will be able to advise the stockholder as to which states have an exemption for secondary sales of our common stock. 31 Any person who purchases shares of our common stock from a Selling Security Holder pursuant to this Prospectus, and who subsequently wants to resell such shares will also have to comply with blue sky laws regarding secondary sales. When this Registration Statement becomes effective, and a Selling Security Holder indicates in which state(s) he desires to sell his shares, we will be able to identify whether he will need to register or may rely on an exemption from registration. Item 9  Description of Securities to be Registered Our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and no authorized shares of preferred stock. Common Stock As of June 9, 2014 we had 89,030,331 shares of our common stock, options to acquire 4,720,348 shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire 13,858,245 shares of our common issued and outstanding. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase additional shares of common stock or other subscription rights. Our common stock carries no conversion rights and is not subject to redemption or to any sinking fund provisions. All shares of our common stock are entitled to share equally in dividends from sources legally available, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, and upon our liquidation or dissolution, whether voluntary or involuntary, to share equally in our assets available for distribution to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue additional shares of our common stock not to exceed the amount authorized by our Articles of Incorporation, on such terms and conditions and for such consideration as our Board may deem appropriate without further security holder action. Voting Rights Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters on which such stockholders are entitled to vote. Since the shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, the holders of more than 50% of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all the directors if they choose to do so and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any person to our Board of Directors. Dividend Policy Holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for payment of dividends. From our inception to August 12, 2011, we did not declare any dividends. We do not intend to issue any cash dividends in the future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business. However, it is possible that our management may decide to declare a cash or stock dividend in the future. Our future dividend policy will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be contingent upon future earnings, if any, our financial condition, our capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. 32 Anti-takeover Effects of Our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may have anti-takeover effects, making it more difficult for or preventing a third party from acquiring control of our company or changing its board of directors and management. According to our bylaws and articles of incorporation, neither the holders of our companys common stock have cumulative voting rights in the election of our directors. The combination of an ownership by a few stockholders of a significant portion of our companys issued and outstanding common stock and lack of cumulative voting makes it more difficult for other stockholders to replace our companys board of directors or for a third party to obtain control of our company by replacing its board of directors. Anti-takeover Effects of Nevada Law Business Combinations The business combination provisions of Sections 78.411 to 78.444, inclusive, of the Nevada Revised Statutes, or NRS, prohibit a Nevada corporation with at least 200 stockholders from engaging in various combination transactions with any interested stockholder: for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder obtained such status; or after the expiration of the three-year period, unless: the transaction is approved by the board of directors or a majority of the voting power held by disinterested stockholders, or if the consideration to be paid by the interested stockholder is at least equal to the highest of: (a) the highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the three years immediately preceding the date of the announcement of the combination or in the transaction in which it became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher, (b) the market value per share of common stock on the date of announcement of the combination and the date the interested stockholder acquired the shares, whichever is higher, or (c) for holders of preferred stock, the highest liquidation value of the preferred stock, if it is higher. A combination is defined to include mergers or consolidations or any sale, lease exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, with an interested stockholder having: (a) an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation, (b) an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation, or (c) 10% or more of the earning power or net income of the corporation. In general, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years, did own) 10% or more of a corporations voting stock. The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire our company even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price. Control Share Acquisitions The control share provisions of Sections 78.378 to 78.3793, inclusive, of the NRS, which apply only to Nevada corporations with at least 200 stockholders, including at least 100 stockholders of record who are Nevada residents, and which conduct business directly or indirectly in Nevada, prohibit an acquirer, under certain circumstances, from voting its shares of a target corporations stock after crossing certain ownership threshold percentages, unless the acquirer obtains approval of the target corporations disinterested stockholders. The statute specifies three thresholds: one-fifth or more but less than one-third, one-third but less than a majority, and a majority or more, of the outstanding voting power. Once an acquirer crosses one of the above thresholds, those shares in an offer or acquisition and acquired within 90 days thereof become control shares and such control shares are deprived of the right to vote until disinterested stockholders restore the right. These provisions also provide that if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired a majority or more of all voting power, all other stockholders who do not vote in favor of authorizing voting rights to the control shares are entitled to demand payment for the fair value of their shares in accordance with statutory procedures established for dissenters rights. 33 Transfer Agent and Registrar Our independent stock transfer agent is Olympia Trust Company at 1003-750 West Pender Street, Vancouver, BC V6C 2T8 (Telephone: 604-484-8612; Facsimile: 604-484-8638).

This LOI is not comprehensive and no business relationship is created between the Vendor and our company unless and until such time as negotiations between the Parties result in the consummation of a Definitive Agreement and such Definitive Agreement is ratified by their respective authorized representatives.

Overview of Business over the Last Five Years We were initially engaged in the acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. We commenced operations in November 2004 and discontinued such operations in April 2010. As a result, the foregoing discussion describes our companys operations while it was involved in the acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. Effective September 1, 2009, we entered into an assignment agreement with Cheetah Oil & Gas Ltd. The assignment agreement dated August 28, 2009, provides for the purchase by our company of a revenue interest of 40.432% of an 8% share of Cheetahs net revenue after field operating expenses from the Belmont Lake PP F-12-4 horizontal well, located in Belmont Lake Field, Wilkinson County, Mississippi. As consideration, we agreed to pay to Cheetah 57.76% of Cheetahs costs currently budgeted at $77,905.36, subject to revision and 57.76% of Cheetahs 8% share of PP F-12-4 well costs from time to time for infrastructure, pipes, tanks, compressors, trucking, etc. On May 31, 2010, this assigned interest was converted into common shares and warrants of Cheetah Oil & Gas Ltd, leaving our company with no direct interest in this well. As a result, we have 375,000 restricted common shares in the capital of Cheetah and 375,000 share purchase warrants which entitled our company to acquire 375,000 restricted common shares in the capital of Cheetah at a purchase price of $0.20 per share for a period of two years. 36 Effective September 1, 2009, we entered into an assignment agreement with Lexaria Corp. The assignment agreement dated August 28, 2009, provides for the purchase by our company of a revenue interest of 13.475% of a 32% share of Lexarias net revenue after field operating expenses from the Belmont Lake PP F-12-4 horizontal well, located in Belmont Lake Field, Wilkinson County, Mississippi. As consideration, we agreed to pay to Lexaria 19.25% of Lexarias costs currently budgeted at $311,621.44, subject to revision and 19.25% of Lexarias 32% share of PP F-12-4 well costs from time to time for infrastructure, pipes, tanks, compressors, trucking, etc. On May 31, 2010, this assigned interest was converted into common shares and warrants of Lexaria Corp, leaving our company with no direct interest in this well. As a result, we have 499,893 restricted common shares in the capital of Lexaria and 499,983 share purchase warrants which entitle our company to acquire 499,983 restricted common shares in the capital of Lexaria at a purchase price of $0.20 per share for a period of two years. Effective September 25, 2009, we effected a one (1) for two (2) share consolidation of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital decreased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 37,500,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and our issued and outstanding shares decreased from 29,305,480 shares of common stock to 14,652,740 shares of common stock. The consolidation became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on September 25, 2009 under the new stock symbol  GLCP . Our CUSIP number was changed to 38079Q207 . On October 9, 2009, we appointed Bal Bhullar as our chief financial officer. Concurrent with the appointment of Ms. Bhullar, we entered into an initial six-month management agreement, thereafter month to month, with BKB Management Ltd., a consulting company controlled by Bal Bhullar. On October 9, 2009, we entered into a month to month management agreement with Mark Snyder, whereby Mark Snyder agreed to act as the Chief Technical Officer of our company. On January 31, 2010, we entered into an Independent Sales and Marketing Representative Agreement with Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc., a private company beneficially owned by Mark Snyder, our companys Chief Technical Officer. On February 8, 2010, we changed our name from Golden Aria Corp. to Enertopia Corp. Our CUSIP number is 29277Q1047. On February 22, 2010, we increased our authorized share capital to 200,000,000 common shares. On February 28, 2010, we entered into an Asset and Share Purchase Agreement with Mr. Mark Snyder to acquire up to 20% ownership interest of Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc. Effective March 26, 2010, our stock quotation under the symbol GLCP was deleted from the OTC Bulletin Board. The symbol was deleted for factors beyond our companys control due to various market makers electing to shift their orders from the OTCQB to the Pink OTC Markets Inc. As a result of these market makers not providing a quote on the OTCQB for four consecutive days our company was deemed to be deficient in maintaining a listing standard at the OTCQB pursuant to Rule 15c2-11. That determination was made entirely without our companys knowledge. 37 On April 7, 2010, FINRA confirmed the name change from Golden Aria Corp. to Enertopia Corp., and approved our companys new symbol as ENRT. On February 5, 2010, our companys shareholders approved an amendment to our companys articles of incorporation to change its name from Golden Aria Corp. to Enertopia Corp. The name change was effected with the Nevada Secretary of State on February 8, 2010. On May 31, 2010, we closed a private placement financing of 557,500 units at a price of $0.15 per unit for gross proceeds of $83,625. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock in the capital of our company and one non-transferable share purchase warrant, each full warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional share of common stock in the capital of our company until May 31, 2012, at a purchase price of $0.30 per share. On August 12, 2010, we received approval for listing on the Canadian National Stock Exchange. Trading date commenced on August 13, 2010 under the symbol  TOP . During the year ended August 31, 2010, our oil and gas properties became available for sale as the result of our company shifting its focus from non-renewable energy operations to a renewable energy operation. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 360 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of long-Lived Assets, we reclassified the remaining oil and gas properties to be sold as assets held for sale and recorded at their recoverable amount on August 31, 2010. In the year ended August 31, 2011, we received a cash payment of $100,000 from the sale. On October 25, 2010, our company disposed of the Coteau Lake interests for cash consideration of $100,000 plus an additional potential payout which shall be based on a 10% profit interest on any and all productive wells drilled on the property, up to $150,000. No receivable was recorded as the future potential payout cannot be reasonably determined. On January 31, 2011, our company entered into a letter of intent and paid $7,500 deposit to Wildhorse Copper Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Wildhorse Copper (AZ) Inc. (collectively, the  Optionors ).

The Optionors hold the Copper Hills property directly and indirectly through property purchase agreements between the Optionors and third parties (collectively, the Indirect Agreements). Pursuant to the Option Agreement the Optionors have assigned the Indirect Agreements to our company. In order to earn the interest in the Copper Hills property, our company is required to make aggregate cash payments of $591,650 over an eight year period and issue an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock over a three year period.

On March 3, 2011, we closed a private placement of 8,729,000 units at a price of CAD$0.10 per unit for gross proceeds of CAD$872,900 (approximately $893,993).

We recorded $12,422 in additional paid in capital for the gain on the settlement of the debt. 38 On April 27, 2011, we entered into a debt settlement agreement with the President of our Company regarding a related party in the amount of $46,000, whereby $25,000 was settled by issuing common shares of 100,000, and $21,000 was forgiven for Nil consideration.

On June 22, 2011, we engaged MNP as our independent registered public accounting firm. On July 19, 2011, our company entered into a letter of intent and paid $15,000 deposit to Altar Resources.

Equity Investment in Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc. Effective February 28, 2010, we entered into an asset and share purchase agreement with Mr. Mark Snyder to acquire up to 20% ownership of Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc., a private company beneficially owned by Mark Snyder, our companys Chief Technical Officer. Global Solar owns certain technology invented and developed by Mark Snyder for the design and manufacture of certain water filtration equipment.

In November 2012, our company had a valuation report completed on GSWPS by RwE Growth Partners Inc. As a result, our companys long-term investment in GSWPS has been written down to $68,500.

Copper Hills Project, New Mexico 51 On January 31, 2011, our company entered into a letter of intent and paid $7,500 deposit to Wildhorse Copper Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Wildhorse Copper (AZ) Inc. (collectively, the  Optionors ). On April 11, 2011, our company signed a Mineral Purchase Option Agreement ( Option Agreement ) with the Optionors respecting an option to earn a 100% interest, subject to a 1% NSR capped to a maximum of $2,000,000 in a property known as the Copper Hills property. The Copper Hills property is comprised of 56 located mining claims covering a total of 1,150 acres located in New Mexico, USA. The Optionors hold the Copper Hills property directly and indirectly through property purchase agreements between the Optionors and third parties (collectively, the  Indirect Agreements ). Pursuant to the Option Agreement the Optionors have assigned the Indirect Agreements to our company. In order to earn the interest in the Copper Hills property, our company is required to make aggregate cash payments of $591,650 over an eight year period and issue an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock over a three year period. As at August 31, 2013, our company has issued 500,000 shares at price of $0.15 per share and 150,000 shares at price of $0.10 per share to the Optionors and made aggregate cash payment of $106,863 (August 31, 2012-$106,863); our company has expensed exploration costs of $143,680 (August 31, 2012-$143,680). On June 26, 2013, our company announced the termination of its Option Agreement.

The continuation of our diverse business sectors is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful programs of development, and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. There is significant uncertainty as to whether we can obtain additional financing. Competition There is strong competition relating to all aspects of the alternative energy sector. We will actively compete for capital, skilled personnel, energy retrofit and new alternative energy projects, and in all other aspects of its operations with a substantial number of other organizations, many of which have greater technical and financial resources than our company. Some of those organizations not only design and install alternative energy systems but also manufacture alternative energy products on a worldwide basis and as such have greater and more diverse resources on which to draw. We will actively compete for alternative energy projects and opportunities in the fields of Solar PV; Solar Thermal; Wind; Biomass; Energy Optimization and related sectors, and will constantly be facing competition by both smaller and larger companies in all geographical and industrial segments of the market.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS This Prospectus includes the following financial statements: Audited financial statements of our company for fiscal years ended August 31, 2013 and 2012; and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28, 2014 and 2013. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and are stated in United States Dollars ($). The financial statements appear beginning on page F-1. 57 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Enertopia Corp. (A development stage company) We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Enertopia Corp. (the Company) (a development stage company, formerly Golden Aria Corp.) as at August 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of stockholders equity, operations and cash flow for the years then ended and the period from November 24, 2004 (inception) to August 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit the Companys financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2010, and the cumulative data from November 24, 2004 (inception) to August 31, 2010 in the statements of stockholders equity, operations and cash flows, which were audited by other auditors whose report, dated November 25, 2010 which expressed an unqualified opinion, has been furnished to us. Our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for cumulative data from November 24, 2004 (inception) to August 31, 2010, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at August 31, 2013 and 2012 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended and the period from November 24, 2004 (inception) to August 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred losses from operations since inception, has not attained profitable operations and is dependent upon obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

(A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS August 31, 2013 (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) 1. ORGANIZATION The Company was formed on November 24, 2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada and commenced operations on November 24, 2004. The Company was an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the United States and Canada. In the fiscal year 2008, the Company shifted its strategic plan from its non-renewal energy operations to its planned renewal energy operations and natural resource acquisition and development and considered as a development stage company. Subsequent to year ended August 31, 2013, the Company began its entry into the medicinal marijuana business. The Company is diverse in its pursuit of business opportunities in several sectors. The Company has offices in Vancouver and Kelowna, B.C., Canada. 2. GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company had a working capital deficit of $471,449 for the year ended August 31, 2013 [deficit of $275,976 for year ended August 31, 2012]. The Company incurred a net loss of $730,904 for the year ended August 31, 2013 [net loss $1,009,735 for the year ended August 31, 2012] and as at August 31, 2013 has incurred cumulative losses of $6,124,658 that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management has been able, thus far, to finance the operations through equity financing and cash on hand. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to finance the Company on this basis. In view of these conditions, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt and dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, to receive the continued support of the Companys shareholders, and ultimately to obtain successful operations. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. There is significant uncertainty as to whether we can obtain additional financing. These consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly- owned subsidiary, Target Energy, Inc., and its equity interest of Pro Eco Energy Inc. and Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. b) Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes its renewal energy service revenue when services are performed and payments are received or rights to receive consideration are obtained, evidence of an arrangement exists, and collection of consideration is reasonably assured. c) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents comprise certain highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. As of August 31, 2013 and 2012, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash only. d) Investments in Companies Accounted for Using the Equity Method Investments in equity method investees are accounted for using the equity method based upon the level of ownership and/or the Companys ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Investments of this nature are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Companys proportionate share of the investees net income or losses after the date of investment. When net losses from and investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount, the investment balance is reduced to zero. The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the entity subsequently reports net income and the Companys share of that net income exceeds the share of the net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. Investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred. When an investment accounted for using the equity method issues its own shares, the subsequent reduction in the Companys proportionate interest in the investee is reflected in income as a deemed dilution gain or loss on disposition. The Company evaluates its investments in companies accounted for the equity or cost method for impairment when there is evidence or indicators that a decrease in value may be other than temporary. e) Mineral Property Rights Acquisition and Exploration and Development Expenditures Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized as tangible assets when purchased. The Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment when indicators of impairment exist. If proven and probable reserves are established for a property and it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed, costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated total recoverable proven and probable reserves. Mineral property exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred until the establishment of economically viable reserves. f) Stock-Based Compensation The Company followed Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718,  Compensation  Stock Compensation , to account for its stock options and similar equity instruments issued. Accordingly, compensation costs attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the expected vesting period. ASC 718 requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. g) Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. h) Loss Per Share Loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The Company has adopted ASC 220  Earnings Per Share . Diluted loss per share is equivalent to basic loss per share because the potential exercise of the equity-based financial instruments was anti-dilutive. i) Foreign Currency Translations The Companys operations are located in the United States of America and Canada, and it has offices in Canada. The Company maintains its accounting records in U.S. Dollars, as follows: At the transaction date, each asset, liability, revenue and expense that was acquired or incurred in a foreign currency is translated into U.S. dollars by the using of the exchange rate in effect at that date. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at that date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are included in operations. j) Financial Instruments ASC 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing. The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, owned securities, accounts payable, short term loan, due to related parties, and warrants liability. With the exception of owned securities, non-current portion of promissory notes and warrants liability, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. The fair values of the non-current portion of promissory notes are estimated using quoted market prices or are based on the discounted value of future cash flows. The fair value of owned securities are measured based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair value of the warrants liability is determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company’s operations are in Canada, which results in exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The financial risk is the risk to the Company’s operations that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. k) Income Taxes The Company has adopted ASC 740, “ Income Taxes” , which requires the Company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. In addition, a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset for which it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. l) Long-Lived Assets Impairment Long-term assets of the Company are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the guidance established in ASC 360, “ Property, Plant and Equipment ’. For assets that are to be held and used, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value. Fair values are determined based on discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. m) Asset Retirement Obligations The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations ”. ASC 410 requires the Company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. The management of the Company had estimated the asset retirement obligation to be immaterial and therefore was not reflected on the consolidated financial statements as of August 31, 2013 and 2012. n) Comprehensive Income The Company has adopted ASC 220, “ Comprehensive Income” , which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. The Company is disclosing this information on its Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. o) Concentration of credit risk The Company places its cash and cash equivalent with high credit quality financial institution. As of August 31, 2013, the Company had $Nil in a bank beyond insured limit (August 31, 2012: $Nil). p) New Accounting Pronouncements In December, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, “Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities”, in an effort to improve comparability between US GAAP and IFRS financial statements with regard to the presentation of offsetting assets and liabilities on the statement of financial position arising from financial and derivative instruments, and repurchase agreements. The ASU establishes additional disclosures presenting the gross amounts of recognized assets and liabilities, offsetting amounts, and the net balance reflected in the statement of financial position. Descriptive information regarding the nature and rights of the offset must also be disclosed. This guidance is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after January 1, 2013. The adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220); Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." This updated guidance improves the reporting of significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and requires an entity to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, separately for each component of comprehensive income, the current period reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income affected by the reclassification. The updated guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s financial statements. In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-05, "Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830); Parent’s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity." This guidance applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business (other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral rights) within a foreign entity. ASU No. 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our fiscal quarter starting from March 1, 2014. We are currently reviewing the provisions of ASU No. 2013-05 on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. This new guidance provides specific financial statement presentation requirements of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance states that an unrecognized tax benefit in those circumstances should be presented as a reduction to the deferred tax asset. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements upon adoption. 4.

(A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS February 28, 2014 (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) 1. ORGANIZATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the period ended February 28, 2014 included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the August 31, 2013 audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The Company was formed on November 24, 2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada and commenced operations on November 24, 2004. The Company was an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the United States and Canada. In the fiscal year 2010, the Company shifted its strategic plan from its non-renewal energy operations to its planned renewal energy operations and natural resource acquisition and development. In late summer of 2013, the Company added another business sector in its entrance to medical marijuana and is considered a development stage company. The Company has offices in Vancouver and Kelowna, B.C., Canada. Effective September 25, 2009, we effected one (1) for two (2) share consolidation of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. On February 8, 2010, the Company changed its name from Golden Aria Corp. to Enertopia Corp. On February 22, 2010, the Company increased its authorized share capital to 200,000,000 common shares. 2. GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company incurred a net loss of $472,213 for the six months ended February 28, 2014 [net loss of $191,108 for the six months ended February 28, 2013] and as at February 28, 2014 has incurred cumulative losses of $6,596,871 that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management has been able, thus far, to finance the operations through equity financing and cash on hand. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to finance the Company on this basis. In view of these conditions, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt and dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, to receive the continued support of the Companys shareholders, and ultimately to obtain successful operations. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. There is significant uncertainty as to whether we can obtain additional financing. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of Consolidation The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Target Energy, Inc., which has been dissolved effective November 4, 2013 with no significant accounting impact, equity interest of Pro Eco Energy Inc., which has been sold on December 2, 2013 with a gain of approximately $7,000, Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc. has been written down to $1, 30% inerest of World of Maihuana Productions Ltd. (WOM) and 49% interest of the Green Canvas Ltd. (" GCL) . All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. b) New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-05, "Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830); Parents Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity." This guidance applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business (other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral rights) within a foreign entity. ASU No. 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our fiscal quarter starting from March 1, 2014. We are currently reviewing the provisions of ASU No. 2013-05 on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. This new guidance provides specific financial statement presentation requirements of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance states that an unrecognized tax benefit in those circumstances should be presented as a reduction to the deferred tax asset. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements upon adoption. 4.

From inception until April 2008, we were primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. Beginning in April 2008, we began our entry into the clean energy sector by purchasing an interest in a solar thermal design and installation company. In late summer 2013, we began our entry into medicinal marijuana business. Our company is diverse in its pursuit of business opportunities in several sectors, including: Medicinal Marijuana, Oil and Gas, Solar PV (Photovoltaic), Solar Thermal (Hot Water), Energy Retrofits and Recovery, and Solar powered Filtered Drinking Water. 55 The address of our principal executive office is Suite 950, 1130 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6E 4A4. Our telephone number is (604) 602-1633. We have another office located in Kelowna. Our current locations provide adequate office space for our purposes at this stage of our development. Due to the implementation of British Columbia Instrument 51-509 on September 30, 2008 by the British Columbia Securities Commission, we have been deemed to be a British Columbia based reporting issuer. As such, we are required to file certain information and documents at www.sedar.com. Effective September 25, 2009, we effected a one (1) for two (2) share consolidation of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital decreased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 37,500,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and our issued and outstanding shares decreased from 29,305,480 shares of common stock to 14,652,740 shares of common stock.

Our new CUSIP number at that time was 38079Q207. On October 9, 2009, we appointed Bal Bhullar as our chief financial officer. Concurrent with the appointment of Ms. Bhullar, we entered into an initial six-month management agreement, thereafter month to month, with BKB Management Ltd., a consulting company controlled by Bal Bhullar. On January 31, 2010, our company entered into an Independent Sales and Marketing Representative Agreement with Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc.

Effective February 28, 2010, we entered into an asset and share purchase agreement with Mr. Mark Snyder to acquire up to 20% ownership of Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc., a private company beneficially owned by Mark Snyder, our companys Chief Technical Officer.

In order to earn the interest in the Copper Hills property, our company is required to make aggregate cash payments of $591,650 over an eight year period and issue an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock over a three year period.

Until such time as the Vendor and our company enter into a Definitive Agreement, the Parties agree that all terms of this LOI are and shall serve only as an expression of interest between the Vendor and our company. This LOI is not comprehensive and no business relationship is created between the Vendor and our company unless and until such time as negotiations between the Parties result in the consummation of a Definitive Agreement and such Definitive Agreement is ratified by their respective authorized representatives.

The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of exploration and/or development, and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. Purchase of Significant Equipment We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment over the twelve months ending November 30, 2014 other than office computers, furnishings, and communication equipment as required. Corporate Offices The address of our principal executive office is Suite 950, 1130 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6E 4A4. Our telephone number is (604) 602-1675. We have another office located in Kelowna. Our current locations provide adequate office space for our purposes at this stage of our development. 63 Employees We primarily used the services of sub-contractors and consultants for our intended business operations. Our only technical employee is Mr. McAllister, our president and a director. We entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Robert McAllister on December 1, 2007. During the term of this agreement, Mr. McAllister is to provide corporate administration and consulting services, such duties and responsibilities to include provision of oil and gas industry consulting services, strategic corporate and financial planning, management of the overall business operations of our company, and supervising office staff and exploration and oil & gas consultants. Mr. McAllister is reimbursed at the rate of $2,000 per month. On December 1, 2008, the consulting fee was increased to $5,000 per month. We may terminate this agreement without prior notice based on a number of conditions. Mr. McAllister may terminate the agreement at any time by giving 30 days written notice of his intention to do so. On October 9, 2009, our company entered into a consulting agreement with BKB Management Ltd, a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. BKB Management controlled by the chief financial officer of our company. A fee of CAD$4,675 including GST was paid per month. We may terminate this agreement without prior notice based on a number of conditions. BKB Management Ltd. may terminate the agreement at any time by giving 30 days written notice of his intention to do so. Effective April 1, 2011, the fee is CAD$5,500 plus GST. Effective March 1, 2014, the Company entered into a new Management Consulting Agreement replacing the original agreement with a consulting fee of CAD$7,500 plus GST per month. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next 12 month period. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed. However, with project advancement and if we are successful in our initial and any subsequent drilling programs we may retain additional employees. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials. Long-Lived Assets Long-term assets of our company are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the guidance established in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. For assets that are to be held and used, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value. Fair values are determined based on discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. 64 Revenue Recognition Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded using the sales method whereby our company recognizes oil and natural gas revenue based on the amount of oil and gas sold to purchasers when title passes, the amount is determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Actual sales of gas are based on sales, net of the associated volume charges for processing fees and for costs associated with delivery, transportation, marketing, and royalties in accordance with industry standards. Operating costs and taxes are recognized in the same period of which revenue is earned. Going Concern We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon our Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and/or raising additional capital. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recovery and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should our Company discontinue operations. The continuation of our business is dependent upon us raising additional financial support and/or attaining and maintaining profitable levels of internally generated revenue. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830); Parents Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity. This guidance applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business (other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral rights) within a foreign entity. ASU No. 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our fiscal quarter starting from March 1, 2014. We are currently reviewing the provisions of ASU No. 2013-05 on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. This new guidance provides specific financial statement presentation requirements of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance states that an unrecognized tax benefit in those circumstances should be presented as a reduction to the deferred tax asset. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. Early adoption is permitted. Our company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 65 Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our companys financial statements upon adoption. Results of Operations  Three Months Ended February 28, 2014 and 2013 The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the quarter ended February 28, 2014, which are included herein. Our operating results for the three months ended February 28, 2014, for the three months ended February 28, 2013 and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows: Three Months Ended February 28, 2014 Three Months Ended February 28, 2013 Change Between Three Month Period Ended February 28, 2014 and February 28, 2013 Revenue (cost recovery) $ Nil $ Nil $ Nil Other (income) expenses (85,576) (850) (84,726) General and administrative 237,228 73,392 163,837 Interest expense 2,878 1,716 1,162 Consulting fees 124,784 49,655 75,129 Exploration expenses Nil 3,310 (3,310) Professional Fees 13,723 5,297 8,426 Net income (loss) (322,804) (74,242) (248,562) Our accumulated losses increased to $6,596,871 at February 28, 2014. Our financial statements report a net loss of $322,804 for the three-month period ended February 28, 2014, compared to a net loss of $74,242 for the three-month period ended February 28, 2013. Our net losses have increased by $248,562 for the three month period ended February 28, 2014, our general and administrative expenses were higher by $163,838 for February 28, 2014 compared to February 28, 2013. The increase was largely due to higher advertising and marketing costs of $44,197 for the three month period ended February 28, 2014, compared to $201 for February 28, 2013. In addition the Company incurred $12,629 for investor relations and increased costs in consulting fees by $75,129 for the three month period ended February 28, 2014.

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common stock and other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% percent beneficial owners were complied with, with the exception of the following: Name Number of Late Reports Number of Transactions Not Reported on a Timely Basis Failure to File Requested Forms Robert McAllister 1 (1) 1 N/A Bal Bhullar 1 (1) 1 N/A John Thomas 1 (2) 1 N/A Notes: (1) The director / officer was late filing a Form 4, Change of Beneficial Ownership. (2) The director / officer was late filing a Form 3, Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership. Code of Ethics We have not adopted a code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors and employees. When we do adopt a code of ethics, we will disclose it in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a member of its audit committee that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We believe that our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our directors do not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because they believe the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors. 72 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The particulars of the compensation paid to the following persons: (a) our principal executive officer; (b) each of our two most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers at the end of the years ended August 31, 2013 and 2012; and (c) up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been provided under (b) but for the fact that the individual was not serving as our executive officer at the end of the years ended August 31, 2013 and 2012, who we will collectively refer to as the named executive officers of our Company, are set out in the following summary compensation table, except that no disclosure is provided for any named executive officer, other than our principal executive officers, whose total compensation did not exceed $100,000 for the respective fiscal year: SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE Name and Principal Position Year Salary ($) Bonus ($) Stock Awards ($) Option Awards (#) Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation ($) Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings ($) All Other Compensation tion ($) Total ($) Robert McAllister (1) President and Director 2013 2012 $60,000 $60,000 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil $60,000 $60,000 Gerald Carlson (2) Former Director and President 2013 2012 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil John Thomas Director 2013 2012 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil 250,000 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Donald Findlay Director 2013 2012 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Greg Dawson (5) Former Director 2013 2012 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Chris Bunka (3) Former Chief Executive Officer, Director and Chief Financial Officer 2013 2012 $55,000 (3) $60,000 (3) Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil $55,000 $60,000 Bal Bhullar Chief Financial Officer 2013 2012 $71,416 $65,543 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil $71,416 $65,543 Mark Snyder (5) Former Chief Technical Officer 2013 2012 $6,000 $12,000 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil $42,000 $6,000 $54,000 Mathew Chadwick (6) Senior Vice President of Marijuana Operations and Director 2013 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil (1) On November 30, 2007, Mr. McAllister was appointed as our President and on April 14, 2008 he was appointed as a director.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the persons actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on April 14, 2014. As of June 9, 2014, there were 89,030,331 shares of our companys common stock issued and outstanding. Changes in Control We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of our company. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer, shareholder holding at least 5% of shares of our common stock, or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended August 31, 2013, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for the last two completed fiscal years. For the year ended August 31, 2013, our company was party to the following related party transactions: Paid/accrued $60,000 (August 31, 2012: $60,000) to the President of our company in consulting fees. Paid/accrued $55,000 (August 31, 2012: $60,000) of consulting fees to a company controlled by a former Director/CEO of our company. Paid/accrued CAD$64,435 (August 31, 2012: $65,543) in consulting fees to a company controlled by the CFO of our company. 79 Paid/accrued $6,040 (August 31, 2012: $9,000) in consulting fee former CTO of our company. Paid/accrued $110 (August 31, 2012: $9,375) in consulting fee to former Senior VP, Business Development. Included in accounts payable, $123,610 was payable to the President and a company controlled by a CFO of our company. On February 9, 2012, our company signed a Loan Agreement with Robert McAllister, director of our company to borrow $50,000 (CAD$50,000). The loan is unsecured, was due on May 9, 2012 at an interest rate of 10% per annum and is now on a month to month term. Director Independence We currently act with four (4) directors, consisting of Robert McAllister, Donald Findlay, John Thomas and Mathew Chadwick. We have determined that Donald Findlay and John Thomas are an independent director as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15). Currently our audit committee consists of all of our board of directors. We currently do not have nominating, compensation committees or committees performing similar functions. There has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a member of its audit committee who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. From inception to present date, we believe that the members of our audit committee and the board of directors have been and are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We do not have a standing compensation or nominating committee, but our entire board of directors act in such capacity. We believe that our directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Our directors do not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because we believe that the functions of an audit committee can be adequately performed by the board of directors. In addition, we believe that retaining additional independent directors who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development. Item 12A  Disclosure of Commission Position on Indemnification of Securities Act Liabilities Our bylaws provide that we indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by Nevada law. The general effect of the foregoing is to indemnify a control person, officer or director from liability, thereby making us responsible for any expenses or damages incurred by such control person, officer or director in any action brought against them based on their conduct in such capacity, provided they did not engage in fraud or criminal activity. 80 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or control persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes ( NRS ) provides that neither a director nor an officer of a Nevada corporation can be held personally liable to the corporation, its stockholders or its creditors unless the director or officer committed both a breach of fiduciary duty and such breach was accompanied by intentional misconduct, fraud, or knowing violation of law. Nevada does not exclude breaches of the duty of loyalty or instances where the director has received an improper personal benefit. A Nevada corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding, if he is not liable under NRS 78.138 (see above), acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. However, with respect to actions by or in the right of the corporation, no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper. A director or officer who is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any proceeding subject to the Nevada corporate statutes indemnification provisions must be indemnified by the corporation for reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith, including attorneys fees. Our companys bylaws provide that the corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the NRS, indemnify and hold harmless any and all persons whom it shall have power to indemnify under said provisions from and against any and all liabilities (including expenses) imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with any action, suit or other proceeding in which he or she may be involved or with which he or she may be threatened, or other matters referred to in or covered by said provisions both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the corporation. Our companys bylaws do not modify Nevada law in this respect. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. We have no liability insurance. 81 DEALER PROSPECTUS DELIVERY OBLIGATION Until a date, which is 90 days after the date of this Prospectus, all dealers that effect transactions in these securities whether or not participating in this offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus. This is in addition to the dealers obligation to deliver a prospectus when acting as underwriters and with respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions. PART II  INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS Item 13  Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution No expenses will be borne by the Selling Security Holders. Our estimated expenses in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities being registered in this Prospectus are as follows: Commission filing fee $ 668.18 Legal fees and expenses 10,000.00 Accounting fees and expenses 3,000.00 Total $ 13,668.18 Item 14  Indemnification of Directors and Officers Section 78.138 of the NRS provides that a director or officer will not be individually liable unless it is proven that (i) the directors or officers acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, and (ii) such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law. Section 78.7502 of NRS permits a company to indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding if the officer or director (i) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, if a criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director was unlawful. Section 78.751 of NRS permits a Nevada company to indemnify its officers and directors against expenses incurred by them in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the company. Section 78.751 of NRS further permits the company to grant its directors and officers additional rights of indemnification under its articles of incorporation or bylaws or otherwise. Section 78.752 of NRS provides that a Nevada company may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against him and liability and expenses incurred by him in his capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the company has the authority to indemnify him against such liability and expenses. 82 Our Articles of Incorporation provide that no director or officer of our company will be personally liable to our company or any of its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer (i) for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or (ii) the unlawful payment of dividends. In addition, our bylaws permit for the indemnification and insurance provisions in Chapter 78 of the NRS. Insofar as indemnification by us for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. At the present time, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director, officer, employee or other agent of ours in which indemnification would be required or permitted. We are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding, which may result in a claim for such indemnification. Further, in the normal course of business, we may have in our contracts indemnification clauses, written as either mutual where each party will indemnify, defend, and hold each other harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties; or single where we have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses etc. Our Bylaws Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by Nevada law. The general effect of the foregoing is to indemnify a control person, officer or director from liability, thereby making us responsible for any expenses or damages incurred by such control person, officer or director in any action brought against them based on their conduct in such capacity, provided they did not engage in fraud or criminal activity.

To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; 2. That for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; 3. To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering; and 4. That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the registrant or used or referred to by the registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the registrant; and 92 (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the registrant to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 93 Signatures Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on June 11, 2014.
