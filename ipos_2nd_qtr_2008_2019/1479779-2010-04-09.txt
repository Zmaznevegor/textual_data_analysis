In the event that we sell at least the minimum number of shares in this offering, of which there is no assurance, we intend to have our shares of common stock quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

The offering price is $0.01 per share. In the event that 1,000,000 shares are not sold within 270 days, all money received by us will be promptly returned to you without interest or deduction of any kind.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SWORDFISH VENTURES CORPORATION. BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment. WE LACK AN OPERATING HISTORY AND HAVE LOSSES THAT WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS WILL RESULT IN PROFITABLE REVENUES. IF WE CANNOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO OPERATE PROFITABLY, WE WILL CEASE OPERATIONS AND YOU WILL LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. We were incorporated on October 29, 2009 and we have not started our proposed business operations or realized any revenues. We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon: * completion of this offering; * our ability to create a viable distribution and a data collection mode for our service; and, * our ability to generate ad revenues through the use of our product. 4 <PAGE> Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods since we will be incurring expenses and not generating revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenues in the future. Failure to generate revenues will cause you to lose your investment. IF WE DO NOT ATTRACT USERS, WE WILL NOT MAKE A PROFIT WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL RESULT IN A CESSATION OF OPERATIONS. We have no web portal. We have not identified any actual locations for Our web portal and we cannot guarantee we will ever have any customers using this service. Even if we obtain users, there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a profit, we will have to suspend or cease operations. WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES. IF WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS AND ARE UNABLE TO RAISE THEM WE WILL HAVE TO TERMINATE OUR OPERATIONS. We have not yet started our business. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations. If the minimum of $10,000 is raised, this amount will enable us, after paying the expenses of this offering, to operate for one year. If we need additional funds and are unable to raise the money, we will have to cease operations. IF WE DO NOT EARN A PROFIT, WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS. Since we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit marketing our services. The sale of services is how we will initially generate revenues. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES THAT MAY CAUSE US TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS. Our sole officer and director, Mr. Hai, will only be devoting limited time to our operations. Mr. Hai, our president and sole director will be devoting approximately 20 hours per week of his working time to our operations. Because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations. BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY ONE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WHO HAS NO FORMAL TRAINING IN FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR MANAGERIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, IN THE FUTURE, THERE MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE AND ACCOUNTING CONTROLS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES AND ASSESSMENTS AGAINST US. We have only one officer and director. He has no formal training in financial accounting and management; however, he is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. When the disclosure and accounting controls referred to above are implemented, he will be responsible for the administration of them. Should he not have sufficient experience, he may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the SEC which ultimately 5 <PAGE> could cause you to lose your investment. However, because of the small size of our expected operations, we believe that he will be able to monitor the controls he will have created and will be accurate in assembling and providing information to investors. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING: BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, IF WE FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION OR ARE FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY, OR A CREDITOR OBTAINS A JUDGMENT AGAINST US AND ATTACHES THE SUBSCRIPTION, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. Your funds will not be placed in an escrow or trust account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to bankruptcy laws. If a creditor sues us and obtains a judgment against us, the creditor could garnish the bank account and take possession of the subscriptions. As such, if the minimum conditions of this offering are not satisfied, it is possible that a creditor could attach your subscription which could preclude or delay the return of money to you. If that happens, you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors. BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WHO IS ALSO OUR SOLE PROMOTER, WILL OWN 80% OF OUR TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IF THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF THE OFFERING IS SOLD AND 67% OF OUR TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE OFFERING IS SOLD, HE WILL RETAIN CONTROL OF US AND WILL BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE DIRECTORS AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ELECT ANY DIRECTORS WHICH COULD DECREASE THE PRICE AND MARKETABILITY OF OUR SHARES. Even if we sell all 2,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering, Gao Hai will own 66.67% of the total outstanding common stock; if the minimum amount of the offering is sold he will own 80% of the total outstanding common stock. As a result, after completion of this offering, regardless of the number of shares we sell, Mr. Hai will be able to elect all of our directors and control our operations, which could decrease the price and marketability of our shares. BECAUSE THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL YOUR STOCK. There is currently no public trading market for our common stock. Therefore there is no central place, such as stock exchange or electronic trading system, to resell your shares. If you want to resell your shares, you will have to locate a buyer and negotiate your own sale. BECAUSE THE SEC IMPOSES ADDITIONAL SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS ON BROKERS WHO DEAL IN OUR SHARES THAT ARE PENNY STOCKS, SOME BROKERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO TRADE THEM. THIS MEANS THAT YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY RESELLING YOUR SHARES AND THIS MAY CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES TO DECLINE. 6 <PAGE> Our shares would be classified as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated there under which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokers/dealers who sell our securities in this offering or in the aftermarket. For sales of our securities, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from you a written agreement prior to making a sale for you. Because of the imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that brokers will not want to make a market in our shares. This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the price of our shares to decline. FINRA SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. The FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock. Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made in a direct public offering, without any involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers, 1,000,000 common shares minimum, 2,000,000 common shares maximum basis. The table below sets forth the use of proceeds if 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 common shares of the offering are sold. 1,000,000 2,000,000 ------- --------- Gross proceeds $ 10,000 $ 20,000 Offering expenses $ 5,000 $ 5,000 Net proceeds $ 5,000 $ 15,000 The net proceeds will be used as follows: Concept development $ 1,000 $ 3,000 Marketing and advertising $ 500 $ 3,000 Equipment $ 1,000 $ 3,000 Legal, Audit, accounting and filing fees $ 2,000 $ 5,000 Other expenses $ 500 $ 1,000 TOTAL $ 5,000 $ 15,000 7 <PAGE> Total offering expenses of $50,000 to be paid from the proceeds of the offering are for legal fees and auditing fees related to this offering. No other expenses of the offering will be paid from the proceeds. After the completion of this offering, we intend to initiate the development of our website "WWW.SWORDFISHVENTURES.CN" We intend to hire an outside web designer to assist us in designing and building our website. Also in the first year following our offering, we plan to open a web service in the city of Changchun, China. Marketing and advertising will be focused on promoting our karaoke restaurant chain, advertising in local newspapers, magazines, city billboards, online, etc. The cost of establishing a web site is estimated to be $3,000. We estimate our auditing and accounting fees to be $5,000 during the next twelve months. We have allocated between $500 and $1,000 for additional unforeseen expenses which may arise as a result of initiating our operations. The proceeds from the offering will allow us to operate for twelve months, whether the minimum or maximum amount is raised. Gao Hai our sole officer and director determined that the funds would last twelve months, including filing reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the business activities contemplated by our business plan. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily determined in order for us to raise a minimum of $10,000 and a maximum of $20,000 in this offering. The offering price bears no relationship to our assets, earnings, book value or other criteria of value. Among the factors we considered were: * our lack of operating history; * the proceeds to be raised by the offering; * the amount of capital to be contributed by purchasers in this offering in proportion to the amount of stock to be retained by our existing stockholder; and * our relative cash requirements. DILUTION OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of our shares being 8 <PAGE> offered. Dilution of the value of our shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of our shares held by our existing stockholders. As of February, 2010, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was approximately -$0.00034 per share based upon 4,000,000 shares outstanding. IF 100% OF THE SHARES ARE SOLD: Upon completion of this offering, in the event all of our shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 6,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $18,633 or approximately $0.0031 per share. The net tangible book value of our shares held by our existing stockholder will be increased by $0.003134 per share without any additional investment on their part. You will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0031 per share After completion of this offering, if 2,000,000 shares are sold, you will own 33% of the total number of outstanding shares for which you will have made a cash investment of $20,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholders will own 67% of the total number of outstanding shares for which they have made cash contributions totaling $nil or approximately $0.00000 per share. IF 75% OF THE SHARES ARE SOLD: Upon completion of this offering, in the event 75% of the shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 5,500,000 shares then outstanding will be $13,633, or approximately $0.0025 per share. The net tangible book value of our shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0028 per share without any additional investment on their part. You will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0025 per share. After completion of this offering, if 1,500,000 shares are sold, you will own approximately 27% of the total number of outstanding shares for which you will have made a cash investment of $15,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholders will own approximately 73% of the total number of outstanding shares for which they have made cash contributions totaling nil or approximately $0.00000 per share. IF THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES IS SOLD: Upon completion of this offering, in the event 50% or the minimum amount of shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 5,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $8,633 or approximately $0.0017 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0021 per share without any additional investment on their part. You will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0017 per share. After completion of this offering, if 1,000,000 shares are sold, you will own approximately 20% of the total number of outstanding shares for which you will have made a cash investment of $10,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholders will own approximately 80% of the total number of outstanding shares for which they have made cash contributions totaling nil or approximately $0.00000 per share. The following table compares the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders. 9 <PAGE> EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS IF ALL OF THE SHARES ARE SOLD: Price per share $ 0.00000 Net tangible book value per share before offering $ (0.00034) Potential gain to existing shareholders $ 20,000 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0031 Increase to present stockholders in net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0034 Capital contributions $ 0 Number of shares outstanding before the offering 4,000,000 Number of shares after offering assuming the sale of the maximum number of shares 6,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 67% PURCHASERS OF SHARES IN THIS OFFERING IF ALL SHARES SOLD Price per share $ 0.01 Dilution per share $ 0.0069 Capital contributions $ 20,000 Number of shares after offering held by public investors 2,000,000 Percentage of capital contributions by existing shareholders 0.00% Percentage of capital contributions by new investors 100% Percentage of ownership after offering 33% PURCHASERS OF SHARES IN THIS OFFERING IF 75% OF SHARES SOLD Price per share $ 0.01 Dilution per share $ 0.0075 Capital contributions $ 15,000 Number of shares after offering held by public investors 1,500,000 Percentage of capital contributions by existing shareholders 0.000% Percentage of capital contributions by new investors 100% Percentage of ownership after offering 27% PURCHASERS OF SHARES IN THIS OFFERING IF 50% OF SHARES SOLD Price per share $ 0.01 Dilution per share $ 0.008 Capital contributions $ 10,000 Percentage of capital contributions by existing shareholders 0.000% Percentage of capital contributions by new investors 100.0% Number of shares after offering held by public investors 1,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 20% 10 <PAGE> PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION; TERMS OF THE OFFERING We are offering up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock on a self-underwritten basis, 1,000,000 shares minimum, 2,000,000 shares maximum.

SECTION 15(g) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT - PENNY STOCK RULES The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which: * contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; * contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements; * contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including "BID" and "ASK" prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; * contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; * defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and * contains such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size, and format) as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. 12 <PAGE> The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer: * with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; * the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; * the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and * monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our securities because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, security holders may have difficulty selling those securities. REGULATION M Our sole officer and director, who will sell the shares, is aware that he is required to comply with the provisions of Regulation M, promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. With certain exceptions, Regulation M precludes officers and/or directors, sales agents, any broker-dealers or other person who participate in the distribution of shares in this offering from bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any security which is the subject of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete. OFFERING PERIOD AND EXPIRATION DATE This offering will start on the date that this registration statement is declared effective by the SEC and continue for a period of 270 days, or sooner if the offering is completed or otherwise terminated by us. We will not accept any money until this registration statement is declared effective by the SEC. PROCEDURES FOR SUBSCRIBING We will not accept any money until this registration statement is declared effective by the SEC.

Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. We are a development stage corporation and have not started operations and have not yet generated or realized any revenues. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete the development of our website and begin implementing and marketing our web service to our target markets. We believe the technical aspects of our website will be sufficiently developed to use for our operations within 90 days from the completion of our offering. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company. We must raise cash to implement our project and begin our operations. Whether we raise the minimum or maximum amount of money in this offering, it will last twelve months. The difference between the minimum and maximum amount relates to the website development; marketing and advertising; equipment and office furniture; and hiring one employee. In each case, if we raise the maximum amount, we will devote more funds to the same in order to enhance the quality of the website and promote our business plan to potential customers. We will not begin operations until we raise money from this offering. We have only one officer and director. He is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. When these controls are implemented, he will be responsible for the administration of the controls. Should he not have sufficient experience, he may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the SEC which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment. PLAN OF OPERATION Assuming we raise the minimum amount in this offering, we believe we can satisfy our cash requirements during the next 12 months. We will not be conducting any product research or development. We do not expect to purchase any significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees. Upon completion of our public offering, our goal is to commence our operations. We intend to accomplish the foregoing through the following milestones: 1. Complete our public offering. We believe that we will raise sufficient capital to begin our operations, and we believe that this could take up to 270 days from the date the Securities and Exchange Commission declares our offering effective. We will not begin operations until we have closed this offering. We intend to concentrate all of our efforts on raising as much capital as we can during this period. 14 <PAGE> 2. After completion of the offering, we will immediately begin to develop our website. We believe that our website can be fully operational within 90 days. In the beginning of our business operations we plan to advertise our business on the local billboards. 3. After our website is established, we intend to begin to market our business to potential customers and investors through our website, our newspaper advertisements and by personal contacts through Mr. Hai, our president. After basic marketing is completed, we plan to lease retail space in the central area of the city of Changchun, China. Within 120 days after we complete our public offering, we should be in the position to establish our first web service. We will attempt to open our business on a cost-sharing basis with potential vendors in Changchum, China. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to continue operations, we will suspend or cease operations. If we cease operations, we do not know what we will do and we do not have any plans to do anything else. LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in development stage operations and have not yet generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns. In addition to this offering, we are seeking equity financing in order to obtain the capital required to implement our business plan. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to our existing shareholders. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM INCEPTION ON OCTOBER 29, 2009 TO February 28, 2010 During this period we incorporated the company and hired an auditor for the preparation of this registration statement. We also prepared an internal business plan. Our loss since inception is nil. We have not yet started our proposed business operations and will not do so until we have completed this offering. We expect to begin operations within 120 days after we complete this offering. Since inception, we have issued 4,000,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director. 15 <PAGE> LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to begin operations but we cannot guarantee that once we begin operations we will stay in business after operations have commenced. If we are unable to successfully attract customers to utilize our web service, we may use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources, like a second public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from our officers or others in order for us to continue our operations. At present, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional capital, other than through this offering. Our sole officer and director is willing to loan us money for our operations until this offering has been completed or until the offering period has expired. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the capital or cease operations entirely. If we raise the minimum amount of money from this offering, it will last one year. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans. As of the date of this prospectus, we have yet to generate any revenues from our business operations. We issued 4,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Regulation S of the General Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. This was accounted for as a sale of common stock. As of February 28,2010 our total assets were $0 and our total liabilities were $275. BUSINESS GENERAL We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 29, 2009. We have not started operations. We are developing a website "WWW.SWORDFISHCAPITAL.CN". In the beginning of our business operations, we plan to advertise our business on the local billboards that will promote our business locally. We intend to open our first karaoke studio in the city of Changchun, China. We have not yet generated any revenues and the only operations that we have engaged in is the development of a business plan. Our business office is located at Room B3 20 th Floor Boldwin Industrial Building. 16-18 Wah Sing Street, Kwai Chung N.T . Hong Kong. Our telephone number is (852) 69463282. This is the office of our President, Gao Hai. We have no plans to change our planned business activities or to combine with another business, and we are not aware of any events or circumstances that might cause these plans to change. We have not yet begun operations and will not begin operations until we have completed this offering. Our plan of operation is forward looking and there is no assurance that we will ever begin operations. We have not conducted any market research into the likelihood of success of our operations or the acceptance of our products or advisory services by the public. 16 <PAGE> OUR STRATEGY We intend to create a chain of karaoke studios. Currently, we do not have any customers or any contracts for our service. We also have not yet commenced any operations. TARGET MARKET We intend to target the city of Changchun, China. In our first year of operation, we plan to open our first karaoke studio. Furthermore, we plan on selling food and drink to the customers at our various studio locations. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS We might be required to obtain special licenses, or meet special regulatory requirements before establishing our business, other than a business license. If new government regulations, laws, or licensing requirements are passed that would restrict or eliminate delivery of any of our intended services, then our business may suffer. For example, if we were required to obtain a government issued liquor license for the purpose of opening the karaoke studio, then we may not be able to qualify for such a license. If such a licensing requirement existed, and we were not able to qualify, then our business would suffer. MARKETING Initially, our services will be promoted by Mr. Hai. He will discuss our services with his friends and business associates. We also anticipate utilizing other marketing avenues in our attempt to make our services known to the general public and attract potential customers. These marketing activities will be designed to inform potential customers about the benefits of using our services and may include the following: development and distribution of marketing literature; direct mail and email advertising; billboards advertisement and, promotion of our web site. REVENUE We intend to generate revenues by selling our karaoke product. Therefore, we will require substantial start-up capital in order to setup our location and begin operations. Gao Hai, our president, will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week of his time to our operations. Once we begin operations Mr. Hai has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Mr. Hai will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to Mr. Hai. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations. EMPLOYEES; IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director. We intend to hire additional employees when they are needed. OFFICES Our offices are currently located at Room B3 20 th Floor Boldwin Industrial Building. 16-18 Wah Sing Street, Kwai Chung N.T. Hong Kong. Our telephone number is (852) 69463282. 17 MANAGEMENT OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS Our sole director will serve until his successor is elected and qualified. Our sole officer is elected by the board of directors to a term of one year and serves until his successor is duly elected and qualified, or until he is removed from office. Our board of directors has no nominating, auditing or compensation committees. The name, address, age and position of our sole officer and director is set forth below: Name and Address Age Positions ---------------- --- --------- Gao Hai 28 President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Room B3 20 th Floor Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, and the Boldwin Industrial Building sole member of the Board of Directors 16-18 Wah Sing Street Kwai Chung, N.T.

From 2000-2004 Mr. Hai obtained his Degree in Computer Science, University of Jilin. From 2005-present he has worked as a Web Developer at Shen Da Technology Ltd in Luohu District, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT The functions of the Audit Committee are currently carried out by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that we do not have an audit committee financial expert on our Board of Directors carrying out the duties of the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has determined that the cost of hiring a financial expert to act as a director and to be a member of the Audit Committee or otherwise perform Audit Committee functions outweighs the benefits of having a financial expert on the Audit Committee. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Mr. Hai devotes approximately 20 hours per week to our Company. The only conflict that exists is Mr. Hai's devotion of time to other projects. We have no provisions for handling conflicts of interest should they arise in the future; however, Mr. Hai has agreed not to engage in any business activity which conflicts with our activities. 18 <PAGE> EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table sets forth the compensation paid by us from inception on October 29, 2009, through February 28, 2010, for our sole officer and director.

Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

Under Rule 144, since Mr. Hai is an affiliate as defined in that rule, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale, commencing one year after their acquisition. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering. There is no public trading market for our common stock. There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, our common stock. There is one holder of record for our common stock. The record holder is our sole officer and director and he owns 4,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Swordfish Ventures Inc. ( A Development Stage Company) as of February 28, 2010 and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the period from October 29,2009 ( inception) to February 28, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Swordfish Ventures Inc. as of February 28, 2010 and the results of their operations and its cash flows for the aforementioned period in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company's results of operations and lack of capital and liquidity raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. FINAL DRAFT 03/03/2010 ------------------ Stan J.H.

(A Development Stage Company) Notes to the Financial Statements February 28, 2010 NOTE 1 Nature and Continuance of Operations The Company is a development stage company, which was incorporated on October 29, 2009 in the state of Nevada. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The company has yet to achieve profitable operations and losses are anticipated in the development of its business, raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management plans to continue to provide for its working capital needs by seeking loans from its shareholders. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Companys year-end is February 28. NOTE 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates, which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates. The financial statements have, in management's opinion, been properly prepared within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below: Development Stage Company The Company complies with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 7 and the Securities and Exchange Commission Exchange Act 7 for its characterization of the Company as development stage. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long- lived Assets". Under SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment charge is recognized or the amount, if any, which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value. Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments consisting of cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. Income Taxes The Company uses the assets and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes". Under this method, deferred tax assts and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share In accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share', the basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed similar to basic net loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As at February 28, 2010, diluted net loss per share is equivalent to basic net loss per share. Stock Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock options and similar equity instruments issued in accordance with SFAS No. 123(revised), " Share-Based Payment". Accordingly, compensation costs attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the expected vesting period. Transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. SFAS No. 123(revised) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. The Company did not grant any stock options during the period ended February 28, 2010. Comprehensive Income The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 (SFAS 130), Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. The Company is disclosing this information on its Statement of Stockholders' Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has no elements of "other comprehensive income" during the period ended February 28, 2010. New Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES At February 28, 2010, the Company had a federal operating loss carryforward of $5,367 which begins to expire in 2030. Components of net deferred tax assets, including a valuation allowance, are as follows at February 28, 2010. 2010 Deferred tax assets: $ 1,878 Net operating loss carryforward $ -0- 1,878 Less: Valuation Allowance (1,878) $ -0- =============== The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2010 was $ 1,878. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of February 28, 2010, and recorded a full valuation allowance . Reconciliation between the statutory rate and the effective tax rate for the period ended February 28, 2010 is as follows: 2010 Federal statutory tax rate (35.0)% Change in valuation allowance 35.0% Effective tax rate 0.0% ================= NOTE 4- Capital Stock On October 29, 2009, the Company issued 4,000,000 common shares in exchange to the sole officer and director of the Company in exchange for his services to the Company. As of February 28, 2010, the Company is authorized to issue one stock of common stock up to 75,000,000 shares at $ 0.001 par value and 4,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding.

(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
