We refer to the senior notes as those notes, debentures and medium-term notes issued under the indenture, dated as of December 16, 1993, as amended or supplemented, to the second lien notes as those notes issued under, collectively, the indenture dated as of November 17, 2006 and the indenture dated as of February 19, 2009, each as amended or supplemented, to the first lien notes as those notes issued under the indenture, dated as of April 22, 2009, as amended or supplemented, and to the senior secured notes as, collectively, the second lien notes and the first lien notes. We refer to the notes as, collectively, the senior notes and the senior secured notes. For a more detailed description of the notes and the indentures and agreements governing such notes, see Description of Notes. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations. Since completing our recapitalization in November 2006 we are highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2009 our total indebtedness was $26.567 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:  increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;  requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;  limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and  limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. 6 Table of Contents We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. As of March 31, 2009, our substantial indebtedness included $13.356 billion of indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities that matures in 2012 and 2013, $6.000 billion of second lien notes maturing in 2014, 2016 and 2017 and $6.826 billion of unsecured senior notes and debentures that mature on various dates from 2009 to 2095 (including $5.437 billion maturing through 2016). Because a significant portion of our indebtedness matures in the next few years, we may find it necessary or prudent to refinance that indebtedness with longer-maturity debt at a higher interest rate. In April 2009, for example, we issued $1.500 billion of 8 1 / 2 % Senior Secured Notes due 2019. We used the net proceeds of that offering to prepay term loans under our cash flow credit facility, which currently bears interest at a lower floating rate. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the current global economic and financial crisis. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which may enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;  pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;  make certain investments;  sell or transfer assets;  create liens;  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a 7 Table of Contents blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to cash collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder. Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both our cash flow credit facility and our asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior secured credit facilities. If any of the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior secured credit facilities and the notes. Risks Related to the Notes Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no assurance that any active trading market for the notes exists or will continue. We do not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on a securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of markets that may develop for the notes, your ability to sell the notes or the price at which you would be able to sell the notes. No financial institution is obligated to make a market in any of the notes, and any financial institutions that do so may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for any of the notes, if developed, may not continue. Because Banc of America Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and their respective affiliates (collectively, the market makers) may be considered affiliates of ours, they are required to deliver a current market-maker prospectus in connection with any secondary market sale of the notes, which may affect their ability to continue market-making activities. Historically, the market for non investment-grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for any of the notes may not be free from similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, the notes may trade at a discount from your purchase price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. If we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the notes. Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our senior secured credit facilities that is not waived by the required lenders or a default under any of the indentures governing the notes, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes and substantially decrease the market value of the notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including covenants in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the notes), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our senior secured credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If 8 Table of Contents this occurs, we would be in default under the instruments governing that indebtedness, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes, and with respect to the senior secured notes, the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes. Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and, with respect to the senior secured notes, the incurrence of the guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or guarantees could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (1) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, issued the notes or incurred the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the guarantees and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:  we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees;  the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business;  we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such guarantors ability to pay as they mature; or  we were or any of the guarantors was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us or such guarantor if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment was unsatisfied. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of any guarantee were a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A debtor will generally not be considered to have received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the issuance of the guarantees would not be further subordinated to our or any of our guarantors other debt. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:  the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;  the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or  it could not pay its debts as they become due. 9 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Senior Notes The senior notes are unsecured and effectively junior to our secured indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities and our senior secured notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. Our obligations under our senior notes are unsecured and are effectively junior to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. Our senior secured credit facilities and our senior secured notes are collateralized by, among other things, the capital stock of any wholly owned first-tier subsidiary of our company or of any U.S. subsidiary guarantor, substantially all of our and the U.S. subsidiary guarantors other tangible and intangible assets and accounts receivable of our company and certain of our domestic subsidiaries, subject to exceptions. Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior secured notes also permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness. The senior notes are effectively subordinated to all such secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of that collateral. If an event of default occurs under the senior secured credit facilities or under the indentures governing our senior secured notes, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of the holders of our senior notes, even if we are in default with respect to such notes. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them (including all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities and the senior secured notes), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the senior notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the senior notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as such notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the senior notes. As a result, holders of such notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness. As of March 31, 2009, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to our offering of $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien notes in April 2009 and the use of proceeds therefrom, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $19.855 billion of senior secured indebtedness. This senior secured indebtedness includes that outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, including letters of credit, the senior secured notes, capital leases and other secured debt. We also had an additional $2.198 billion available for borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facilities after giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit. Claims of holders of our senior notes will be structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of all of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee such notes. The senior notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, claims of holders of the senior notes are structurally subordinate to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. All obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to holders of the senior notes. In addition, the indentures governing the notes permit, subject to some limitations, these subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and do not contain limitations on the amount of certain other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes The value of the collateral securing the senior secured notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under such notes. No appraisal of the value of the collateral was made in connection with the offerings of each series of senior secured notes, and the fair market value of the collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a 10 Table of Contents sale of the collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, portions of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of this collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the senior secured notes. To the extent that liens securing obligations under the senior secured credit facilities, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the indentures governing the senior secured notes and other rights, including liens on excluded assets, such as those securing purchase money obligations and capital lease obligations granted to other parties (in addition to the holders of any other obligations secured by higher-priority liens), encumber any of the collateral securing the senior secured notes and the guarantees, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the collateral that could adversely affect the value of the collateral and the ability of the collateral agents, the trustees or the holders of the senior secured notes to realize or foreclose on the collateral. In addition, the senior secured notes and the related guarantees are not secured by any of the European collateral described under Description of Other Indebtedness  Senior Secured Credit Facilities  Guarantee and Security. There may not be sufficient collateral to pay off all amounts we may borrow under our senior secured credit facilities, the existing senior secured notes and additional notes that we may offer that would be secured on the same basis as the existing senior secured notes. Consequently, liquidating the collateral securing the senior secured notes may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under such notes after also satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with prior liens. In addition, we may be required to repay obligations under our cash flow credit facility with proceeds from a sale of assets before repaying the senior secured notes. If the proceeds of any sale of collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the senior secured notes, the holders of such notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against our and the subsidiary guarantors remaining assets. Claims of holders of our senior secured notes are structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and some of our U.S. subsidiaries because they do not guarantee such notes. The senior secured notes are not guaranteed by any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, our less than wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries or certain other U.S. subsidiaries. Accordingly, claims of holders of the senior secured notes are structurally subordinate to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. All obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the senior secured notes. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to our offering of $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien notes in April 2009 and the use of proceeds therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for approximately $11.867 billion, or 41.8%, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.038 billion, or 40.9%, of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2009, approximately $9.876 billion, or 40.7%, of our total assets, and approximately $7.517 billion, or 22.5%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2008, and approximately $9.817 billion, or 40.4%, of our total assets, and approximately $7.224 billion, or 21.9%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of March 31, 2009. There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the senior secured notes under which the collateral securing such notes and guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the applicable trustee. Under various circumstances, collateral securing the senior secured notes will be released automatically, including:  a sale, transfer or other disposal of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the indentures governing the senior secured notes;  with respect to collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee; 11 Table of Contents  with respect to collateral that is capital stock, upon the dissolution of the issuer of such capital stock in accordance with the indentures governing the senior secured notes;  with respect to any collateral in which the second lien notes have a second-priority or third-priority lien, upon any release by the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities of their first-priority or second-priority security interest in such collateral unless such release occurs in connection with a discharge in full in cash of first lien obligations, which discharge is not in connection with a foreclosure of, or other exercise of remedies with respect to, non-receivables collateral by the first lien secured parties (such discharge not in connection with any such foreclosure or exercise of remedies, a Payment Discharge); provided that, in the case of a Payment Discharge, the lien on any non-receivables collateral disposed of in satisfaction in whole or in part of first lien obligations shall be automatically released but any proceeds thereof not used for purposes of the discharge of first lien obligations in full in cash or otherwise in accordance with the indentures governing the second lien notes shall be subject to a lien in favor of the collateral agent for the second lien noteholders;  with respect to any receivables collateral in which the first lien notes have a second-priority lien, upon any release by the lenders under our asset-based revolving credit facility of their first-priority security interest in such collateral; provided that, if the release occurs in connection with a foreclosure or exercise of remedies by the collateral agent for the lenders under our asset-based revolving credit facility, the lien on that collateral will be automatically released but any proceeds thereof not used to repay the obligations under our asset-based revolving credit facility will be subject to lien in favor of the collateral agent for the first lien noteholders and our cash flow credit facility; and  with respect to the collateral upon which the first notes have a first-priority lien, upon any release in connection with a foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to that collateral directed by the authorized representative of the lenders under our cash flow credit facility during any period that such authorized representative controls actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the first lien intercreditor agreement. Even though the holders of the notes share ratably with the lenders under our cash flow credit facility, the authorized representative of the lenders under our cash flow credit facility will initially control actions with respect to the collateral, whether or not the holders of the first lien notes agree or disagree with those actions. See  Risks Related to the First Lien Senior Secured Notes  Even though the holders of the first lien notes have the benefit of a first-priority lien on the collateral that secures our cash flow credit facility, the representative of the lenders under the cash flow credit facility will initially control most actions with respect to that collateral. In addition, the guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released to the extent it is released under the senior secured credit facilities or in connection with a sale of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indentures. The indentures governing the senior secured notes also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the senior secured notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indentures governing the senior secured notes, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indentures but not necessarily under our senior secured credit facilities. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries. See Description of Notes. We will in most cases have control over the collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the pool of assets securing the senior secured notes and the guarantees. The collateral documents allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing the senior secured notes and the 12 Table of Contents guarantees, except, under certain circumstances, cash transferred to accounts controlled by the administrative agent under our asset-based revolving credit facility. In addition, we are not required to comply with all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the Trust Indenture Act) if we determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that, under the terms of that Section and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff, including no action letters or exemptive orders, all or such portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act is inapplicable to the released collateral. For example, so long as no default or event of default under the indentures governing the senior secured notes would result therefrom and such transaction would not violate the Trust Indenture Act, we may, among other things, without any release or consent by the applicable trustees, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of collateral and making ordinary course cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). See Description of Notes. The imposition of certain permitted liens will cause the assets on which such liens are imposed to be excluded from the collateral securing the senior secured notes and the guarantees. There are also certain other categories of property that are also excluded from the collateral. The indentures governing the senior secured notes permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional debt, including purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and any assets subject to such liens will be automatically excluded from the collateral securing the senior secured notes and the guarantees. Our ability to incur purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations is subject to the limitations as described in Description of Notes. In addition, certain categories of assets are excluded from the collateral securing the senior secured notes and the guarantees. Excluded assets include the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and equity investees, certain capital stock and other securities of our subsidiaries and equity investees, certain properties that do not secure our senior secured credit facilities, deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts, cash, leaseholds and motor vehicles, and the proceeds from any of the foregoing. The assets excluded from the collateral for the second lien secured notes include the properties defined as principal properties under our indenture dated as of December 16, 1993, so long as that indenture remains in effect. Although the first lien secured notes share a lien on such principal properties, that lien is limited to securing a portion of the indebtedness under the senior secured notes and our cash flow credit facility that, in the aggregate, does not exceed 10% of our consolidated net tangible assets. See Description of Notes. If an event of default occurs and the senior secured notes are accelerated, such notes and the guarantees will rank equally with the holders of other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the relevant entity with respect to such excluded property. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to our offering of $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien notes in April 2009 and the use of proceeds therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for approximately $9.817 billion, or 40.4%, of our total assets as of March 31, 2009. The pledge of the capital stock, other securities and similar items of our subsidiaries that secure the senior secured notes will automatically be released from the lien on them and no longer constitute collateral for so long as the pledge of such capital stock or such other securities would require the filing of separate financial statements with the SEC for that subsidiary. The senior secured notes and the guarantees are secured by a pledge of the stock of some of our subsidiaries. Under the SEC regulations in effect as of the issue date of the senior secured notes, if the par value, book value as carried by us or market value (whichever is greatest) of the capital stock, other securities or similar items of a subsidiary pledged as part of the collateral is greater than or equal to 20% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes then outstanding, such a subsidiary would be required to provide separate financial statements to the SEC. Therefore, the indentures governing the senior secured notes and the collateral documents provide that any capital stock and other securities of any of our subsidiaries will be excluded from the collateral for so long as the pledge of such capital stock or other securities to secure the senior secured notes would cause such subsidiary to be required to file separate financial statements with the SEC pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X (as in effect from time to time). 13 Table of Contents As a result, holders of the senior secured notes could lose a portion or all of their security interest in the capital stock or other securities of those subsidiaries during such period. It may be more difficult, costly and time-consuming for holders of the senior secured notes to foreclose on the assets of a subsidiary than to foreclose on its capital stock or other securities, so the proceeds realized upon any such foreclosure could be significantly less than those that would have been received upon any sale of the capital stock or other securities of such subsidiary. See Description of Notes. Your rights in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in certain collateral in the future. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The trustees or the collateral agents for the senior secured notes may not monitor, or we may not inform the trustees or the collateral agents for the senior secured notes of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The collateral agents for the senior secured notes have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the senior secured notes against third parties. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in favor of the senior secured notes against third parties. The collateral is subject to casualty risks. We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the pledged collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the senior secured notes and the guarantees. We may not be able to repurchase the senior secured notes upon a change of control. Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior secured notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for any such purchase of such notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the senior secured notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the senior secured notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Further, we are contractually restricted under the terms of our senior secured credit facilities from repurchasing all of the notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase the senior secured notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under the instruments governing that indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the senior secured notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indentures governing the senior secured notes and a cross-default under the instruments governing our senior secured credit facilities. The instruments governing our senior secured credit facilities also provide that a change of control will be a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. In the event of our bankruptcy, the ability of the holders of the senior secured notes to realize upon the collateral will be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations. The ability of holders of the senior secured notes to realize upon the collateral will be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of our bankruptcy. Under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws, secured creditors are prohibited from repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case without bankruptcy court approval and may be prohibited from disposing of security repossessed from such a debtor without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally permit the debtor 14 Table of Contents to continue to retain collateral, including cash collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given adequate protection. The meaning of the term adequate protection may vary according to the circumstances, but is intended generally to protect the value of the secured creditors interest in the collateral at the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security if and at such times as the court, in its discretion, determines that a diminution in the value of the collateral occurs as a result of the stay of repossession or the disposition of the collateral during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term adequate protection and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, we cannot predict whether or when the collateral agents and/or the trustees under the indentures which govern senior secured notes could foreclose upon or sell the collateral or whether or to what extent holders of senior secured notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of adequate protection. Moreover, the collateral agents for the senior secured notes may need to evaluate the impact of the potential liabilities before determining to foreclose on collateral consisting of real property, if any, because secured creditors that hold a security interest in real property may be held liable under environmental laws for the costs of remediating or preventing the release or threatened releases of hazardous substances at such real property. Consequently, the collateral agents for the senior secured notes may decline to foreclose on such collateral or exercise remedies available in respect thereof if they do not receive indemnification to their satisfaction from the holders of the senior secured notes. Certain series of senior secured notes were issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The 9 5 / 8 %/10 3 / 8 % senior secured toggle notes due 2016, the 9 7 / 8 % senior secured notes due 2017 and the 8 1 / 2 % senior secured notes due 2019 (collectively, the OID Notes) were issued with original issue discount (OID) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, in addition to stated interest on the OID Notes, U.S. holders (as defined in Certain U.S. Federal Tax Consequences) will be required to include amounts representing the OID in gross income on a constant yield to maturity basis in advance of the receipt of cash payment thereof, regardless of a U.S. holders method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. With respect to the 9 5 / 8 %/10 3 / 8 % senior secured toggle notes due 2016, U.S. holders will be required to include such OID in gross income even if we do not pay cash interest. For more information about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning the OID Notes, see Certain U.S. Federal Tax Consequences. If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, holders of the OID Notes may receive a lesser amount for their claim than they would have been entitled to receive under the indenture governing such notes. If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the OID Notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount of the notes may be limited to an amount equal to the sum of:  the original issue price for such notes; and  that portion of the original issue discount that does not constitute unmatured interest for purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Any original issue discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute unmatured interest. Accordingly, holders of the OID Notes under these circumstances may receive a lesser amount than they would be entitled to receive under the terms of the indenture governing such notes, even if sufficient funds are available. 15 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Second Lien Senior Secured Notes Other secured indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities and first lien notes, is effectively senior to the second lien notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness on a higher priority basis. Our cash flow credit facility and our first lien notes are collateralized by a first-priority lien, subject to permitted liens, in, among other things, the capital stock of any wholly owned first-tier subsidiary of our company or of any U.S. subsidiary guarantor and substantially all of our and the U.S. subsidiary guarantors other tangible and intangible assets, subject to exceptions. In addition, our asset-based revolving credit facility has a first-priority lien in the accounts receivable of our company and certain of our subsidiaries, and our first lien notes and our cash flow credit facility, other than the European term loan facility, have a second-priority lien in those receivables (except for those of certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our asset-based revolving credit facility). Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior secured notes also permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured on a first-priority basis by such assets in the future. The first- and second-priority liens in the collateral securing indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and our first lien notes, as the case may be, and any such future indebtedness is higher in priority as to such collateral than the security interests securing the second lien notes and the guarantees of such notes. The second lien notes and the related guarantees are secured, subject to permitted liens, by a second-priority lien or a third-priority lien, as the case may be, in the assets that secure our cash flow credit facility and first lien notes on a first-priority or second-priority basis, as the case may be. Holders of the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and any other indebtedness collateralized by a higher-priority lien in such collateral will be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of such collateral to repay such indebtedness in full before the holders of the second lien notes will be entitled to any recovery from such collateral. As a result, holders of the second lien notes will only be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of assets securing our senior secured credit facilities and first lien notes on a higher-priority basis after all indebtedness and other obligations under our senior secured credit facilities, first lien notes and any other obligations secured by higher-priority liens on such assets are repaid in full. The second lien notes are effectively junior in right of payment to indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and any other indebtedness collateralized by a higher-priority lien in our assets, to the extent of the realizable value of such collateral. In addition, the indentures governing the second lien notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured by a lien that ranks equally with the second lien notes. Any such indebtedness may further limit the recovery from the realization of the value of such collateral available to satisfy holders of the second lien notes. As of March 31, 2009, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to our offering of $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien notes in April 2009 and the use of proceeds therefrom, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $13.855 billion of senior secured indebtedness secured by liens ranking senior to those securing the second lien notes. This indebtedness includes that outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, including letters of credit, the first lien notes, capital leases and other debt secured on a first priority basis. We also had an additional $2.198 billion available for borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facilities after giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit. The lien ranking provisions of the indentures and other agreements relating to the collateral securing the second lien notes limit the rights of holders of such notes with respect to that collateral, even during an event of default. The rights of the holders of the second lien notes with respect to the collateral that secures the notes on a second-priority or third-priority basis, as the case may be, are substantially limited by the terms of the lien ranking agreements set forth in the indentures and the intercreditor agreements, even during an event of default. Under the indentures and the intercreditor agreements, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the higher-priority liens are outstanding, any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral and to control the conduct of such proceedings, and the approval of amendments to, releases of such collateral from the lien of, and waivers of past defaults under, such documents relating to such collateral, will be at the 16 Table of Contents direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first-priority and second-priority liens, as applicable, and the holders of the notes secured by lower-priority liens may be adversely affected. In addition, the indentures and the intercreditor agreements contain certain provisions benefiting holders of indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, including provisions requiring the second lien trustees and the second lien collateral agent not to object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a number of important matters regarding the collateral. After such filing, the value of this collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the second lien notes would be unable to raise an objection. In addition, the right of holders of obligations secured by first-priority and second-priority liens, as applicable, to foreclose upon and sell such collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default also would be subject to limitations under applicable bankruptcy laws if we or any of our subsidiaries become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. The collateral that secures the second lien notes and guarantees on a lower-priority basis will also be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities, the holders of our first lien notes and other creditors that have the benefit of higher-priority liens on such collateral from time to time, whether on or after the date the second lien notes and guarantees are issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the second lien notes as well as the ability of the second lien collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. The lenders under our senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantors under the instruments governing that indebtedness in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the second lien notes. While any obligations under our senior secured credit facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee of the second lien notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the second lien notes or the trustees under the indentures governing the second lien notes, at the discretion of lenders under our senior secured credit facilities, if the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under that indebtedness or any other indebtedness. See Description of Notes. The lenders under our senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the second lien notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of holders of such notes. Risks Related to the First Lien Senior Secured Notes The secured indebtedness under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility is effectively senior to the first lien notes to the extent of the value of the receivables collateral securing such facility on a first-priority basis. Our asset-based revolving credit facility has a first-priority lien in the accounts receivable of our company and our domestic subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. Our other senior secured credit facilities have, and our first lien notes have, a second-priority lien in those receivables (except for those of certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our asset-based revolving credit facility). The indentures governing both the second lien notes and the first lien notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured on a first-priority basis by such assets in the future. The first-priority liens in the collateral securing indebtedness under our asset-based revolving credit facility and any such future indebtedness is higher in priority as to such collateral than the security interests securing the first lien notes and the guarantees. Holders of the indebtedness under our asset-based revolving credit facility and any other indebtedness secured by higher priority liens on such collateral will be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of such collateral to repay such indebtedness in full before the holders of the first lien notes will be entitled to any recovery from such collateral. As a result, holders of the first lien notes will only be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of assets securing our asset-based revolving credit facility on a higher priority basis after all indebtedness and other obligations under our asset-based revolving credit facility and any other obligations secured by higher priority liens on such assets are repaid in full. The 17 Table of Contents first lien notes are effectively junior in right of payment to indebtedness under our asset-based revolving credit facility and any other indebtedness secured by higher priority liens on such collateral to the extent of the realizable value of such collateral. Even if there were receivables collateral or proceeds left over to pay the first lien notes and the cash flow credit facility after a foreclosure on that collateral and payment of the outstanding amounts under the asset-based revolving credit facility, that collateral would be subject to the first lien intercreditor agreement, and the representative of the lenders under the cash flow credit facility would initially control actions with respect to that collateral. See  Even though the holders of the first lien notes have the benefit of a first-priority lien on the collateral that secures our cash flow credit facility, the representative of the lenders under the cash flow credit facility will initially control actions with respect to that collateral. As of March 31, 2009, the first lien notes would have been effectively junior to $1.715 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our asset-based revolving credit facility to the extent of the value of collateral securing such indebtedness. The lien ranking provisions of the indenture and other agreements relating to the collateral securing the first lien notes limit the rights of holders of the first lien notes with respect to that collateral, even during an event of default. The rights of the holders of the first lien notes with respect to the receivables collateral that secures the asset-based revolving credit facility on a first-priority basis and that secures our cash flow credit facility and the first lien notes on a second-priority basis are substantially limited by the terms of the lien ranking agreements set forth in the indenture governing the first lien notes and the applicable receivables intercreditor agreement, even during an event of default. Under the indenture governing the first lien notes and the applicable receivables intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the higher priority liens are outstanding, any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral, to control the conduct of such proceedings and to approve amendments to releases of such collateral from the lien of, and waive past defaults under, such documents relating to such collateral, will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first-priority liens, and the holders of the first lien notes secured by lower-priority liens may be adversely affected. In addition, the indenture governing the first lien notes and the applicable receivables intercreditor agreement contain certain provisions benefiting holders of indebtedness under our asset-based revolving credit facility, including provisions requiring the trustee and the collateral agent for the first lien notes not to object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to certain important matters regarding the receivables collateral. After such filing, the value of this collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the first lien notes would be unable to raise an objection. The receivables collateral that secures the first lien notes and guarantees on a lower-priority basis will also be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the lenders under our asset-based revolving credit facility, whether on or after the date the first lien notes and guarantees were issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the first lien notes, as well as the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. Even though the holders of the first lien notes have the benefit of a first-priority lien on the collateral that secures our cash flow credit facility, the representative of the lenders under the cash flow credit facility will initially control actions with respect to that collateral. The rights of the holders of the first lien notes with respect to the collateral that secures such notes on a first-priority basis are subject to a first lien intercreditor agreement among all holders of obligations secured by that collateral on a first-priority basis, including the obligations under our cash flow credit facility. Under that intercreditor agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral, to control such proceedings 18 Table of Contents and to approve amendments to releases of such collateral from the lien of, and waive past defaults under, such documents relating to such collateral, will be at the direction of the authorized representative of the lenders under the cash flow credit facility until (1) our obligations under the cash flow credit facility are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the cash flow credit facility) or (2) 90 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the first lien notes, if the authorized representative of the holders of the first lien notes represents the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral (other than the cash flow credit facility) and has complied with the applicable notice provisions. However, even if the authorized representative of the first lien notes gains the right to direct the collateral agent in the circumstances described in clause (2) above, the authorized representative must stop doing so (and those powers with respect to the collateral would revert to the authorized representative of the lenders under the cash flow credit facility) if the lenders authorized representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing enforcement action with respect to the collateral or the grantor of the security interest in that collateral (whether our company or the applicable subsidiary guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In addition, the senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the first lien notes permit us to issue additional series of notes that also have a first-priority lien on the same collateral. At any time that the representative of the lenders under the cash flow credit facility does not have the right to take actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the first lien intercreditor agreement, that right passes to the authorized representative of the holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral. If we issue additional first lien notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the existing first lien notes, then the authorized representative for those additional notes would be next in line to exercise rights under the first lien intercreditor agreement, rather than the authorized representative for the existing first lien notes. Under the first lien intercreditor agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the first lien notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing or to the use of the shared collateral to secure that financing, subject to conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of this collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the first lien notes would be unable to raise an objection. The collateral that secures the first lien notes and guarantees on a first-priority basis will also be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the authorized representative of the lenders under our cash flow credit facility during any period that such authorized representative controls actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the first lien intercreditor agreement. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the first lien notes as well as the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral for the benefit of the holders of the first lien notes.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from such transactions. 21 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS Senior Secured Credit Facilities On November 17, 2006 in connection with our recapitalization, we entered into the senior secured credit facilities with Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Citicorp North America, Inc., as co-syndication agents and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, as documentation agent. The senior secured credit facilities provide senior secured financing of $16.800 billion, consisting of:  $12.800 billion-equivalent in term loan facilities, comprised of a $2.750 billion senior secured term loan A facility with a term of six years, a $8.800 billion senior secured term loan B facility with a term of seven years and a 1.000 billion ($1.250 billion) senior secured European term loan facility with a term of seven years; and  $4.000 billion in revolving credit facilities, comprised of a $2.000 billion senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility available in dollars with a term of six years and a $2.000 billion senior secured revolving credit facility available in dollars, euros and pounds sterling with a term of six years. Availability under the asset-based revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable less customary reserves. We refer to these senior secured credit facilities, excluding the asset-based revolving credit facility, as the cash flow credit facility and, collectively with the asset-based revolving credit facility, the senior secured credit facilities. HCA Inc. is the primary borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, except that a U.K. subsidiary is the borrower under the European term loan facility. The revolving credit facilities include capacity available for the issuance of letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as the swingline loans. A portion of the letter of credit availability under the cash-flow revolving credit facility is available in euros, dollars and pounds sterling. Lenders under the cash flow credit facility are subject to a loss sharing agreement pursuant to which, upon the occurrence of certain events, including a bankruptcy event of default under the cash flow credit facility, each such lender will automatically be deemed to have exchanged its interest in a particular tranche of the cash flow credit facility for a pro rata percentage in all of the tranches of the cash flow credit facility. The asset-based revolving credit facility is documented in a separate loan agreement from the other senior secured credit facilities. On February 16, 2007, we amended our cash flow credit facility to reduce the applicable margins with respect to the term borrowings thereunder. On June 20, 2007, we amended our asset-based revolving credit facility to reduce the applicable margin with respect to borrowings thereunder. On March 2, 2009, we amended our cash flow credit facility to allow for one or more future issuances of additional secured notes, which may include notes that are secured on a pari passu basis or on a junior basis with the obligations under the cash flow credit facility, so long as (1) such notes do not require, subject to certain exceptions, scheduled repayments, payment of principal or redemption prior to the scheduled term loan B maturity date as currently in effect, (2) the terms of such notes, taken as a whole, are not more restrictive than those in the cash flow credit facility and (3) the proceeds from any such issuance are used within three business days of receipt to permanently prepay term loans under the cash flow credit facility in accordance with the terms of the cash flow credit facility. The U.S. security documents related to the cash flow credit facility were also amended and restated or, in the case of the U.S. mortgages, will be amended and restated, in connection with the amendment in order to give effect to the security interests to be granted to holders of such additional secured notes. On March 2, 2009, we also amended our asset-based revolving credit facility to allow for one or more future issuances of additional secured notes or loans, which may include notes or loans that are secured on a 22 Table of Contents pari passu basis or on a junior basis with the obligations under the cash flow credit facility, so long as (1) such notes or loans do not require, subject to certain exceptions, scheduled repayments, payment of principal or redemption prior to the scheduled term loan B final maturity date as currently in effect, (2) the terms of such notes or loans, as applicable, taken as a whole, are not more restrictive than those in the cash flow credit facility and (3) the proceeds from any such issuance are used within three business days of receipt to permanently prepay term loans under the cash flow credit facility in accordance with the terms of the cash flow credit facility. The amendment to the asset-based revolving credit facility also altered the excess facility availability requirement to include a separate minimum facility availability requirement applicable to the asset-based revolving credit facility and increased the applicable LIBOR and asset-based revolving margins for all borrowings under the asset-based revolving credit facility by 0.25% each. See also our 2008 10-K under Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions for a description of certain relationships between our company and Bank of America, N.A., the administrative agent under the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Interest Rate and Fees Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) LIBOR for deposits in the applicable currency plus an applicable margin or (b) the higher of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins currently in effect for borrowings are (w) under the asset-based revolving credit facility, 0.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 1.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings, (x) under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the term loan B facility, 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings, (y) under the term loan A facility, 1.00% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.00% with respect to LIBOR borrowings and (z) under the European term loan facility, 2.00% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The applicable margins may be reduced or increased depending on our leverage ratios. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior secured credit facilities, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facilities in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The initial commitment fee rate is 0.50% per annum for the revolving credit facility and 0.375% for the asset-based revolving credit facility. Each of these commitment fee rates may be reduced subject to our reducing our leverage to specified ratios. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees. Prepayments The cash flow credit facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:  50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if our total leverage ratio is 5.50x or less and to 0% if our total leverage ratio is 5.00x or less) of our annual excess cash flow;  100% of the net cash proceeds of all nonordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, other than the Receivables Collateral, as defined below, if we do not (1) reinvest or commit to reinvest those proceeds in assets to be used in our business or to make certain other permitted investments within 15 months as long as, in the case of any such commitment to reinvest or make certain other permitted investments, such investment is completed within such 15-month period or, if later, within 180 days after such commitment is made or (2) apply such proceeds within 15 months to repay debt of HCA Inc. that was outstanding on the effective date of the Merger scheduled to mature prior to the earliest final maturity of the senior secured credit facilities then outstanding; and  100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from the receivables facilities and other debt permitted under the senior secured credit facilities. The foregoing mandatory prepayments are applied among the term loan facilities (1) during the first three years after the effective date of the Merger, pro rata to such facilities based on the respective aggregate 23 Table of Contents amounts of unpaid principal installments thereof due during such period, with amounts allocated to each facility being applied to the remaining installments thereof in direct order of maturity and (2) thereafter, pro rata to such facilities, with amounts allocated to each facility being applied, in the case of the term loan A facility, pro rata to the remaining installments thereof and, in the case of the term loan B facility or the European term loan facility, to the next eight unpaid scheduled installments of principal of such facility and then pro rata to the remaining amortization payments under such facility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) proceeds of asset sales by foreign subsidiaries are applied solely to prepay European term loans until such term loans have been repaid in full and (ii) we are not required to prepay loans under the term loan A facility or the term loan B facility with net cash proceeds of asset sales or with excess cash flow, in each case attributable to foreign subsidiaries, to the extent that the repatriation of such amounts is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law or would result in material adverse tax consequences. The asset-based revolving credit facility requires us to prepay outstanding loans if borrowings exceed the borrowing base. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the senior secured credit facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBOR loans. Amortization We are required to repay the loans under the term loan facilities as follows:  the term loan A facility amortizes in quarterly installments such that the aggregate amount of the original funded principal amount of such facility repaid pursuant to such amortization payments in each year, commencing with the year ending December 31, 2007, is equal to $112.5 million in years 1 and 2, $225 million in years 3 and 4, $450 million in year 5 and $1.625 billion in year 6; and  each of the term loan B facility and the European term loan facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments that commenced on March 31, 2007 in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1% of the original funded principal amount of such facility, with the balance being payable on the final maturity date of such term loans. Principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facilities are due and payable in full at maturity, six years from the date of the closing of the senior secured credit facilities. Guarantee and Security All obligations under the senior secured credit facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries that are Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the 1993 Indenture (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under the asset-based revolving credit facility), and the obligations under the European term loan facility are also unconditionally guaranteed by HCA Inc. and each of our existing and future wholly owned material subsidiaries formed under the laws of England and Wales, subject, in each of the foregoing cases, to any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual constraints and to the requirement that such guarantee does not cause adverse tax consequences. All obligations under the asset-based revolving credit facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the receivables of the borrowers and each guarantor under such asset-based revolving credit facility (the Receivables Collateral). All obligations under the cash flow credit facility and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by:  a first-priority lien on the capital stock owned by HCA Inc. or by any U.S. guarantor in each of their respective first-tier subsidiaries (limited, in the case of foreign subsidiaries, to 65% of the voting stock of such subsidiaries); 24 Table of Contents  a first-priority lien on substantially all present and future assets of HCA Inc. and of each U.S. guarantor other than (i) Principal Properties (as defined in the 1993 Indenture), except for certain Principal Properties the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured thereby in respect of the cash flow credit facility and the notes offered hereby and any future First Lien Obligations, taken as a whole, do not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined under the 1993 Indenture), (ii) certain other real properties and (iii) deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts, cash, leaseholds, motor-vehicles and certain other exceptions (such collateral under this and the preceding bullet, the Non-Receivables Collateral); and  a second-priority lien on certain of the Receivables Collateral (such portion of the Receivables Collateral, the Shared Receivables Collateral; the Receivables Collateral that does not secure such cash flow credit facility on a second-priority basis is referred to as the Separate Receivables Collateral).

Following that summary, specific securities and relevant terms are listed, divided into two categories of debt securities issued: (a) notes and debentures and (b) medium-term notes.

Ranking The debt securities are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to any of our existing and future senior indebtedness, are senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness, are effectively subordinated in right of payment to our secured obligations to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the debt securities. In a liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, the right of holders of the debt securities to participate in any distribution is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that we are a creditor. Limitations on Us and Our Subsidiaries Limitation on Mortgages The Indenture provides that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will issue, assume or guarantee any indebtedness or obligation secured by mortgages, liens, pledges or other encumbrances (referred to collectively as mortgages) upon any principal property (as defined below under   Certain Definitions), unless the debt securities shall be secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) such debt. This restriction will not apply to:  mortgages securing the purchase price or cost of construction of property or additions, substantial repairs, alterations or improvements, if the debt and the mortgages are incurred within 18 months of the acquisition or completion of construction and full operation or additions, repairs, alterations or improvements;  mortgages existing on property at the time of its acquisition by us or our subsidiary or on the property of a corporation at the time of the acquisition of such corporation by us or our subsidiary;  mortgages to secure debt on which the interest payments are exempt from federal income tax under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code;  mortgages in favor of us or a consolidated subsidiary; 28 Table of Contents  mortgages existing on the date of the Indenture;  certain mortgages to governmental entities;  mortgages incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds used to repay debt within 120 days in the same principal amount secured by other mortgages on principal property with at least the same appraised fair market value;  mortgages incurred within 90 days (or any longer period, not in excess of one year, as permitted by law) after acquisition of the related property or equipment arising solely in connection with the transfer of tax benefits in accordance with Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code; and  any extension, renewal or replacement of any mortgage referred to above, provided the amount secured is not increased and it relates to the same property. Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions The Indenture provides that neither we nor any subsidiary will enter into any sale and lease-back transaction with respect to any principal property involving a lease of more than three years with another person (other than our company or a subsidiary) unless either:  we or our subsidiary could incur indebtedness secured by a mortgage on the property to be leased; or  within 120 days, we apply the greater of the net proceeds of the sale of the leased property or the fair value of the leased property, as determined by our chief financial officer (less the principal amount of any debt securities delivered within 120 days for retirement or cancellation or other funded debt voluntarily retired within 120 days) to the voluntary retirement of our long-term funded debt or the acquisition or construction of a principal property. Limitation on Subsidiary Debt and Preferred Stock The Indenture provides that none of our restricted subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume or otherwise become liable with respect to, extend the maturity of, or become responsible for the payment of, any debt or preferred stock except:  debt outstanding on the date of the Indenture; or  debt representing the assumption by one restricted subsidiary of debt of another;  debt or preferred stock of any corporation or partnership existing when it becomes a subsidiary;  debt of a restricted subsidiary arising from agreements providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations or from guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds or performance bonds securing any of our obligations or those of our subsidiaries incurred or assumed in connection with the disposition of any business, property or subsidiary, except for the purpose of financing an acquisition, provided that the maximum aggregate liability does not exceed the gross proceeds from the disposition;  debt of a restricted subsidiary in respect of performance, surety and other similar bonds, bankers acceptances and letters of credit provided in the ordinary course of business;  debt secured by a mortgage incurred to finance the purchase price or cost of construction of property or additions, substantial repairs, alterations or improvements, if the mortgage and debt are incurred within 18 months of the later of the acquisition or completion of construction and full operation or additions, repairs, alterations or improvements and the mortgage does not relate to any other property;  permitted subsidiary refinancing debt (as defined below under  Certain Definitions);  debt, including guarantees, of a restricted subsidiary to us or another subsidiary as long as we hold it; or  any obligation pursuant to a permitted sale and lease-back transaction. 29 Table of Contents Exempted Transactions Even if otherwise prohibited by these limitations, if the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all our other debt and that of our subsidiaries subject to these limitations does not exceed 15% of our consolidated net tangible assets, then:  we or any of our subsidiaries may issue, assume or guarantee debt secured by mortgages;  we or any of our subsidiaries may enter into any sale and lease-back transaction; and  any restricted subsidiary may issue, assume or become liable for any debt or preferred stock. Events of Default Under the Indenture, an event of default applicable to the debt securities of any series means:  failure to pay the principal or any premium on any debt securities of that series when due;  failure to pay any interest on any debt securities of that series when due, continued for 30 days;  failure to deposit any sinking fund payment in respect of any debt securities of that series when due;  failure to perform, or the breach of, any of our other applicable covenants or warranties in the Indenture, continued for 60 days after written notice;  events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; and  any other event of default provided with respect to debt securities of that series. If any event of default with respect to debt securities of any series occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount, or in the case of discount securities, the applicable portion of the principal amount, of all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. The holders may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul this acceleration prior to obtaining a judgment or decree. Other than the duties of the Trustee during a default to act with the required standard of care, the Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity. Subject to these indemnification provisions and certain other conditions described in the Indenture, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the debt securities of that series. We will furnish the Trustee annually with a statement as to our performance of our obligations under the Indenture and as to any default in our performance. Modification and Waiver We and the Trustee may modify and amend the Indenture with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected voting separately. We must have the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security affected to:  change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, any debt security;  reduce the principal, premium or interest on any debt security;  reduce the amount of principal of discount securities payable upon acceleration of the maturity;  change the currency of payment of principal, premium or interest on any debt security;  impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to any debt securities; or 30 Table of Contents  reduce the percentage of holders of any series whose consent is required for modification or amendment of the Indenture or for waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain defaults. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series may, on behalf of all holders of that series, waive any past default under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of that series. However, such holders may not waive a past default in the payment of principal, premium or interest, or any sinking fund installment with respect to the debt securities, or waive a covenant or provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holders of each outstanding debt security affected. We and the Trustee may modify and amend the Indenture without the consent of the holders of the debt securities to, among other things:  evidence the succession of another corporation to our company;  add to the covenants for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon our company;  add additional events of default;  secure the debt securities;  supplement the Indenture to the extent necessary to permit or facilitate defeasance and discharge of any series of debt securities; provided that this action does not adversely affect the holders of debt securities in any material respect;  establish the form and terms of debt securities of any new series;  provide for a successor trustee or for co-trustees;  cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision of the Indenture that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision, or make any other provisions that are not inconsistent with any provision of the Indenture; provided that those other provisions do not adversely affect the interests of the holders of outstanding debt securities of any series in any material respect; or  change any place where principal, premium (if any) and interest is payable, where debt securities may be surrendered for registration, transfer or exchange or where notices or demands on our company may be served. Consolidation, Merger, Sale or Lease of Assets We may consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease our assets substantially as an entirety to any corporation without the consent of the holders of any of the outstanding debt securities under the Indenture if:  the successor corporation is a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state there of or the District of Columbia and expressly assumes our obligations on the debt securities and under the Indenture;  after giving effect to the transaction, no event of default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an event of default, shall have occurred and be continuing;  if, as a result of the transaction, our company would become subject to a mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance that would not be permitted by the Indenture, we or the successor corporation will secure the debt securities equally and ratably with (or prior to) all indebtedness secured thereby; and  we have delivered to the Trustee an officers certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that the transaction complies with the Indenture and that all conditions precedent have been complied with. Defeasance If so specified in the terms of any series of debt securities, we may be discharged from all obligations under the debt securities of any series, and we will not be subject to the limitations in the Indenture discussed in the above sections (known as legal defeasance) or we may cease to be under any obligation to comply with 31 Table of Contents specified covenants in the Indenture (known as covenant defeasance), if (1) we deposit with the Trustee trust money or U.S. government obligations that are sufficient to pay all principal, premium and interest on the debt securities of the series and certain other conditions are met. We would deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the deposit and related defeasance would not (1) cause the holders of the debt securities of the series to recognize income, gain or loss for United States income tax purposes or (2) result in the delisting of the debt securities from any national securities exchange (if so listed). Optional Redemption If the terms of any series of debt securities (other than the £150,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Notes Due 2010, which are discussed below under the heading  Provisions that Apply Only to the £150,000,000 8.75% Senior Notes Due 2010) indicate that they are redeemable at the option of our company, the debt securities of that series will be redeemable, at our option, at any time in whole, or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus the number of basis points specified in the terms of the debt securities. In each case, we will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. We will mail notice of any redemption between 30 and 60 days preceding the redemption date to each holder of the debt securities to be redeemed. The notice of the redemption for such debt securities will state, among other things, the principal amount of the debt securities to be redeemed, the redemption price and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the debt securities to be redeemed. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the debt securities or portions called for redemption.

In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are listed or, if the notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate, although no note of £1,000 in original principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to the note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued and delivered to the Trustee, or its nominee, or, in the case of notes in definitive form, issued in the name of the holder thereof, in each case upon cancellation of the original note. Unless we default in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the notes or portions called for redemption. Tax Redemption of the £150,000,000 8.75% Senior Notes Due 2010 The 2010 Pounds Sterling Notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, together with interest accrued and 34 Table of Contents unpaid to the date fixed for redemption, at any time, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, which notice shall be irrevocable, if:  we have or will become obliged to pay Additional Amounts (as defined under  Additional Amounts below) as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws, regulations or rulings of the United States or any political subdivision or any taxing authority of or in the United States affecting taxation, or any change in or amendment to an official application, interpretation, administration or enforcement of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after November 1, 2000; or  any action shall have been taken by a taxing authority, or any action has been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, in the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States, including any of those actions specified in the first bullet point above, whether or not such action was taken or brought with respect to our company, or any change, clarification, amendment, application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings shall be officially proposed, in any such case, on or after October 25, 2000, which results in a substantial likelihood that we will be required to pay Additional Amounts on the next interest payment date. However, no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which we would be, in the case of a redemption for the reasons specified in the first bullet point above, or there would be a substantial likelihood that we would be, in the case of a redemption for the reasons specified in the second bullet point above, obligated to pay such Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the notes were then due. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this subsection, we will deliver to the Trustee:  a certificate signed by one of our duly authorized officers stating that we are entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right so to redeem have occurred; and  a written opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing to the effect that we have or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of such change or amendment or that there is a substantial likelihood that we will be required to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of such action or proposed change, clarification, amendment, application or interpretation, as the case may be. Such notice, once delivered by us to the Trustee, will be irrevocable. Additional Amounts All payments of principal and interest in respect of the 2010 Pounds Sterling Notes will be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. In the event such withholding or deduction is required by law, subject to the limitations described below, we will pay as additional interest on the notes to the holder or beneficial owner of any note who is a non-U.S. holder (as defined below), such additional amounts (Additional Amounts) as may be necessary in order that every net payment by us or any paying agent of principal of or interest on the notes (including upon redemption), after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States, will not be less than the amount provided for in such note to be then due and payable before any such tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge. 35 Table of Contents However, our obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply to: (a) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been so imposed but for: (1) the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder or other equity owner of, or a person having a power over, such holder or beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, a trust, a limited liability company, a partnership, a corporation or other entity) and the United States, including, without limitation, such holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or other equity owner or person having such a power) being or having been a citizen or resident or treated as a resident of the United States or being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States or being or having been present in the United States or having had a permanent establishment in the United States; (2) the failure of such holder or beneficial owner to comply with any requirement under United States tax laws and regulations to establish entitlement to a partial or complete exemption from such tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge (including, but not limited to, the requirement to provide Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, Forms W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successor thereto); or (3) such holders or beneficial owners present or former status as a personal holding company or a foreign personal holding company with respect to the United States, as a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the United States, as a passive foreign investment company with respect to the United States, as a private foundation or other tax exempt organization with respect to the United States or as a corporation which accumulates earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; (b) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the holder or beneficial owner: (1) owning or having owned, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of HCA Inc.s stock; (2) being a bank receiving interest described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code; or (3) being a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the United States that is related to HCA Inc. by stock ownership; (c) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation by the holder or beneficial owner of such note for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment of the note is duly provided for and notice is given to holders, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that the holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to such additional amounts on presenting such note on any date during such 30-day period; (d) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property, wealth, interest equalization or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (e) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payment of principal of or interest on such note; (f) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable by a holder that is not the beneficial owner of the note, or a portion of the note, or that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other similar entity, but only to the extent that a beneficial owner, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or member of such partnership, limited liability company or similar entity would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had such beneficial owner, settlor, beneficiary or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment; 36 Table of Contents (g) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on any note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent; or (h) any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g). For purposes of this subsection, the holding of or the receipt of any payment with respect to a note will not constitute a connection (1) between the holder or beneficial owner and the United States or (2) between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder or other equity owner of, or a person having a power over, such holder or beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, a trust, a limited liability company, a partnership, a corporation or other entity, and the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. Any reference in this prospectus, in the Indenture or in the notes to principal or interest with respect to the 2010 Pounds Sterling Notes shall be deemed to refer also to Additional Amounts which may be payable under the provisions of this subsection. We will pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein with respect to the issuance of the notes. Except as specifically provided in the notes, we will not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States. Unless previously redeemed or repurchased and cancelled, the notes will be payable at par, including Additional Amounts, if any, on November 1, 2010 or such earlier date on which the applicable notes shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable notes. However, if the maturity date of the applicable notes is not a Business Day, the notes will be payable on the next succeeding business day and no interest shall accrue for the period from the maturity date to such payment date. For purposes of the 2010 Pounds Sterling Notes, a non-U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of the notes that is not a U.S. holder. A U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of the notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:  a United States citizen or resident alien individual;  a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof (including the District of Columbia);  an estate if its income is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  a trust (1) that validly elects to be treated as a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes or (2)(a) the administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the substantial decisions of which one or more United States persons has the authority to control. Issuance of Additional Debt Securities If the terms of any series of debt securities so indicate, we may, without the consent of the holders of that series of debt securities, increase the principal amount of the debt securities of that series by issuing additional debt securities in the future on the same terms and conditions, except for any differences in the issue price and interest accrued prior to the issue date of the additional debt securities, and with the same CUSIP number as existing debt securities of that series. The existing debt securities of that series and any additional debt securities of that series would rank equally and ratably for all purposes under the Indenture.

Brief Description of Notes The Notes are:  general senior obligations of the Issuer;  secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under any future Junior Lien Obligations, by all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors which are not Principal Properties and which secure the General Credit Facility (other than the European Collateral), subject to the Liens securing the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the General Credit Facility and any other Priority Lien Obligations and other Permitted Liens; 43 Table of Contents  secured on a third-priority basis, equally and ratably with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under any future Junior Lien Obligations, by all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors securing the ABL Facility which also secure the General Credit Facility, subject to the Liens securing the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and any other Priority Lien Obligations and other Permitted Liens;  effectively subordinated, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness (which, in any event, exclude the European Collateral, which does not secure the Notes), to the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the General Credit Facility and any future Priority Lien Obligations, that will be secured (A) on a first-priority basis by the same assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors that secure the Notes and by certain other assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Principal Properties, that do not secure the Notes and (B) on a second-priority basis by the Shared Receivables Collateral;  effectively subordinated to the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the Shared Receivables Collateral;  effectively subordinated to any obligations secured by Permitted Liens, to the extent of the value of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors subject to those Permitted Liens;  structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including the ABL Financing Entities and the Issuers Foreign Subsidiaries and any Unrestricted Subsidiaries;  ranked equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors but, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, are effectively senior to all of the Issuers and the Guarantors unsecured senior Indebtedness (including the Existing Notes);  senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined with respect to the Notes) of the Issuer; and  initially unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several and senior basis by each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the General Credit Facility (other than any Foreign Subsidiary). Guarantees The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest in respect of the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture. The Restricted Subsidiaries which guarantee the General Credit Facility guarantee the Notes. Each of the Guarantees of the Notes is a general senior obligation of each Guarantor and is secured by a second-priority lien on all of the assets of each Guarantor which secure the General Credit Facility and which are not Principal Properties and by a third-priority lien on all of the assets of each Guarantor which secure the ABL Facility. The Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor but, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, are effectively senior to all of the Guarantors unsecured senior Indebtedness and, to the extent of the Collateral, are effectively subordinated to the Guarantors Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and any future Priority Lien Obligations. The Guarantees are senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of each Guarantor. The Notes are structurally subordinated to Indebtedness and other liabilities of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the Notes. Not all of the Issuers Subsidiaries Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. 44 Table of Contents None of our Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Existing Notes Indenture, Foreign Subsidiaries, ABL Financing Entities, non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiaries guarantee the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to our offering of $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien notes in April 2009 and the use of proceeds therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for approximately $11.867 billion, or 41.8%, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.038 billion, or 40.9%, of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2009, approximately $9.876 billion, or 40.7%, of our total assets, and approximately $7.517 billion, or 22.5%, of our total liabilities, in each case, as of December 31, 2008, and approximately $9.817 billion, or 40.4%, of our total assets, and approximately $7.224 billion, or 21.9%, of our total liabilities, in each case, as of March 31, 2009. Any entity that makes a payment under its Guarantee is entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantors liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Notes  Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes, and with respect to the senior secured notes, the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payment on the notes. Each Guarantee by a Guarantor provides by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) (a) any sale, exchange or transfer (by merger or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor, which sale, exchange or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (b) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of the Senior Credit Facilities or such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee; (c) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; or (d) the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or the discharge of the Issuers obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; and (2) such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. Holding Company Structure The Issuer is a holding company for its Subsidiaries, with no material operations of its own and only limited assets. Accordingly, the Issuer is dependent upon the distribution of the earnings of its Subsidiaries, whether in the form of dividends, advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations, to service its debt obligations. 45 Table of Contents Security General The Notes and the Guarantees are secured by perfected second-priority security interests in the Non-Receivables Collateral (second in priority to the Liens on the Non-Receivables Collateral securing the First Lien Obligations) and by perfected third-priority security interests in the Shared Receivables Collateral (third in priority to the first-priority and second-priority Liens on the Shared Receivables Collateral securing the ABL Obligations and the First Lien Obligations, respectively), in each case, subject to Permitted Liens; provided , that with respect to the portion of the Collateral comprised of real property, the Issuer and the Guarantors have such time as is reasonably necessary from the Issue Date to complete the actions required to perfect the second-priority Lien on such Collateral. The Cash Pay Notes and the Toggle Notes share in the benefit of such security interests pro rata based on the respective amounts of the Obligations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Notes nor the Guarantees are or will be secured by the European Collateral or the Separate Receivables Collateral and, until after the Discharge of the First Lien Obligations, the Notes and the Guarantees will not be secured by any Principal Properties. Upon the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and so long as no First Lien Obligations are outstanding, the Principal Properties that constituted Collateral under the First Lien Security Documents Facility will become Collateral with respect to the Notes, subject to the same limitation on the amount of Obligations secured thereby as contained in the First Lien Security Documents. See also  Certain Limitations on the Collateral below. Priority Lien Secured Parties have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the respective agents under the Intercreditor Agreements to realize or foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of holders of the Notes. For a description of the Shared Receivables Collateral and the Non-Receivables Collateral, see Description of Other Indebtedness  Senior Secured Credit Facilities  Guarantee and Security. The Issuer and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which could share in the Collateral, including additional First Lien Obligations, additional ABL Obligations, additional Junior Lien Obligations and Obligations secured by Permitted Liens. The amount of such additional Obligations are and will be limited by the covenant described under Certain Covenants  Liens and the covenant described under Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. Under certain circumstances, the amount of any such additional Obligations could be significant. After-Acquired Collateral From and after the Issue Date and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, (a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset that would constitute Collateral to secure any First Lien Obligations (other than Principal Properties prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and so long as no First Lien Obligations are outstanding and other than European Collateral and Separate Receivables Collateral), it must concurrently grant a second-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon such property as security for the Notes and (b) if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset that would constitute Shared Receivables Collateral to secure any Priority Lien Obligations, it must concurrently grant a third-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon such property as security for the Notes. Liens with Respect to the Collateral Security Documents and Intercreditor Agreements The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Junior Lien Collateral Agent entered into the Security Documents with respect to the Collateral defining the terms of the security interests that secure the Notes and the Guarantees with respect to such Collateral. These security interests secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Security Documents, as provided in the Security Documents. 46 Table of Contents The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Collateral Agent entered into the General Intercreditor Agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the General Intercreditor Agreement ) with respect to the Collateral. The First Lien Collateral Agent is initially the Collateral Agent under the General Credit Facility. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent is initially the Trustee. Pursuant to the terms of the General Intercreditor Agreement, prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Collateral Agent, acting on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties, will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the Collateral will be enforced and will have the sole and exclusive right to manage, perform and enforce the terms of the Security Documents relating to the Collateral and to exercise and enforce all privileges, rights and remedies thereunder according to its direction, including to take or retake control or possession of such Collateral and to hold, prepare for sale, marshall, process, sell, lease, dispose of or liquidate such Collateral, including, without limitation, following the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent will not be permitted to enforce the security interests even if any Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and the Notes have been accelerated except (a) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, solely as necessary to file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations or (b) as necessary to take any action in order to prove, preserve, perfect or protect (but not enforce) its security interest and rights in, and the perfection and priority of its Lien on, the Collateral. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Notes  The lien ranking provisions of the Indenture and other agreements relating to the collateral securing the notes will limit the rights of holders of the notes with respect to that collateral, even during an event of default. After the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Junior Lien Documents will distribute all cash proceeds (after payment of the costs of enforcement and collateral administration and any other amounts owed to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent) of the Collateral received by it under the Security Documents for the ratable benefit of the holders of Junior Lien Obligations. The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after the satisfaction of all First Lien Obligations may not be sufficient to satisfy the Junior Lien Obligations. By its nature some or all of the Collateral is and will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, if salable. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Notes  The value of the collateral securing the notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, has agreed in the General Intercreditor Agreement that (a) it will not (and thereby waives any right to) take any action to challenge, contest or support any other Person in contesting or challenging, directly or indirectly, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of a Lien securing any First Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the First Lien Collateral Agent or any of the First Lien Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor in any Collateral or other First Lien Collateral and (b) it will not oppose or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting) any request for judicial relief made in any court by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Parties relating to the lawful enforcement of any First Priority Lien on Collateral or other First Lien Collateral. In addition, the Security Documents provide that, prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, (1) the First Lien Collateral Agent may take actions with respect to the Collateral (including the release of Collateral and the manner of realization (subject to the provisions described under  Release of Collateral)) without the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Secured Parties and (2) the Issuer and the Guarantors may require the Junior Lien Collateral Agent to agree to modify the Security Documents, or the General Intercreditor Agreement, without the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Secured Parties, to secure additional extensions of credit and add additional First Lien Secured Parties or Junior Lien Secured Parties so long as such modifications do not expressly violate the provisions of the General Credit Facility or the Indenture. In addition, the General Intercreditor Agreement provides that with respect to Collateral in the event that the First Lien Collateral Agent or the First Lien Secured Parties enter into any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of or replace any of the First Lien Security Documents for the purpose of adding to, or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures from any provisions of, any First Lien Security Document or changing in any manner the rights of the First Lien Collateral Agent, the First Lien Secured Parties, the Issuer or any Guarantor thereunder (including the release of any Liens in 47 Table of Contents Collateral in accordance with the provisions described under  Release of Collateral), then such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any comparable provision of each comparable Security Document in favor of the Junior Lien Obligations without the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative or any Junior Lien Secured Party and without any action by the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative, the Issuer or any Guarantor; provided that such amendment, waiver or consent does not materially adversely affect the rights of the Junior Lien Secured Parties or the interests of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Collateral in a manner materially different from that affecting the rights of the First Lien Secured Parties thereunder or therein. Any provider of additional extensions of credit shall be entitled to rely on the determination of an Officer that such modifications do not expressly violate the provisions of the General Credit Facility or the Indenture if such determination is set forth in an Officers Certificate delivered to such provider. So long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, the Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such Non-Receivables Collateral upon the exercise of remedies will be applied by the First Lien Collateral Agent to the First Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant First Lien Documents until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has occurred. Upon the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent (for the benefit of all Junior Lien Secured Parties) any remaining proceeds of Collateral held by it in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct to be applied by the Junior Lien Collateral Agent to the Junior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the Junior Lien Documents. In addition, so long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any Junior Lien Representative shall acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of the Issuer or any Subsidiary (and neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary shall grant such Lien) securing any Junior Lien Obligations that are not also subject to the First Priority Lien in respect of the First Lien Obligations under the First Lien Documents. If the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Representative shall acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of the Issuer or any Subsidiary that is not also subject to the First Priority Lien in respect of the First Lien Obligations under the First Lien Documents, then such Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Representative shall, without the need for any further consent of any party and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other document, be deemed to also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the First Lien Collateral Agent as security for the First Lien Obligations (subject to the lien priority and other terms hereof). The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Secured Party have agreed that any Lien purported to be granted on any Collateral as security for First Lien Obligations shall be deemed to be and shall be deemed to remain senior in all respects and prior to all Liens on the Collateral securing any Junior Lien Obligations for all purposes regardless of whether the Lien purported to be granted is found to be improperly granted, improperly perfected, preferential, a fraudulent conveyance or legally or otherwise deficient or invalid, in whole or in part, in any manner. Any Collateral or proceeds thereof received by any Junior Lien Secured Party at a time when such receipt is not expressly permitted by the terms of the General Intercreditor Agreement or prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations shall be segregated and held in trust for the benefit of and forthwith paid over to the First Lien Collateral Agent (and/or its designees) for the benefit of the First Lien Secured Parties in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. If any First Lien Secured Party is required in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Issuer or any other Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be fraudulent or preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a Recovery ), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise, then as among the parties hereto, the First Lien Obligations shall be deemed to be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and such First Lien Secured Party shall be entitled to a reinstatement of First Lien Obligations 48 Table of Contents with respect to all such recovered amounts and shall have all rights hereunder. If the General Intercreditor Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the General Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto. Any Collateral or other First Lien Collateral or proceeds thereof received by any Junior Lien Secured Party prior to the time of such Recovery shall be deemed to have been received prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph. In addition, if at any time in connection with or after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations the Issuer either in connection therewith or thereafter enters into any Refinancing of any First Lien Document evidencing a First Lien Obligation, then such Discharge of First Lien Obligations shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Documents and the Junior Lien Documents, and the obligations under such Refinancing shall automatically be treated as First Lien Obligations for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Collateral set forth therein, the related documents shall be treated as First Lien Documents for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement and the first lien collateral agent under such Refinanced First Lien Documents shall be First Lien Collateral Agent for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement. The General Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any other Junior Lien Secured Parties may assert or enforce any right of marshalling accorded to a junior lienholder, as against the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party (in their capacity as priority lienholders). Following the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Junior Lien Secured Parties may assert their right under the Uniform Commercial Code or otherwise to any proceeds remaining following a sale or other disposition of Collateral by, or on behalf of, the First Lien Collateral Agent or the First Lien Secured Parties. This waiver of all rights of marshalling prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations may result in proceeds from the sale of Collateral (in which the Junior Lien Secured Parties have second-priority Liens) being applied to repay First Lien Obligations prior to the application of the proceeds of Shared Receivables Collateral (in which the Junior Lien Secured Parties have third-priority Liens), the Principal Properties (in which the Junior Lien Secured Parties will not have a security interest prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and during any time that any First Lien Obligations are outstanding) or the European Collateral or the Separate Receivables Collateral (in which the Junior Lien Secured Parties do not have a security interest). In that scenario, Junior Lien Secured Parties may recover less than they would have if such proceeds were applied in the order most favorable to the Junior Lien Secured Parties. So long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor, (i) neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative nor any Junior Lien Secured Party will (x) exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or the right to credit bid debt (except as set forth in the next paragraph below)) with respect to any Collateral in respect of any applicable Junior Lien Obligations, or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), (y) contest, protest or otherwise object to any foreclosure or enforcement proceeding or action brought with respect to the Collateral or any other collateral by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party in respect of the First Lien Obligations, the exercise of any right by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party (or any agent or sub-agent on their behalf) in respect of the First Lien Obligations under any control agreement, lockbox agreement, landlord waiver or bailees letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative or any Junior Lien Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third-party beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party of any rights and remedies as a secured party relating to the Collateral or any other collateral under the First Lien Documents or otherwise in respect of First Lien Obligations, or (z) object to any waiver or forbearance by the First Lien Secured Parties from or in respect of bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to the Collateral or any other collateral in respect of First Lien Obligations and (ii) except as otherwise provided in the General 49 Table of Contents Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Secured Parties shall have the sole and exclusive right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including setoff and the right to credit bid their debt), marshal, process and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions, or waiver or forbearance of rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral without any consultation with or the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative or any Junior Lien Secured Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Intercreditor Agreement shall not be construed to in any way limit or impair the right of any Junior Lien Secured Party from exercising a credit bid with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations in a sale or other disposition of Collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code; provided that in connection with and immediately after giving effect to such sale and credit bid there occurs a Discharge of First Lien Obligations. In addition, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, each Junior Lien Representative and each other Junior Lien Secured Party have agreed that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding: (1) if the First Lien Collateral Agent acting on behalf of First Lien Secured Parties desires to permit the use of cash collateral or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain financing under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision in any Bankruptcy Law (DIP Financing) , including if such DIP Financing is secured by Liens senior in priority to the Liens securing the Notes or other Junior Lien Obligations, then the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, agrees not to object to such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to the extent permitted by the General Intercreditor Agreement, as set forth below) and, to the extent the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations are subordinated or pari passu with such DIP Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral and any other collateral to such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as they are subordinated to the First Lien Obligations; (2) none of them will object to, or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting), any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of the First Lien Obligations made by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party; (3) none of them will object to, or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting), any order relating to a sale of assets of any Issuer or Guarantor for which the First Lien Collateral Agent has consented that provides, to the extent that sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations and the Junior Lien Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the existing Liens in accordance with the General Intercreditor Agreement; (4) none of them will seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Collateral or any other First Lien Collateral, without the prior written consent of the First Lien Collateral Agent; (5) none of them will object to, or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting), (a) any request by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party for adequate protection or (b) any objection by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the First Lien Collateral Agents or such First Lien Secured Partys claiming a lack of adequate protection; (6) none of them will assert or enforce (or support any Person asserting or enforcing) any claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral or First Lien Collateral; 50 Table of Contents (7) none of them will oppose or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting) any lawful exercise by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party of the right to credit bid First Lien Obligations at any sale of Collateral or First Lien Collateral; and (8) none of them will challenge (or support any other person challenging) the validity, enforceability, perfection or priority of the First Priority Liens on Collateral or First Lien Collateral (and the General Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the First Lien Secured Parties agree that none of them will challenge the validity, enforceability, perfection or priority of the Liens in favor of the Trustee and each other Junior Lien Secured Party on the Collateral). In addition, neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative nor any other Junior Lien Secured Party will file or prosecute in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding any motion for adequate protection (or any comparable request for relief) based upon their respective security interests in the Collateral, except that: (1) any of them may freely seek and obtain relief granting a junior Lien co-extensive in all respects with, but subordinated to, all Liens granted in the insolvency or liquidation proceeding to, or for the benefit of, the First Lien Secured Parties (and the General Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the First Lien Secured Parties will not object to the granting of such a junior Lien); and (2) any of them may freely seek and obtain any relief upon a motion for adequate protection (or any comparable relief), without any condition or restriction whatsoever, at any time after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations. Without limiting the generality of any provisions of the General Intercreditor Agreement, any vote to accept, and any other act to support the confirmation or approval of, any Non-Conforming Plan of Reorganization shall be inconsistent with and, accordingly, a violation of the terms of the General Intercreditor Agreement, and the First Lien Collateral Agent shall be entitled to have any such vote to accept a Non-Conforming Plan of Reorganization dismissed and any such support of any Non-Conforming Plan of Reorganization withdrawn. Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Junior Lien Obligations (other than securities, instruments and chattel paper constituting part of the Collateral and deposited with the First Lien Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Security Documents and any Shared Receivables Collateral subject to a control agreement under the circumstances described in the First Lien Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of the Junior Lien Secured Parties, have acknowledged and agreed in the General Intercreditor Agreement that (a) the Junior Lien Secured Parties claims against the Issuer and/or any Guarantor in respect of the Collateral constitute junior claims separate and apart (and of a different class) from the senior claims of the First Lien Secured Parties against the Issuer and the Guarantor in respect of the Collateral, (b) the First Lien Obligations include all interest that accrues after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor at the rate provided for in the applicable First Lien Documents governing the same, whether or not a claim for post-petition interest is allowed or allowable in any such insolvency or liquidation proceeding and (c) the Intercreditor Agreement constitutes a subordination agreement under Section 510 of the Bankruptcy Code. 51 Table of Contents Release of Collateral The Issuer and the Guarantors are entitled to the release of property and other assets constituting Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes and the Junior Lien Obligations under any one or more of the following circumstances: (1) to enable us to consummate the sale, transfer or other disposition of such property or assets to the extent not prohibited under the covenant described under  Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales; (2) the release of Excess Proceeds or Collateral Excess Proceeds that remain unexpended after the conclusion of an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer conducted in accordance with the Indenture; (3) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor; (4) with the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and affected thereby and a majority of all Junior Lien Obligations (including the Notes) then outstanding and affected thereby (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, Junior Lien Obligations); or (5) as described under  Amendment, Supplement and Waiver below. The Junior Liens on any Collateral securing the Junior Lien Obligations will also terminate and be released automatically if the First Priority Liens on such Collateral securing First Lien Obligations are released by the First Lien Collateral Agent on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties, unless such release occurs in connection with, and after giving effect to, a Discharge of First Lien Obligations, which discharge is not in connection with a foreclosure of, or other exercise of remedies with respect to, Collateral by the First Lien Secured Parties (such discharge not in connection with any such foreclosure or exercise of remedies, a Payment Discharge ) ( provided that, in the case of a Payment Discharge, the Liens on any Collateral disposed of in connection with the satisfaction in whole or in part of First Lien Obligations shall be automatically released but any proceeds thereof not used for purposes of the Discharge of First Lien Obligations or otherwise in accordance with the Indenture shall be subject to Liens in favor of the Junior Lien Secured Parties). In the event of a Payment Discharge, the Junior Liens on Collateral shall become first-priority security interests, subject to Permitted Liens, any intercreditor agreements or arrangements among Junior Lien Secured Parties permitted under the General Intercreditor Agreement and, with respect to Shared Receivables Collateral, subject to the Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement; provided that if the Issuer or the Guarantors incur at any time thereafter any new or replacement First Lien Obligations permitted under the Indenture, then such Payment Discharge shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Documents and the Junior Lien Documents, and such new Obligations shall automatically be treated as First Lien Obligations for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Collateral set forth therein, and the related documents shall be treated as First Lien Documents. To the extent necessary and for so long as required for such Subsidiary not to be subject to any requirement pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act to file separate financial statements with the SEC (or any other governmental agency), the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Company shall not be included in the Collateral with respect to the respective Notes so affected (as described under  Certain Limitations on the Collateral) and shall not be subject to the Liens securing such Notes and the Junior Lien Obligations. The Junior Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees also will be released upon (i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any), are paid or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under 52 Table of Contents the Indenture as described below under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or a discharge of the Indenture as described under Satisfaction and Discharge. Any certificate or opinion required by Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act may be made by an Officer of the Company, except in cases where Section 314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent engineer, appraiser or other expert. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will not be required to comply with all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act if they determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of that section and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff, including no action letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act is inapplicable to the released Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, certain no action letters issued by the SEC have permitted an indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act to contain provisions permitting the release of collateral from Liens under such indenture in the ordinary course of the issuers business without requiring the issuer to provide certificates and other documents under Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act. The Issuer and the Guarantors may, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, among other things, without any release or consent by the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation:  selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien of the Security Documents that has become worn out, defective, obsolete or not used or useful in the business;  abandoning, terminating, canceling, releasing or making alterations in or substitutions of any leases or contracts subject to the Lien of the Indenture or any of the Security Documents;  surrendering or modifying any franchise, license or permit subject to the Lien of the Security Documents that it may own or under which it may be operating;  altering, repairing, replacing, changing the location or position of and adding to its structures, machinery, systems, equipment, fixtures and appurtenances;  granting a license of any intellectual property;  selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of inventory in the ordinary course of business;  collecting accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business as permitted by the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales;  making cash payments (including for the repayment of Indebtedness or interest) from cash that is at any time part of the Collateral in the ordinary course of business that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture and the Security Documents; and  abandoning any intellectual property that is no longer used or useful in the Issuers business. The Issuer must deliver an Officers Certificate to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent within 30 calendar days following the end of each six-month period beginning on May 15 and November 15 of each year, to the effect that all such releases and withdrawals during the preceding six-month period (or since the Issue Date, in the case of the first such certificate) in the ordinary course of the Issuers or the Guarantors business, as described in the preceding paragraph, were not prohibited by the Indenture. Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement In addition, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the collateral agent with respect to the ABL Facility (the ABL Collateral Agent ) entered into a Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement ) with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral. The Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral and the relative rights, 53 Table of Contents privileges and obligations relating thereto as between (a) the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, the other Junior Lien Secured Parties, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Secured Parties and (b) the ABL Collateral Agent and the ABL Secured Parties. The Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement provides for first-priority Liens in the Shared Receivables Collateral in favor of the ABL Secured Parties, second-priority Liens in the Shared Receivables Collateral in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties and third-priority security interests in the Shared Receivables Collateral in favor of the Junior Lien Secured Parties, in each case, subject to Permitted Liens. The relative rights, privileges and obligations with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral of the ABL Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, the other Junior Lien Secured Parties, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Secured Parties, on the other, are substantially identical to the relative rights, privileges and obligations with respect to the Non-Receivables Collateral of the First Lien Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Junior Lien Secured Parties, on the other, respectively, except that the Liens of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Shared Receivables Collateral are third-priority Liens and except to the extent customary or necessary with respect to collateral of the type that constitutes Shared Receivables Collateral. Certain Limitations on the Collateral The Collateral securing the Notes does not and will not include any of the following assets: (1) the property or assets owned by any Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor, including each ABL Financing Entity; (2) any rights or interests of the Issuer or any Guarantor in, to or under any agreement, contract, license, instrument, document or other general intangible (referred to solely for purposes of this clause (2) as a Contract ), any intellectual property or any security or other investment property (i) to the extent the security interest in such Collateral is prohibited by any applicable contract, agreement or other instrument without the consent of any other party thereto (other than a party to the General Credit Facility or the Indenture or, in the case of investment property, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary), (ii) to the extent the security interest in such Contract would give any other party (other than a party to the General Credit Facility or the Indenture or, in the case of investment property, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) to such Collateral the right to terminate its obligations thereunder or (iii) to the extent all necessary consents to such grant of a security interest have not been obtained from the other parties thereto (other than to the extent that any such prohibition referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law)); provided that this limitation shall not affect, limit, restrict or impair the grant by the Issuer or such Guarantor of a security interest in any account receivable or any money or other amounts due or to become due under any Contract; (3) any equipment of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is subject to, or secured by, a Capitalized Lease Obligation or Purchase Money Obligations and any equipment that constitutes an asset of an entity acquired in a transaction permitted by the Indenture to the extent that such equipment subject to a Lien permitted by the Indenture and the terms of the Indebtedness secured by such Lien prohibit assignment of, or granting of a security interest in, the Issuers or such Guarantors rights and interests therein (other than to the extent that any such prohibition would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law); provided that immediately upon the repayment of all Indebtedness secured by such Lien, the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have granted a security interest in all the rights and interests with respect to such equipment; (4) any Voting Stock that is issued by any Foreign Subsidiary, if and to the extent that the inclusion of such Voting Stock in the Collateral would cause the Collateral pledged by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, to include in the aggregate more than 65% of the total combined voting power of all classes of Voting Stock of such Foreign Subsidiary; 54 Table of Contents (5) any Capital Stock that is issued by a Subsidiary that is not owned directly by the Issuer or a Guarantor; (6) prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and so long as any First Lien Obligations are outstanding, any Principal Properties; (7) any Capital Stock and other securities of a Subsidiary (excluding Healthtrust, Inc.  The Hospital Company, a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns) to the extent that the pledge of such Capital Stock and other securities results in the Companys being required to file separate financial statements of such Subsidiary with the SEC, but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as such requirement is in existence and only with respect to the relevant Notes affected; provided that neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary shall take any action in the form of a reorganization, merger or other restructuring a principal purpose of which is to provide for the release of the Lien on any Capital Stock pursuant to this clause (7). In addition, in the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Subsidiary of the Company due to the fact that such Subsidiarys Capital Stock secures the Notes affected thereby, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral securing the relevant Notes affected thereby but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required to not be subject to such requirement. In such event, the Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder of such Notes, to the extent necessary to release the security interests in favor of the applicable collateral agents on the shares of Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral for the relevant Notes. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiarys Capital Stock to secure the Notes in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral for the relevant Notes but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to any such financial statement requirement; (8) certain non-Principal Properties that do not constitute Non-Receivables Collateral; (9) any deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts or cash of the Issuer or any Guarantor; (10) any leaseholds and motor vehicles of the Issuer or any Guarantor; (11) any Capital Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Capital Stock (i) if, in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the cost or other consequences of pledging such Collateral shall be excessive in view of the benefits to be obtained by the Junior Lien Secured Parties therefrom or (ii) the pledge of such Collateral would result in adverse tax consequences to the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries as reasonably determined by the Issuer and identified in writing to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent; (12) any collateral to the extent the grant of the security interest therein would violate any requirement of law; and (13) proceeds and products from any and all of the foregoing excluded collateral described in clauses (1) through (12), unless such proceeds or products would otherwise constitute Collateral securing the Notes. Sufficiency of Collateral The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of the healthcare industry, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair 55 Table of Contents market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, the ability of the holders to realize upon any of the Collateral may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations as described below. Certain Bankruptcy Limitations The right of the Trustee to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired by any Bankruptcy Law in the event that a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against the Company or any Guarantor prior to the Trustees having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Trustee is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security without bankruptcy court approval. In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the Trustee could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys fees to a secured creditor during a debtors bankruptcy case to the extent the value of such creditors interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes The Issuer must maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The initial paying agent for the Notes is the Trustee. The Issuer must also maintain a registrar with offices in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The initial registrar is the Trustee. The registrar maintains a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and makes payments on and facilitates transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar. Transfer and Exchange A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. Principal, Maturity and Interest The Issuer issued $5,700,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, of which $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount are 2014 Cash Pay Notes, $3,200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount are 2016 Cash Pay Notes and $1,500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount are Toggle Notes. The 2014 Cash Pay Notes will mature on November 15, 2014, the 2016 Cash Pay Notes will mature on November 15, 2016 and the Toggle Notes will mature on November 15, 2016. Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the 56 Table of Contents caption Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, the Issuer may issue additional 2014 Cash Pay Notes, 2016 Cash Pay Notes and/or Toggle Notes from time to time after this offering under the Indenture (any such 2014 Cash Pay Notes, 2016 Cash Pay Notes or Toggle Notes, Additional Notes ). In addition, in connection with the payment of PIK Interest or Partial PIK Interest in respect of the Toggle Notes, the Issuer is entitled to, without the consent of the Holders, increase the outstanding principal amount of the Toggle Notes or issue additional Toggle Notes (the PIK Notes ) under the Indenture on the same terms and conditions as the Toggle Notes (in each case, the PIK Payment ). The Cash Pay Notes and the Toggle Notes are each separate series of Notes but are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture, except as otherwise stated herein. As a result, Holders of each series of Notes do not have separate rights to, among other things, give notice of Defaults or to direct the Trustee to exercise remedies during Event of Default or otherwise. Except as described under Amendment, Supplement and Waiver, the Notes offered by the Issuer, the PIK Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Notes for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of Notes include any PIK Notes and Additional Notes that are actually issued, and references to principal amount of the Notes includes any increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Notes as a result of a PIK Payment. Cash Pay Notes 2014 Cash Pay Notes Interest on the 2014 Cash Pay Notes accrues at the rate of 9 1 / 8 % per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2007, to the Holders of 2014 Cash Pay Notes of record on the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1.

Interest on the Toggle Notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. For any interest payment period after the initial interest payment period and prior to November 15, 2011, the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on the Toggle Notes:  entirely in cash (Cash Interest) ;  entirely by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Toggle Notes or by issuing PIK Notes (PIK Interest) ; or  on 50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Toggle Notes in cash and on 50% of the principal amount by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Toggle Notes or by issuing PIK Notes (Partial PIK Interest) . 57 Table of Contents The Issuer must elect the form of interest payment with respect to each interest period by delivering a notice to the Trustee prior to the beginning of each interest period. The Trustee shall promptly deliver a corresponding notice to the Holders. In the absence of such an election for any interest period, interest on the Toggle Notes shall be payable according to the election for the previous interest period. Interest for the first interest period commencing on the Issue Date shall be payable entirely in cash. After November 15, 2011, the Issuer will make all interest payments on the Toggle Notes entirely in cash. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the payment of accrued interest in connection with any redemption of Toggle Notes as described under  Optional Redemption  Toggle Notes or Repurchase at the Option of Holders shall be made solely in cash. Cash Interest on the Toggle Notes accrues at a rate of 9 5 / 8 % per annum and is payable in cash. PIK Interest on the Toggle Notes accrues at a rate of 10 3 / 8 % per annum and is payable (x) with respect to Toggle Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of, or held by, The Depository Trust Company (DTC) or its nominee on the relevant record date, by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding global Toggle Note by an amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest $1,000) and (y) with respect to Toggle Notes represented by certificated notes, by issuing PIK Notes in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable period (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar), and the Trustee will, at the request of the Issuer, authenticate and deliver such PIK Notes in certificated form for original issuance to the Holders on the relevant record date, as shown by the records of the register of Holders. In the event that the Issuer elects to pay Partial PIK Interest for any interest period, each Holder will be entitled to receive Cash Interest in respect of 50% of the principal amount of the Toggle Notes held by such Holder on the relevant record date and PIK Interest in respect of 50% of the principal amount of the Toggle Notes held by such Holder on the relevant record date. Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding global Toggle Notes as a result of a PIK Payment, the global Toggle Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such PIK Payment. Any PIK Notes issued in certificated form will be dated as of the applicable interest payment date and will bear interest from and after such date. All Toggle Notes issued pursuant to a PIK Payment will mature on November 15, 2016 and will be governed by, and subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of, the Indenture and shall have the same rights and benefits as the Toggle Notes issued on the Issue Date. Any certificated PIK Notes will be issued with the description PIK on the face of such PIK Note. If the toggle notes would otherwise constitute applicable high yield discount obligations within the meaning of Section 163(i)(1) of the Code, at the end of the first accrual period ending after the fifth anniversary of the toggle notes issuance (the AHYDO redemption date ), the Issuer will be required to redeem for cash a portion of each toggle note then outstanding equal to the Mandatory Principal Redemption Amount (such redemption, a Mandatory Principal Redemption ). The redemption price for the portion of each toggle note redeemed pursuant to a Mandatory Principal Redemption will be 100% of the principal amount of such portion plus any accrued interest thereon on the date of redemption. The Mandatory Principal Redemption Amount means the portion of a toggle note required to be redeemed to prevent such toggle note from being treated as an applicable high yield discount obligation within the meaning of Section 163(i)(1) of the Code. No partial redemption or repurchase of the toggle notes prior to the AHYDO redemption date pursuant to any other provision of the indenture will alter the Issuers obligation to make the Mandatory Principal Redemption with respect to any toggle notes that remain outstanding on the AHYDO redemption date. Additional Interest Additional Interest may accrue on the Notes in certain circumstances pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Any Additional Interest on the Notes will be payable in the same form elected by the Issuer for payment of interest for the applicable interest payment period. All references in the Indenture, in any context, to any interest or other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes shall be deemed to include any Additional Interest pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. 58 Table of Contents Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose within the City and State of New York or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

At any time prior to November 15, 2011, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Toggle Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder of Toggle Notes or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Toggle Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, subject to the rights of Holders of Toggle Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. On and after November 15, 2011, the Issuer may redeem the Toggle Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder of Toggle Notes or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Toggle Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of Toggle Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on November 15 of each of the years indicated below: Year Percentage 2011 104.813 2012 103.208 2013 101.604 2014 and thereafter 100.000 In addition, until November 15, 2009, the Issuer may, at its option, on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Toggle Notes at a redemption price equal to 109.625% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of Toggle Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that at least 50% of the sum of the original aggregate principal amount of Toggle Notes issued under the Indenture and the original principal amount of any Additional Notes that are Toggle Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption; provided further that each such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering. Any notice of any redemption may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering or other corporate transaction. If the Issuer redeems less than all of the outstanding Toggle Notes, the Trustee shall select the Toggle Notes to be redeemed in the manner described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Selection and Notice. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control The Notes provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under Optional Redemption, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the Change of Control Offer) at a price in cash (the Change of Control Payment) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive 61 Table of Contents interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register with a copy to the Trustee or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled Change of Control and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the Change of Control Payment Date ); (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled Option of Holder to Elect Purchase on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the 30th day following the date of the Change of Control notice, a telegram, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) that if the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes, the Holders of the remaining Notes will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and (8) the other instructions, as determined by us, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with 62 Table of Contents respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Facilities, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities being declared due and payable and could cause a Receivables Facility to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain Covenants  Liens. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer is not required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. Asset Sales The Indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and 63 Table of Contents (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiarys most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which the Issuer and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all creditors in writing, (b) any securities received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale, and (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 5% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose. Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to permanently reduce: (a) Obligations under Priority Lien Obligations and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (b) Obligations under Senior Indebtedness (other than any Junior Lien Obligation) that is secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture (which Lien is senior to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral), and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (c) Obligations under Junior Lien Obligations (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto) through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer in accordance with the procedures set forth below; provided that the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under Optional Redemption, through open-market purchases or otherwise by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of the Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; (d) Obligations under the Existing Notes which have a final maturity date (as in effect on the Issue Date) on or prior to November 15, 2016; provided that, at the time of, and after giving effect to, such repurchase, redemption or defeasance, the aggregate amount of Net Proceeds used to repurchase, redeem or defease Existing Notes pursuant to this subclause (d) following the Issue Date shall not exceed 5% of the consolidated total assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries at such time; or (e) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (or any affiliate thereof); (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business; or 64 Table of Contents (3) to make an investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer, or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an Acceptable Commitment ) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a Second Commitment ) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided , further , that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of Collateral that are not invested or applied as set forth in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute Collateral Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any Junior Lien Obligations which are not subordinated to the Notes or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral), to the holders of such Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations (a Collateral Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Collateral Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence a Collateral Asset Sale Offer with respect to Collateral Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Collateral Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of non-Collateral that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of the second preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Senior Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (an Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Junior Lien Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted by the Indenture (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral) tendered pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer is less than the Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Senior Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis 65 Table of Contents based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations tendered. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Senior Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Senior Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of any such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds or Excess Proceeds, as the case may be, shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer using proceeds from any Asset Sale at any time after consummation of such Asset Sale; provided that such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $50.0 million. Upon consummation of such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer, any Net Proceeds not required to be used to purchase Notes shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Selection and Notice If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes issued by it at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed (a) if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes are listed, (b) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable or (c) by lot or such other similar method in accordance with the procedures of DTC. Notices of purchase or redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes at such Holders registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. The Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. Certain Covenants Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a Covenant Suspension Event ), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants (collectively, the Suspended Covenants ): (1) Repurchase at the Option of Holders; (2)  Limitation on Restricted Payments; 66 Table of Contents (3)  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of  Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets; (5)  Transactions with Affiliates; and (6)  Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries. In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the Reversion Date ) one or both of the Rating Agencies (a) withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating and/or (b) the Issuer or any of its Affiliates enter into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating Agencies indicate that if consummated, such transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or refinancing transactions) would cause such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the ratings assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events, including, without limitation, a proposed transaction described in clause (b) above. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the Suspension Period . Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Proceeds shall be reset at zero. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indentures with respect to Notes; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption  Limitation on Restricted Payments had been in effect prior to, but not during the Suspension Period, provided that any Subsidiaries designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period shall automatically become Restricted Subsidiaries on the Reversion Date (subject to the Issuers right to subsequently designate them as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in compliance with the covenants set out below) and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings. Limitation on Restricted Payments The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuers, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger or consolidation other than: (a) dividends or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer; or (b) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities; 67 Table of Contents (II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, including in connection with any merger or consolidation; (III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness, other than: (a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; or (b) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase or acquisition; or (IV) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exception thereto) being collectively referred to as Restricted Payments ), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment: (1) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first paragraph of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; and (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1), (2) (with respect to the payment of dividends on Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below) pursuant to clause (b) thereof only), (6)(c), (9) and (14) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without duplication): (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning October 1, 2006, to the end of the Issuers most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; plus (b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received by the Issuer since immediately after the Issue Date (other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock) from the issue or sale of: (i) (A) Equity Interests of the Issuer, including Treasury Capital Stock (as defined below), but excluding cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received from the sale of: (x) Equity Interests to members of management, directors or consultants of the Issuer, any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer and the Issuers Subsidiaries after the Issue Date to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph; and (y) Designated Preferred Stock; and 68 Table of Contents (B) to the extent such net cash proceeds are actually contributed to the Issuer, Equity Interests of the Issuers direct or indirect parent companies (excluding contributions of the proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock of such companies or contributions to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph); or (ii) debt securities of the Issuer that have been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests of the Issuer; provided, however , that this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (V) Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below), (W) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of the Issuer sold to a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, (X) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock, (Y) Excluded Contributions or (Z) the Delayed Equity Amount; plus (c) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property contributed to the capital of the Issuer following the Issue Date (other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds (i) have been used to incur Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, (ii) are contributed by a Restricted Subsidiary, (iii) constitute Excluded Contributions or (iv) constitute the Delayed Equity Amount); plus (d) 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received by means of: (i) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repayments of loans or advances, and releases of guarantees, which constitute Restricted Investments by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after the Issue Date; or (ii) the sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than in each case to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment) or a dividend from an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date; plus (e) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date, the fair market value of the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, as determined by the Issuer in good faith (or if such fair market value exceeds $250.0 million, in writing by an Independent Financial Advisor), at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary other than to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment.

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, designate any additional subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Existing Notes Indenture) for purposes of the Existing Notes Indenture. Liens The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures obligations under any Indebtedness or any related Guarantee, on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless: (1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and related Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; or (2) in all other cases, the Notes or the Guarantees are equally and ratably secured or are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; except that the foregoing shall not apply to (a) Liens securing the Notes and the related Guarantees, (b) Liens securing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under Credit Facilities, including any letter of credit relating thereto, that was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; provided that, with respect to Liens securing Obligations permitted under this subclause (b), the Notes and the related Guarantees are secured by Liens on the assets subject to such Liens (except any European Collateral) to the extent, with the priority and subject to intercreditor arrangements, in each case no less favorable to the holders of the Notes than those described under Security above and (c) Liens which are senior in priority to the Liens securing the Notes and related Guarantees and are incurred to secure Obligations in respect of any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenant described above under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; provided that, with respect to Liens securing Obligations permitted under this subclause (c), (i) at the time of incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto, the ratio of (1) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness subject to a Lien incurred pursuant to subclause (b) above, this subclause (c) and clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Liens (other than Liens securing Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (4) and (18) of the covenant described above under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock) to (2) the Issuers EBITDA for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such event for which such calculation is being made shall occur, in each case with such pro forma adjustments to Indebtedness and EBITDA as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be no greater than 4.25 to 1.0 and (ii) the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by Liens with the priority and subject to intercreditor arrangements no less favorable to the holders of the Notes than those described under  Security above.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor will, and the Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer or Guarantor is the surviving 79 Table of Contents corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability corporation or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, as the case may be, or the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the Successor Person ); (b) the Successor Person, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantors related Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (c) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; and (d) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture; or (2) the transaction is made in compliance with the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantors Guarantee.

Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries on its Capital Stock or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or (b) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, except (in each case) for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (a) contractual encumbrances or restrictions in effect on the Issue Date, including pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities and the related documentation and the Existing Notes Indenture and the related documentation; (b) the Indenture and the Notes; (c) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the nature discussed in clause (3) above on the property so acquired; (d) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order; (e) any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in existence at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired; (f) contracts for the sale of assets, including customary restrictions with respect to a Subsidiary of the Issuer pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of such Subsidiary; (g) Secured Indebtedness that limits the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness that is otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenants described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and  Liens; 82 Table of Contents (h) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business; (i) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (j) customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other agreements or arrangements relating solely to such joint venture; (k) customary provisions contained in leases or licenses of intellectual property and other agreements, in each case entered into in the ordinary course of business; (l) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (k) above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no more restrictive with respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing; and (m) restrictions created in connection with any Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect the transactions contemplated under such Receivables Facility. Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor), other than a Guarantor, a Foreign Subsidiary or a Receivables Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any other Guarantor unless: (1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor: (a) if the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee are subordinated in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Guarantee under the supplemental indenture shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiarys guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness substantially to the same extent as the Notes are subordinated to such Indebtedness; and (b) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and (2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives, and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee; provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to (i) any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) guarantees of the ABL Facility by the ABL Financing Entities or of any Receivables Facility by any Receivables Subsidiary. 83 Table of Contents Reports and Other Information Notwithstanding that the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Indenture requires the Issuer to file with the SEC (and make available to the Trustee and Holders of the Notes (without exhibits), without cost to any Holder, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC) from and after the Issue Date, (1) within 90 days (or any other time period then in effect under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act with respect to the filing of a Form 10-K by a non-accelerated filer) after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form, containing the information required to be contained therein, or required in such successor or comparable form; (2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports on Form 10-Q containing all quarterly information that would be required to be contained in Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form; (3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other reports on Form 8-K, or any successor or comparable form; and (4) any other information, documents and other reports which the Issuer would be required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; in each case in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form; provided that the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Issuer will make available such information to prospective purchasers of Notes, in addition to providing such information to the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, in each case within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer has agreed that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer becomes a Guarantor of the Notes, the Indenture permits the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to such parent; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such requirements shall be deemed satisfied prior to the commencement of the exchange offers or the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement described in the Registration Rights Agreement (1) by the filing with the SEC of the exchange offer registration statement or shelf registration statement (or any other similar registration statement), and any amendments thereto, with such financial information that satisfies Regulation S-X, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in the Offering Memorandum, to the extent filed within the times specified above, or (2) by posting reports that would be required to be filed substantially in the form required by the SEC on the Companys website (or that of any of its parent companies) or providing such reports to the Trustee within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the financial information (including a Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section) that would be required to be included in such reports, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in the Offering Memorandum, to the extent filed within the times specified above. 84 Table of Contents Events of Default and Remedies The Indenture provides that each of the following is an Event of Default : (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest or Additional Interest on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less 30% in principal amount of the Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $200.0 million or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $200.0 million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary; (7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, as the case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture; or (8) with respect to any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of $200 million, individually or in the aggregate, (a) the security interest under the Security Documents, at any time, ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, (b) any security interest created thereunder or under the Indenture is declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or (c) the Issuer or any Guarantor asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. 85 Table of Contents Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders of the Notes. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within five Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default. 86 Table of Contents No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies (other than the Issuer and the Guarantors) shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting the Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

Senior Secured Notes Issued Under the 2009 Second Lien Indenture HCA Inc. has issued senior secured notes as described below under an indenture, dated as of February 19, 2009, among the Issuer, the Guarantors, The Bank of New York Mellon as collateral agent and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Terms used in this  Senior Secured Notes Issued Under the 2009 Second Lien Indenture apply only to the Notes described herein. General Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading Certain Definitions. In this description, the terms we , our, us and the Company each refer to HCA Inc. (the Issuer ) and its consolidated Subsidiaries. The Issuer issued $310.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9 7 / 8 % senior secured notes due 2017 (the Notes ) under an indenture dated as of February 19, 2009 (the Indenture ) among the Issuer, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee ). The Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Notes are substantially identical and include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of those agreements, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, and not this description, will define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Brief Description of Notes The Notes:  are general senior obligations of the Issuer;  are secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with the 2006 Notes and all future obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under any future Junior Lien Obligations, by all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors which are not Principal Properties and which secure the General Credit Facility (other than the European Collateral), subject to the Liens securing the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the General Credit Facility and any other Priority Lien Obligations and other Permitted Liens;  are secured on a third-priority basis, equally and ratably with the 2006 Notes and all future obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under any future Junior Lien Obligations, by all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors securing the ABL Facility which also secure the General Credit Facility, subject to the Liens securing the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and any other Priority Lien Obligations and other Permitted Liens;  are effectively subordinated, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness (which, in any event, exclude the European Collateral, which does not secure the Notes), to the Issuers and the 117 Table of Contents Guarantors obligations under the General Credit Facility and any future Priority Lien Obligations, that will be secured (A) on a first-priority basis by the same assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors that secure the Notes and by certain other assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Principal Properties, that do not secure the Notes and (B) on a second-priority basis by the Shared Receivables Collateral;  are effectively subordinated to the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the Shared Receivables Collateral;  are effectively subordinated to any obligations secured by Permitted Liens, to the extent of the value of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors subject to those Permitted Liens;  are structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including the ABL Financing Entities and the Issuers Foreign Subsidiaries and any Unrestricted Subsidiaries;  rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors but, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, will be effectively senior to all of the Issuers and the Guarantors unsecured senior Indebtedness (including the Existing Notes);  are senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined with respect to the Notes) of the Issuer;  are initially unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several and senior basis by each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the General Credit Facility (other than any Foreign Subsidiary); and  are subject to registration with the SEC pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Guarantees The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest in respect of the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture. The Restricted Subsidiaries which guarantee the General Credit Facility guarantee the Notes. Each of the Guarantees of the Notes is a general senior obligation of each Guarantor and is secured by a second-priority lien on all of the assets of each Guarantor which secure the General Credit Facility and which are not Principal Properties and by a third-priority lien on all of the assets of each Guarantor which secure the ABL Facility. The Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor but, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, are effectively senior to all of the Guarantors unsecured senior Indebtedness and, to the extent of the Collateral, are effectively subordinated to the Guarantors Obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and any future Priority Lien Obligations. The Guarantees are senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of each Guarantor. The Notes are structurally subordinated to Indebtedness and other liabilities of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the Notes. Not all of the Issuers Subsidiaries Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. None of our Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Existing Notes Indenture, Foreign Subsidiaries, ABL Financing Entities, non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to our offering of $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien notes in April 2009 and the use of proceeds therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have 118 Table of Contents accounted for approximately $11.867 billion, or 41.8%, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.038 billion, or 40.9%, of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2009, approximately $9.876 billion, or 40.7%, of our total assets, and approximately $7.517 billion, or 22.5%, of our total liabilities, in each case, as of December 31, 2008, and approximately $9.817 billion, or 40.4%, of our total assets, and approximately $7.224 billion, or 21.9%, of our total liabilities, in each case, as of March 31, 2009. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. Any entity that makes a payment under its Guarantee is entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantors liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Notes  Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes, and with respect to the senior secured notes, the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payment on the notes. Each Guarantee by a Guarantor provides by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) (a) any sale, exchange or transfer (by merger or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor, which sale, exchange or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (b) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of the Senior Credit Facilities or such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee; (c) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; or (d) the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or the discharge of the Issuers obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; and (2) such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. Holding Company Structure The Issuer is a holding company for its Subsidiaries, with no material operations of its own and only limited assets. Accordingly, the Issuer is dependent upon the distribution of the earnings of its Subsidiaries, whether in the form of dividends, advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations, to service its debt obligations. Security General The Notes and the Guarantees are secured by perfected second-priority security interests in the Non-Receivables Collateral (second in priority to the Liens on the Non-Receivables Collateral securing the First Lien Obligations) and by perfected third-priority security interests in the Shared Receivables Collateral (third 119 Table of Contents in priority to the first-priority and second-priority Liens on the Shared Receivables Collateral securing the ABL Obligations and the First Lien Obligations, respectively), in each case, equally and ratably with the 2006 Notes and subject to Permitted Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Notes nor the Guarantees are secured by the European Collateral or the Separate Receivables Collateral and, until after the Discharge of the First Lien Obligations, the Notes and the Guarantees will not be secured by any Principal Properties. Upon the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and so long as no First Lien Obligations are outstanding, the Principal Properties that constituted Collateral under the First Lien Security Documents Facility will become Collateral with respect to the Notes, subject to the same limitation on the amount of Obligations secured thereby as contained in the First Lien Security Documents. See also  Certain Limitations on the Collateral below. Priority Lien Secured Parties have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the respective agents under the Intercreditor Agreements to realize or foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of holders of the Notes. For a description of the Shared Receivables Collateral and the Non-Receivables Collateral, see Description of Other Indebtedness  Senior Secured Credit Facilities  Guarantee and Security. The Issuer and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which could share in the Collateral, including additional First Lien Obligations, additional ABL Obligations, additional Junior Lien Obligations and Obligations secured by Permitted Liens. The amount of such additional Obligations is and will be limited by the covenant described under Certain Covenants  Liens and the covenant described under Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. Under certain circumstances, the amount of any such additional Obligations could be significant. After-Acquired Collateral From and after the Issue Date and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, (a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset that would constitute Collateral to secure any First Lien Obligations (other than Principal Properties prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and so long as no First Lien Obligations are outstanding and other than European Collateral and Separate Receivables Collateral), it must concurrently grant a second-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon such property as security for the Notes and (b) if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset that would constitute Shared Receivables Collateral to secure any Priority Lien Obligations, it must concurrently grant a third-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon such property as security for the Notes. Liens with Respect to the Collateral Security Documents and Intercreditor Agreements The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Junior Lien Collateral Agent entered into Security Documents in connection with the 2006 Notes with respect to the Collateral defining the terms of the security interests that secure the 2006 Notes and the Guarantees with respect to such Collateral and that will define the terms of the security interests that secure the Notes and the Guarantees with respect to such collateral. These security interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Security Documents, as provided in the Security Documents. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Collateral Agent entered into a joinder to the General Intercreditor Agreement dated as of November 17, 2006 by and among the trustee under the 2006 Notes and the administrative agent under the General Credit Facility (as the same may be amended from time to time, the General Intercreditor Agreement ) with respect to the Collateral. The First Lien Collateral Agent is initially the Collateral Agent under the General Credit Facility. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent is initially the trustee under the 2006 Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the General Intercreditor Agreement, prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Collateral Agent, acting on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties, will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the Collateral will be enforced 120 Table of Contents and will have the sole and exclusive right to manage, perform and enforce the terms of the Security Documents relating to the Collateral and to exercise and enforce all privileges, rights and remedies thereunder according to its direction, including to take or retake control or possession of such Collateral and to hold, prepare for sale, marshall, process, sell, lease, dispose of or liquidate such Collateral, including, without limitation, following the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent will not be permitted to enforce the security interests even if any Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and the Notes have been accelerated except (a) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, solely as necessary to file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations or (b) as necessary to take any action in order to prove, preserve, perfect or protect (but not enforce) its security interest and rights in, and the perfection and priority of its Lien on, the Collateral. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Notes  The lien ranking provisions of the Indenture and other agreements relating to the collateral securing the notes will limit the rights of holders of the notes with respect to that collateral, even during an event of default. After the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Junior Lien Documents will distribute all cash proceeds (after payment of the costs of enforcement and collateral administration and any other amounts owed to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent) of the Collateral received by it under the Security Documents for the ratable benefit of the holders of Junior Lien Obligations. The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after the satisfaction of all First Lien Obligations may not be sufficient to satisfy the Junior Lien Obligations. By its nature some or all of the Collateral is and will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, if salable. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Notes  The value of the collateral securing the notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, has agreed pursuant to the General Intercreditor Agreement that (a) it will not (and thereby waives any right to) take any action to challenge, contest or support any other Person in contesting or challenging, directly or indirectly, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of a Lien securing any First Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the First Lien Collateral Agent or any of the First Lien Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor in any Collateral or other First Lien Collateral and (b) it will not oppose or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting) any request for judicial relief made in any court by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Parties relating to the lawful enforcement of any First Priority Lien on Collateral or other First Lien Collateral. In addition, the Security Documents provide that, prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, (1) the First Lien Collateral Agent may take actions with respect to the Collateral (including the release of Collateral and the manner of realization (subject to the provisions described under  Release of Collateral)) without the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Secured Parties and (2) the Issuer and the Guarantors may require the Junior Lien Collateral Agent to agree to modify the Security Documents, or the General Intercreditor Agreement, without the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Secured Parties, to secure additional extensions of credit and add additional First Lien Secured Parties or Junior Lien Secured Parties so long as such modifications do not expressly violate the provisions of the General Credit Facility or the Indenture. In addition, the General Intercreditor Agreement provides that with respect to Collateral in the event that the First Lien Collateral Agent or the First Lien Secured Parties enter into any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of or replace any of the First Lien Security Documents for the purpose of adding to, or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any departures from any provisions of, any First Lien Security Document or changing in any manner the rights of the First Lien Collateral Agent, the First Lien Secured Parties, the Issuer or any Guarantor thereunder (including the release of any Liens in Collateral in accordance with the provisions described under  Release of Collateral), then such amendment, waiver or consent shall apply automatically to any comparable provision of each comparable Security Document in favor of the Junior Lien Obligations without the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative or any Junior Lien Secured Party and without any action by the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative, the Issuer or any Guarantor; provided that such amendment, waiver or consent does not materially adversely affect the rights of the Junior Lien Secured Parties or the 121 Table of Contents interests of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Collateral in a manner materially different from that affecting the rights of the First Lien Secured Parties thereunder or therein. Any provider of additional extensions of credit shall be entitled to rely on the determination of an Officer that such modifications do not expressly violate the provisions of the General Credit Facility or the Indenture if such determination is set forth in an Officers Certificate delivered to such provider. So long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, the Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such Non-Receivables Collateral upon the exercise of remedies will be applied by the First Lien Collateral Agent to the First Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant First Lien Documents until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has occurred. Upon the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent (for the benefit of all Junior Lien Secured Parties) any remaining proceeds of Collateral held by it in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct to be applied by the Junior Lien Collateral Agent to the Junior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the Junior Lien Documents. In addition, so long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any Junior Lien Representative shall acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of the Issuer or any Subsidiary (and neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary shall grant such Lien) securing any Junior Lien Obligations that are not also subject to the First Priority Lien in respect of the First Lien Obligations under the First Lien Documents. If the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Representative shall acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of the Issuer or any Subsidiary that is not also subject to the First Priority Lien in respect of the First Lien Obligations under the First Lien Documents, then such Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Representative shall, without the need for any further consent of any party and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other document, be deemed to also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the First Lien Collateral Agent as security for the First Lien Obligations (subject to the lien priority and other terms hereof). The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Secured Party have agreed that any Lien purported to be granted on any Collateral as security for First Lien Obligations shall be deemed to be and shall be deemed to remain senior in all respects and prior to all Liens on the Collateral securing any Junior Lien Obligations for all purposes regardless of whether the Lien purported to be granted is found to be improperly granted, improperly perfected, preferential, a fraudulent conveyance or legally or otherwise deficient or invalid, in whole or in part, in any manner. Any Collateral or proceeds thereof received by any Junior Lien Secured Party at a time when such receipt is not expressly permitted by the terms of the General Intercreditor Agreement or prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations shall be segregated and held in trust for the benefit of and forthwith paid over to the First Lien Collateral Agent (and/or its designees) for the benefit of the First Lien Secured Parties in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. If any First Lien Secured Party is required in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Issuer or any other Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be fraudulent or preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a Recovery ), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise, then as among the parties hereto, the First Lien Obligations shall be deemed to be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and such First Lien Secured Party shall be entitled to a reinstatement of First Lien Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts and shall have all rights hereunder. If the General Intercreditor Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the General Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto. Any Collateral or other First Lien Collateral or proceeds thereof received by any Junior Lien Secured Party prior to the time of such Recovery shall be deemed to have 122 Table of Contents been received prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph. In addition, if at any time in connection with or after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations the Issuer either in connection therewith or thereafter enters into any Refinancing of any First Lien Document evidencing a First Lien Obligation, then such Discharge of First Lien Obligations shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Documents and the Junior Lien Documents, and the obligations under such Refinancing shall automatically be treated as First Lien Obligations for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Collateral set forth therein, the related documents shall be treated as First Lien Documents for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement and the first lien collateral agent under such Refinanced First Lien Documents shall be First Lien Collateral Agent for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement. The General Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any other Junior Lien Secured Parties may assert or enforce any right of marshalling accorded to a junior lienholder, as against the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party (in their capacity as priority lienholders). Following the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Junior Lien Secured Parties may assert their right under the Uniform Commercial Code or otherwise to any proceeds remaining following a sale or other disposition of Collateral by, or on behalf of, the First Lien Collateral Agent or the First Lien Secured Parties. This waiver of all rights of marshalling prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations may result in proceeds from the sale of Collateral (in which the Junior Lien Secured Parties have second-priority Liens) being applied to repay First Lien Obligations prior to the application of the proceeds of Shared Receivables Collateral (in which the Junior Lien Secured Parties have third-priority Liens), the Principal Properties (in which the Junior Lien Secured Parties will not have a security interest prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and during any time that any First Lien Obligations are outstanding) or the European Collateral or the Separate Receivables Collateral (in which the Junior Lien Secured Parties do not have a security interest). In that scenario, Junior Lien Secured Parties may recover less than they would have if such proceeds were applied in the order most favorable to the Junior Lien Secured Parties. So long as the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor, (i) neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative nor any Junior Lien Secured Party will (x) exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or the right to credit bid debt (except as set forth in the next paragraph below)) with respect to any Collateral in respect of any applicable Junior Lien Obligations, or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), (y) contest, protest or otherwise object to any foreclosure or enforcement proceeding or action brought with respect to the Collateral or any other collateral by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party in respect of the First Lien Obligations, the exercise of any right by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party (or any agent or sub-agent on their behalf) in respect of the First Lien Obligations under any control agreement, lockbox agreement, landlord waiver or bailees letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative or any Junior Lien Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third-party beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party of any rights and remedies as a secured party relating to the Collateral or any other collateral under the First Lien Documents or otherwise in respect of First Lien Obligations, or (z) object to any waiver or forbearance by the First Lien Secured Parties from or in respect of bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to the Collateral or any other collateral in respect of First Lien Obligations and (ii) except as otherwise provided in the General Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Secured Parties shall have the sole and exclusive right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including setoff and the right to credit bid their debt), marshal, process and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions, or waiver or forbearance of rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral without any consultation with or the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative or any Junior Lien Secured Party. 123 Table of Contents Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Intercreditor Agreement shall not be construed to in any way limit or impair the right of any Junior Lien Secured Party from exercising a credit bid with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations in a sale or other disposition of Collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code; provided that in connection with and immediately after giving effect to such sale and credit bid there occurs a Discharge of First Lien Obligations. In addition, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, each Junior Lien Representative and each other Junior Lien Secured Party have agreed that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding: (1) if the First Lien Collateral Agent acting on behalf of First Lien Secured Parties desires to permit the use of cash collateral or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain financing under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision in any Bankruptcy Law ( DIP Financing ), including if such DIP Financing is secured by Liens senior in priority to the Liens securing the Notes or other Junior Lien Obligations, then the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, agrees not to object to such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to the extent permitted by the General Intercreditor Agreement, as set forth below) and, to the extent the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations are subordinated or pari passu with such DIP Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral and any other collateral to such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as they are subordinated to the First Lien Obligations; (2) none of them will object to, or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting), any motion for relief from the automatic stay or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of the First Lien Obligations made by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party; (3) none of them will object to, or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting), any order relating to a sale of assets of any Issuer or Guarantor for which the First Lien Collateral Agent has consented that provides, to the extent that sale is to be free and clear of Liens, that the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations and the Junior Lien Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the existing Liens in accordance with the General Intercreditor Agreement; (4) none of them will seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Collateral or any other First Lien Collateral, without the prior written consent of the First Lien Collateral Agent; (5) none of them will object to, or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting), (a) any request by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party for adequate protection or (b) any objection by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the First Lien Collateral Agents or such First Lien Secured Partys claiming a lack of adequate protection; (6) none of them will assert or enforce (or support any Person asserting or enforcing) any claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code senior to or on a parity with the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral or First Lien Collateral; (7) none of them will oppose or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting) any lawful exercise by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party of the right to credit bid First Lien Obligations at any sale of Collateral or First Lien Collateral; and (8) none of them will challenge (or support any other person challenging) the validity, enforceability, perfection or priority of the First Priority Liens on Collateral or First Lien Collateral (and the General Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the First Lien Secured Parties agree that none of them will 124 Table of Contents challenge the validity, enforceability, perfection or priority of the Liens in favor of the Trustee and each other Junior Lien Secured Party on the Collateral). In addition, neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative nor any other Junior Lien Secured Party will file or prosecute in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding any motion for adequate protection (or any comparable request for relief) based upon their respective security interests in the Collateral, except that: (1) any of them may freely seek and obtain relief granting a junior Lien co-extensive in all respects with, but subordinated to, all Liens granted in the insolvency or liquidation proceeding to, or for the benefit of, the First Lien Secured Parties (and the General Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the First Lien Secured Parties will not object to the granting of such a junior Lien); and (2) any of them may freely seek and obtain any relief upon a motion for adequate protection (or any comparable relief), without any condition or restriction whatsoever, at any time after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations. Without limiting the generality of any provisions of the General Intercreditor Agreement, any vote to accept, and any other act to support the confirmation or approval of, any Non-Conforming Plan of Reorganization shall be inconsistent with and, accordingly, a violation of the terms of the General Intercreditor Agreement, and the First Lien Collateral Agent shall be entitled to have any such vote to accept a Non-Conforming Plan of Reorganization dismissed and any such support of any Non-Conforming Plan of Reorganization withdrawn. Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Junior Lien Obligations (other than securities, instruments and chattel paper constituting part of the Collateral and deposited with the First Lien Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Security Documents and any Shared Receivables Collateral subject to a control agreement under the circumstances described in the First Lien Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of the Junior Lien Secured Parties, have acknowledged and agreed in the General Intercreditor Agreement that (a) the Junior Lien Secured Parties claims against the Issuer and/or any Guarantor in respect of the Collateral constitute junior claims separate and apart (and of a different class) from the senior claims of the First Lien Secured Parties against the Issuer and the Guarantor in respect of the Collateral, (b) the First Lien Obligations include all interest that accrues after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor at the rate provided for in the applicable First Lien Documents governing the same, whether or not a claim for post-petition interest is allowed or allowable in any such insolvency or liquidation proceeding and (c) the Intercreditor Agreement constitutes a subordination agreement under Section 510 of the Bankruptcy Code. Release of Collateral The Issuer and the Guarantors are entitled to the release of property and other assets constituting Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes and the Junior Lien Obligations under any one or more of the following circumstances: (1) to enable us to consummate the sale, transfer or other disposition of such property or assets to the extent not prohibited under the covenant described under  Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales; (2) the release of Excess Proceeds or Collateral Excess Proceeds that remain unexpended after the conclusion of an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer conducted in accordance with the Indenture; 125 Table of Contents (3) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor; (4) with the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and affected thereby and a majority of all Junior Lien Obligations (including the Notes) then outstanding and affected thereby (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, Junior Lien Obligations); or (5) as described under  Amendment, Supplement and Waiver below. The Junior Liens on any Collateral securing the Junior Lien Obligations will also terminate and be released automatically if the First Priority Liens on such Collateral securing First Lien Obligations are released by the First Lien Collateral Agent on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties, unless such release occurs in connection with, and after giving effect to, a Discharge of First Lien Obligations, which discharge is not in connection with a foreclosure of, or other exercise of remedies with respect to, Collateral by the First Lien Secured Parties (such discharge not in connection with any such foreclosure or exercise of remedies, a Payment Discharge ) ( provided that, in the case of a Payment Discharge, the Liens on any Collateral disposed of in connection with the satisfaction in whole or in part of First Lien Obligations shall be automatically released but any proceeds thereof not used for purposes of the Discharge of First Lien Obligations or otherwise in accordance with the Indenture shall be subject to Liens in favor of the Junior Lien Secured Parties). In the event of a Payment Discharge, the Junior Liens on Collateral shall become first-priority security interests, subject to Permitted Liens, any intercreditor agreements or arrangements among Junior Lien Secured Parties permitted under the General Intercreditor Agreement and, with respect to Shared Receivables Collateral, subject to the Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement; provided that if the Issuer or the Guarantors incur at any time thereafter any new or replacement First Lien Obligations permitted under the Indenture, then such Payment Discharge shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Documents and the Junior Lien Documents, and such new Obligations shall automatically be treated as First Lien Obligations for all purposes of the General Intercreditor Agreement, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of Collateral set forth therein, and the related documents shall be treated as First Lien Documents. To the extent necessary and for so long as required for such Subsidiary not to be subject to any requirement pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act to file separate financial statements with the SEC (or any other governmental agency), the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Company (excluding Healthtrust, Inc.  The Hospital Company, a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns) shall not be included in the Collateral with respect to the respective Notes so affected (as described under  Certain Limitations on the Collateral) and shall not be subject to the Liens securing such Notes and the Junior Lien Obligations. The Junior Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees also will be released upon (i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Security Documents (including the 2006 Notes) that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any), are paid or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as described below under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or a discharge of the Indenture as described under Satisfaction and Discharge. Any certificate or opinion required by Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act may be made by an Officer of the Company, except in cases where Section 314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent engineer, appraiser or other expert. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will not be required to comply with all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act if they determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of that section and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff, including no action letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act is inapplicable to the released Collateral. 126 Table of Contents Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, certain no action letters issued by the SEC have permitted an indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act to contain provisions permitting the release of collateral from Liens under such indenture in the ordinary course of the issuers business without requiring the issuer to provide certificates and other documents under Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act. The Issuer and the Guarantors may, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, among other things, without any release or consent by the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation:  selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien of the Security Documents that has become worn out, defective, obsolete or not used or useful in the business;  abandoning, terminating, canceling, releasing or making alterations in or substitutions of any leases or contracts subject to the Lien of the Indenture or any of the Security Documents;  surrendering or modifying any franchise, license or permit subject to the Lien of the Security Documents that it may own or under which it may be operating;  altering, repairing, replacing, changing the location or position of and adding to its structures, machinery, systems, equipment, fixtures and appurtenances;  granting a license of any intellectual property;  selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of inventory in the ordinary course of business;  collecting accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business as permitted by the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales;  making cash payments (including for the repayment of Indebtedness or interest) from cash that is at any time part of the Collateral in the ordinary course of business that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture and the Security Documents; and  abandoning any intellectual property that is no longer used or useful in the Issuers business. The Issuer must deliver an Officers Certificate to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent within 30 calendar days following the end of each six-month period beginning on May 15 and November 15 of each year, to the effect that all such releases and withdrawals during the preceding six-month period in the ordinary course of the Issuers or the Guarantors business, as described in the preceding paragraph, were not prohibited by the Indenture. Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement In addition, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, have entered into a joinder to the Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement dated as of November 17, 2006 by and among the trustee under the 2006 Notes, the administrative agent under the General Credit Facility and the administrative agent under the ABL Facility (as the same may be amended from time to time, the Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement ) with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral. The Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral and the relative rights, privileges and obligations relating thereto as between (a) the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, the other Junior Lien Secured Parties, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Secured Parties and (b) the collateral agent with respect to the ABL Facility (the ABL Collateral Agent) and the ABL Secured Parties. The Shared Receivables Intercreditor Agreement provides for first-priority Liens in the Shared Receivables Collateral in favor of the ABL Secured Parties, second-priority Liens in the Shared Receivables Collateral in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties and third-priority security interests in the Shared Receivables Collateral in favor of the Junior Lien Secured Parties, in each case, subject to Permitted Liens. The relative rights, privileges and obligations with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral of the ABL Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, the other Junior Lien Secured Parties, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Secured Parties, on the other, are substantially identical to the relative rights, privileges and obligations with respect to the Non- 127 Table of Contents Receivables Collateral of the First Lien Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Junior Lien Secured Parties, on the other, respectively, except that the Liens of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Shared Receivables Collateral are third-priority Liens and except to the extent customary or necessary with respect to collateral of the type that constitutes Shared Receivables Collateral. Certain Limitations on the Collateral The Collateral securing the Notes does not include any of the following assets: (1) the property or assets owned by any Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor, including each ABL Financing Entity; (2) any rights or interests of the Issuer or any Guarantor in, to or under any agreement, contract, license, instrument, document or other general intangible (referred to solely for purposes of this clause (2) as a Contract ), any intellectual property or any security or other investment property (i) to the extent the security interest in such Collateral is prohibited by any applicable contract, agreement or other instrument without the consent of any other party thereto (other than a party to the General Credit Facility or the Indenture or, in the case of investment property, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary), (ii) to the extent the security interest in such Contract would give any other party (other than a party to the General Credit Facility or the Indenture or, in the case of investment property, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) to such Collateral the right to terminate its obligations thereunder or (iii) to the extent all necessary consents to such grant of a security interest have not been obtained from the other parties thereto (other than to the extent that any such prohibition referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law); provided that this limitation shall not affect, limit, restrict or impair the grant by the Issuer or such Guarantor of a security interest in any account receivable or any money or other amounts due or to become due under any Contract; (3) any equipment of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is subject to, or secured by, a Capitalized Lease Obligation or Purchase Money Obligations and any equipment that constitutes an asset of an entity acquired in a transaction permitted by the Indenture to the extent that such equipment subject to a Lien permitted by the Indenture and the terms of the Indebtedness secured by such Lien prohibit assignment of, or granting of a security interest in, the Issuers or such Guarantors rights and interests therein (other than to the extent that any such prohibition would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law); provided that immediately upon the repayment of all Indebtedness secured by such Lien, the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have granted a security interest in all the rights and interests with respect to such equipment; (4) any Voting Stock that is issued by any Foreign Subsidiary, if and to the extent that the inclusion of such Voting Stock in the Collateral would cause the Collateral pledged by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, to include in the aggregate more than 65% of the total combined voting power of all classes of Voting Stock of such Foreign Subsidiary; (5) any Capital Stock that is issued by a Subsidiary that is not owned directly by the Issuer or a Guarantor; (6) prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and so long as any First Lien Obligations are outstanding, any Principal Properties; (7) any Capital Stock and other securities of a Subsidiary (excluding Healthtrust, Inc.  The Hospital Company, a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns) to the extent that the pledge of such Capital Stock and other securities results in the Companys being required to file separate financial statements of such Subsidiary with the SEC, but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as such requirement is in existence and only with respect to the relevant Notes affected; provided that neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary shall take any action in the form of a 128 Table of Contents reorganization, merger or other restructuring a principal purpose of which is to provide for the release of the Lien on any Capital Stock pursuant to this clause (7). In addition, in the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Subsidiary of the Company (excluding Healthtrust, Inc.  The Hospital Company, a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns) due to the fact that such Subsidiarys Capital Stock secures the Notes affected thereby, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral securing the relevant Notes affected thereby but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required to not be subject to such requirement. In such event, the Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder of such Notes, to the extent necessary to release the security interests in favor of the applicable collateral agents on the shares of Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral for the relevant Notes. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiarys Capital Stock to secure the Notes in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral for the relevant Notes but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to any such financial statement requirement; (8) certain non-Principal Properties that do not constitute Non-Receivables Collateral; (9) any deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts or cash of the Issuer or any Guarantor; (10) any leaseholds and motor vehicles of the Issuer or any Guarantor; (11) any Capital Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Capital Stock (i) if, in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the cost or other consequences of pledging such Collateral shall be excessive in view of the benefits to be obtained by the Junior Lien Secured Parties therefrom or (ii) the pledge of such Collateral would result in adverse tax consequences to the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries as reasonably determined by the Issuer and identified in writing to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent; (12) any collateral to the extent the grant of the security interest therein would violate any requirement of law; and (13) proceeds and products from any and all of the foregoing excluded collateral described in clauses (1) through (12), unless such proceeds or products would otherwise constitute Collateral securing the Notes. Sufficiency of Collateral The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of the healthcare industry, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, the ability of the holders to realize upon any of the Collateral may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations as described below. Certain Bankruptcy Limitations The right of the Trustee to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired by any Bankruptcy Law in the event that a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against the Company or any Guarantor prior to the Trustees having repossessed and 129 Table of Contents disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Trustee is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security without bankruptcy court approval. In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the Trustee could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys fees to a secured creditor during a debtors bankruptcy case to the extent the value of such creditors interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes The Issuer must maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York or Atlanta, Georgia. The initial paying agent for the Notes is the Trustee. The Issuer must also maintain a registrar with offices in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York or Atlanta, Georgia. The initial registrar is the Trustee. The registrar maintains a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and makes payments on and facilitates transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar. Transfer and Exchange A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. Principal, Maturity and Interest The Issuer issued $310.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2017. Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, the Issuer may issue additional Notes, from time to time after this offering under the Indenture (any such Notes, Additional Notes ). Except as described under Amendment, Supplement and Waiver, the Notes offered by the Issuer and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Notes for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of Notes include any Additional Notes that are actually issued. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 9 7 / 8 % per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 commencing August 15, 2009, to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. 130 Table of Contents Additional Interest Additional Interest may accrue on the Notes in certain circumstances pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. All references in the Indenture, in any context, to any interest or other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes shall be deemed to include any Additional Interest pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose within the City and State of New York or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuers office or agency in New York will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption Repurchase at the Option of Holders. The Issuer may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below, the Issuer is not entitled to redeem Notes at its option prior to February 15, 2013. At any time prior to February 15, 2013, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of redemption (the Redemption Date ), subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. On and after February 15, 2013, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on February 15 of each of the years indicated below: Year Percentage 2013 104.938 % 2014 102.469 % 2015 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, until February 15, 2012, the Issuer may, at its option, on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes at a redemption price equal to 109.875% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that at least 50% of the sum of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture and the original principal amount of any Additional Notes that are Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption; provided further that each such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering. 131 Table of Contents Any notice of any redemption may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering or other corporate transaction. If the Issuer redeems less than all of the outstanding Notes, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed in the manner described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Selection and Notice. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control The Notes provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under Optional Redemption, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the Change of Control Offer ) at a price in cash (the Change of Control Payment ) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register with a copy to the Trustee or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled Change of Control and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the Change of Control Payment Date ); (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled Option of Holder to Elect Purchase on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the 30th day following the date of the Change of Control notice, a telegram, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) that if the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes, the Holders of the remaining Notes will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and (8) the other instructions, as determined by us, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any 132 Table of Contents securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Facilities, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities being declared due and payable and could cause a Receivables Facility to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain Covenants  Liens. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer is not required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether 133 Table of Contents a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. Asset Sales The Indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiarys most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which the Issuer and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all creditors in writing, (b) any securities received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale, and (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 5% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose. Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to permanently reduce: (a) Obligations under Priority Lien Obligations and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (b) Obligations under Senior Indebtedness (other than any Junior Lien Obligation) that is secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture (which Lien is senior to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral), and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (c) Obligations under Junior Lien Obligations (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto) through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer in accordance with the procedures set forth below; provided that the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under Optional Redemption, through open-market purchases or otherwise by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of the Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; 134 Table of Contents (d) Obligations under the Existing Notes which have a final maturity date (as in effect on the Issue Date) on or prior to November 15, 2016; provided that, at the time of, and after giving effect to, such repurchase, redemption or defeasance, the aggregate amount of Net Proceeds used to repurchase, redeem or defease Existing Notes pursuant to this subclause (d) following the Issue Date shall not exceed 5% of the consolidated total assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries at such time; or (e) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (or any affiliate thereof); (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business; or (3) to make an investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer, or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an Acceptable Commitment ) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a Second Commitment ) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided , further , that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of Collateral that are not invested or applied as set forth in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute Collateral Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any Junior Lien Obligations, including the 2006 Notes, which are not subordinated to the Notes or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral), to the holders of such Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations (a Collateral Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Collateral Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence a Collateral Asset Sale Offer with respect to Collateral Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Collateral Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of non-Collateral that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of the second preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Senior Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (an Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the 135 Table of Contents procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Junior Lien Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted by the Indenture (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral) tendered pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer is less than the Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Senior Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Junior Lien Obligations or such other Obligations tendered. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Senior Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Senior Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of any such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds or Excess Proceeds, as the case may be, shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer using proceeds from any Asset Sale at any time after consummation of such Asset Sale; provided that such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $50.0 million. Upon consummation of such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer, any Net Proceeds not required to be used to purchase Notes shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Selection and Notice If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes issued by it at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed (a) if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes are listed, (b) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable or (c) by lot or such other similar method in accordance with the procedures of DTC. Notices of purchase or redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes at such Holders registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. The Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. 136 Table of Contents Certain Covenants Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a Covenant Suspension Event ), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants (collectively, the Suspended Covenants ): (1) Repurchase at the Option of Holders; (2)  Limitation on Restricted Payments; (3)  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of  Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets; (5)  Transactions with Affiliates; and (6)  Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries. In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the Reversion Date ) one or both of the Rating Agencies (a) withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating and/or (b) the Issuer or any of its Affiliates enters into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating Agencies indicate that if consummated, such transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or refinancing transactions) would cause such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the ratings assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events, including, without limitation, a proposed transaction described in clause (b) above. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the Suspension Period . Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Proceeds shall be reset at zero. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indentures with respect to Notes; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption  Limitation on Restricted Payments had been in effect prior to, but not during the Suspension Period, provided that any Subsidiaries designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period shall automatically become Restricted Subsidiaries on the Reversion Date (subject to the Issuers right to subsequently designate them as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in compliance with the covenants set out below), and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings. 137 Table of Contents Limitation on Restricted Payments The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuers, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger or consolidation other than: (a) dividends or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer; or (b) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities; (II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, including in connection with any merger or consolidation; (III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness, other than: (a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; or (b) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase or acquisition; or (IV) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exception thereto) being collectively referred to as Restricted Payments ), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment: (1) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first paragraph of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; and (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after November 17, 2006 (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1), (2) (with respect to the payment of dividends on Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below) pursuant to clause (b) thereof only), (6)(c), (9) and (14) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without duplication): (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning October 1, 2006, to the end of the Issuers most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; plus (b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received by the Issuer since 138 Table of Contents immediately after November 17, 2006 (other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock) from the issue or sale of: (i) (A) Equity Interests of the Issuer, including Treasury Capital Stock (as defined below), but excluding cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received from the sale of: (x) Equity Interests to members of management, directors or consultants of the Issuer, any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer and the Issuers Subsidiaries after November 17, 2006 to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph; and (y) Designated Preferred Stock; and (B) to the extent such net cash proceeds are actually contributed to the Issuer, Equity Interests of the Issuers direct or indirect parent companies (excluding contributions of the proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock of such companies or contributions to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph); or (ii) debt securities of the Issuer that have been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests of the Issuer; provided , however , that this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (V) Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below), (W) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of the Issuer sold to a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, (X) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock, (Y) Excluded Contributions or (Z) the Delayed Equity Amount; plus (c) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property contributed to the capital of the Issuer following November 17, 2006 (other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds (i) have been used to incur Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, (ii) are contributed by a Restricted Subsidiary, (iii) constitute Excluded Contributions or (iv) constitute the Delayed Equity Amount); plus (d) 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received by means of: (i) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repayments of loans or advances, and releases of guarantees, which constitute Restricted Investments by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after November 17, 2006; or (ii) the sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than in each case to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment) or a dividend from an Unrestricted Subsidiary after November 17, 2006; plus (e) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary after November 17, 2006, the fair market value of the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, as 139 Table of Contents determined by the Issuer in good faith (or if such fair market value exceeds $250.0 million, in writing by an Independent Financial Advisor), at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary other than to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment.

Liens The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures obligations under any Indebtedness or any related Guarantee, on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless: (1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and related Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; or (2) in all other cases, the Notes or the Guarantees are equally and ratably secured or are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; except that the foregoing shall not apply to (a) Liens securing the Notes and the related Guarantees, (b) Liens securing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under Credit Facilities, including any letter of credit relating thereto, that was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; provided that, with respect to Liens securing Obligations permitted under this subclause (b), the Notes and the related Guarantees are secured by Liens on the assets subject to such Liens (except any European Collateral) to the extent, with the priority and subject to intercreditor arrangements, in each case no less favorable to the holders of the Notes than those described under Security above and (c) Liens which are senior in priority to the Liens securing the Notes and related Guarantees and are incurred to secure Obligations in respect of any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenant described above under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; provided that, with respect to Liens securing Obligations permitted under this subclause (c), (i) at the time of incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto, the ratio of (1) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness subject to a Lien incurred pursuant to subclause (b) above, this subclause (c) and clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Liens (other than Liens securing Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (4) and (18) of the covenant 148 Table of Contents described above under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock) to (2) the Issuers EBITDA for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such event for which such calculation is being made shall occur, in each case with such pro forma adjustments to Indebtedness and EBITDA as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be no greater than 4.25 to 1.0 and (ii) the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by Liens with the priority and subject to intercreditor arrangements no less favorable to the holders of the Notes than those described under  Security above. Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets The Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) the Issuer is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the Successor Company ); (2) the Successor Company, if other than the Issuer, expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Security Documents pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (3) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; (4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, (a) the Successor Company would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first sentence of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be greater than such ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; (5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, in which case clause (b) of the second succeeding paragraph shall apply, shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Persons obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the Registration Rights Agreement; (6) the Collateral owned by the Successor Company will (a) continue to constitute Collateral under the Indenture and the Security Documents, (b) be subject to a Lien in favor of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and (c) not be subject to any other Lien, other than Permitted Liens; (7) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged or consolidated with or into the Successor Company are assets of the type which would constitute Collateral under the Security Documents, the Successor Company will take such action as may be reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to be made subject to the Lien of the Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required in the Indenture or any of the Security Documents and shall take all reasonably necessary action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the Security Documents; and 149 Table of Contents (8) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture and, if a supplemental indenture or any supplement to any Security Document is required in connection with such transaction, such supplement shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture. The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for the Issuer, as the case may be, under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Notes, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (1) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with or merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer, and (2) the Issuer may merge with an Affiliate of the Issuer, as the case may be, solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in a State of the United States or any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor will, and the Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer or Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability corporation or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, as the case may be, or the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the Successor Person); (b) the Successor Person, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantors related Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (c) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; and (d) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture; or (2) the transaction is made in compliance with the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantors Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantor may (i) merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or the Issuer, (ii) merge with an Affiliate of the Company solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Guarantor in the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof or (iii) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability corporation or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor. Transactions with Affiliates The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or 150 Table of Contents guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an Affiliate Transaction ) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $40.0 million, unless: (1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arms-length basis; and (2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $80.0 million, a resolution adopted by the majority of the board of directors of the Issuer approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officers Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above. The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following: (1) transactions between or among the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the covenant  Limitation on Restricted Payments and the definition of Permitted Investments;

(6) any agreement as in effect as of the Issue Date, or any amendment thereto (so long as any such amendment is not disadvantageous to the Holders when taken as a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date);

provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders when taken as a whole; (8) [reserved]; (9) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture which are fair to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the board of directors of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries on its Capital Stock or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or (b) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, except (in each case) for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (a) contractual encumbrances or restrictions in effect on the Issue Date, including pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities and the related documentation, the Existing Notes Indenture and the related documentation and the 2006 Notes Indenture and the related documentation; (b) the Indenture and the Notes; (c) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the nature discussed in clause (3) above on the property so acquired; 152 Table of Contents (d) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order; (e) any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in existence at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired; (f) contracts for the sale of assets, including customary restrictions with respect to a Subsidiary of the Issuer pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of such Subsidiary; (g) Secured Indebtedness that limits the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness that is otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenants described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and  Liens; (h) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business; (i) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (j) customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other agreements or arrangements relating solely to such joint venture; (k) customary provisions contained in leases or licenses of intellectual property and other agreements, in each case entered into in the ordinary course of business; (l) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (k) above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no more restrictive with respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing; and (m) restrictions created in connection with any Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect the transactions contemplated under such Receivables Facility. Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor), other than a Guarantor, a Foreign Subsidiary or a Receivables Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any other Guarantor unless: (1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor: (a) if the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Guarantee under the supplemental indenture shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiarys guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness substantially to the same extent as the Notes are subordinated to such Indebtedness; and 153 Table of Contents (b) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and (2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives, and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee; provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to (i) any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) guarantees of the ABL Facility by the ABL Financing Entities or of any Receivables Facility by any Receivables Subsidiary. Reports and Other Information Notwithstanding that the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Indenture requires the Issuer to file with the SEC (and make available to the Trustee and Holders of the Notes (without exhibits), without cost to any Holder, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC) from and after the Issue Date, (1) within 90 days (or any other time period then in effect under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act with respect to the filing of a Form 10-K by a non-accelerated filer) after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form, containing the information required to be contained therein, or required in such successor or comparable form; (2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports on Form 10-Q containing all quarterly information that would be required to be contained in Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form; (3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other reports on Form 8-K, or any successor or comparable form; and (4) any other information, documents and other reports which the Issuer would be required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; in each case in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form; provided that the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Issuer will make available such information to prospective purchasers of Notes, in addition to providing such information to the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, in each case within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer has agreed that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer becomes a Guarantor of the Notes, the Indenture permits the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to such parent; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such requirements shall be deemed satisfied prior to the commencement of the exchange offer or the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement described in the Registration Rights Agreement (1) by the filing with the SEC of the exchange offer registration statement or shelf 154 Table of Contents registration statement (or any other similar registration statement), and any amendments thereto, with such financial information that satisfies Regulation S-X, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in the Offering Memorandum, to the extent filed within the times specified above, or (2) by posting reports that would be required to be filed substantially in the form required by the SEC on the Companys website (or that of any of its parent companies) or providing such reports to the Trustee within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the financial information (including a Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section) that would be required to be included in such reports, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in the Offering Memorandum, to the extent filed within the times specified above. Events of Default and Remedies The Indenture provides that each of the following is an Event of Default : (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest or Additional Interest on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less 30% in principal amount of the Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $200.0 million or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $200.0 million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary; (7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, as the case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture; or 155 Table of Contents (8) with respect to any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of $200 million, individually or in the aggregate, (a) the security interest under the Security Documents, at any time, ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, (b) any security interest created thereunder or under the Indenture is declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or (c) the Issuer or any Guarantor asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders of the Notes. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. 156 Table of Contents Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within five Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default. No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies (other than the Issuer and the Guarantors) shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting the Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

Senior Secured Notes Issued Under the 2009 First Lien Indenture HCA Inc. has issued senior secured notes as described below under an indenture, dated as of April 22, 2009, among the Issuer, the Guarantors, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, paying agent, registrar and transfer agent and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee. Terms used in this  Senior Secured Notes Issued Under the 2009 First Lien Indenture apply only to the Notes described herein. General Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading Certain Definitions.  In this description, the terms we, our, us and the Company each refer to HCA Inc. (the Issuer ) and its consolidated Subsidiaries. The Issuer issued $1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8 1 / 2 % senior secured notes due 2019 (the Notes ) under an indenture to be dated as of the closing date of the offering of the Notes (the Indenture ) among the Issuer, the Guarantors and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee (the Trustee ), Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent and Bank of America, N.A., as collateral agent. The Notes were issued in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of those agreements, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, and not this description, will define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Brief Description of Notes The Notes:  are general senior obligations of the Issuer;  are secured on a first-priority basis, equally and ratably with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under any existing and future First Lien Obligations, by all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors which secure the General Credit Facility (other than the European Collateral), subject to the Liens securing the Issuers and the Guarantors ABL Obligations and other Permitted Liens;  are secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under any existing and future First Lien Obligations, by all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors securing the ABL Facility which also secure the General Credit Facility, subject to the Liens securing the Issuers and the Guarantors ABL Obligations and other Permitted Liens; 187 Table of Contents  are effectively subordinated to the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the Shared Receivables Collateral;  are effectively subordinated to any obligations secured by Permitted Liens, to the extent of the value of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors subject to those Permitted Liens;  are structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including the ABL Financing Entities and the Issuers Foreign Subsidiaries and any Unrestricted Subsidiaries and including indebtedness under the Companys senior secured European term loan facility included in the General Credit Facility;  rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors but, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, are effectively senior to all of the Issuers and the Guarantors unsecured senior Indebtedness (including the Existing Notes) and Junior Lien Obligations (including the Existing Second Priority Notes);  are senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined with respect to the Notes) of the Issuer;  are initially unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several and senior basis by each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the General Credit Facility (other than any Foreign Subsidiary); and  are subject to registration with the SEC pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Guarantees The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest in respect of the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture. The Restricted Subsidiaries which guarantee the General Credit Facility guarantee the Notes. Each of the Guarantees of the Notes is a general senior obligation of each Guarantor and is secured by a first-priority lien on all of the assets of each Guarantor which secure the General Credit Facility (other than the European Collateral) and by a second-priority lien on all of the assets of each Guarantor which secure the ABL Facility. The Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor but, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, are effectively senior to all of the Guarantors unsecured senior Indebtedness and Junior Lien Obligations and, to the extent of the Shared Receivables Collateral, are effectively subordinated to the Guarantors Obligations under the ABL Facility and any future ABL Obligations. The Guarantees are senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of each Guarantor. The Notes are structurally subordinated to Indebtedness and other liabilities of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the Notes. Not all of the Issuers Subsidiaries Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. None of our Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Existing Notes Indenture, Foreign Subsidiaries, ABL Financing Entities, non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to our offering of $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien notes in April 2009 and the use of proceeds therefrom, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for approximately $11.867 billion, or 41.8%, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.038 billion, or 40.9%, of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2009, approximately $9.876 billion, or 40.7%, of our total assets, and approximately $7.517 billion, or 22.5%, of our total liabilities, in each case, as of December 31, 2008, and approximately $9.817 billion, or 40.4%, of 188 Table of Contents our total assets, and approximately $7.224 billion, or 21.9%, of our total liabilities, in each case, as of March 31, 2009. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. Any entity that makes a payment under its Guarantee is entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantors liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Notes  Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes, and with respect to the senior secured notes, the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payment on the notes. Each Guarantee by a Guarantor provides by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: 1. (a) any sale, exchange or transfer (by merger or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor, which sale, exchange or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of the Senior Credit Facilities or such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee; the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; or the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or the discharge of the Issuers obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; and 2. such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. Holding Company Structure The Issuer is a holding company for its Subsidiaries, with no material operations of its own and only limited assets. Accordingly, the Issuer is dependent upon the distribution of the earnings of its Subsidiaries, whether in the form of dividends, advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations, to service its debt obligations. Security General The Notes and the Guarantees are secured by perfected first-priority security interests in the Non-Receivables Collateral and by perfected second-priority security interests in the Shared Receivables Collateral (second in priority to the first-priority Liens on the Shared Receivables Collateral securing the ABL Obligations), in each case, subject to Permitted Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Notes nor the Guarantees are secured by the European Collateral or the Separate Receivables Collateral. The ABL Secured Parties have rights and remedies with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Shared Receivables Collateral or the ability of the respective agents 189 Table of Contents under the Intercreditor Agreements to realize or foreclose on the Shared Receivables Collateral on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties. First Lien Secured Parties other than the Holders of the Notes have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could also adversely affect the value of the Collateral on behalf of the Holders of the Notes, particularly the rights described below under  First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Shared Receivables Collateral and the Non-Receivables Collateral, see Description of Other Indebtedness  Senior Secured Credit Facilities  Guarantee and Security. The Issuer and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which could share in the Collateral, including additional First Lien Obligations, additional ABL Obligations, additional Junior Lien Obligations and Obligations secured by Permitted Liens. The amount of such additional Obligations is and will be limited by the covenant described under Certain Covenants  Liens and the covenant described under Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. Under certain circumstances, the amount of any such additional Obligations could be significant. After-Acquired Collateral From and after the Issue Date and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, (a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset that would constitute Collateral to secure any First Lien Obligations (other than European Collateral and Separate Receivables Collateral), it must concurrently grant a first-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon such property as security for the Notes and (b) if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset that would constitute Shared Receivables Collateral to secure any ABL Obligations, it must concurrently grant a second-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon such property as security for the Notes. Liens with Respect to the Collateral The Issuer, the Guarantors and the First Lien Collateral Agent entered into Security Documents in connection with the General Credit Facility with respect to the Collateral defining the terms of the security interests that secure the General Credit Facility with respect to such Collateral and that also define the terms of the security interests that secure the Notes and the Guarantees with respect to such Collateral. These security interests secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Security Documents, as provided in the Security Documents. First Lien Intercreditor Agreement The Trustee and the First Lien Collateral Agent entered into a First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement ) with the Authorized Representative of the General Credit Facility Obligations with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, General Credit Facility and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien Collateral Agent is initially the collateral agent under the General Credit Facility. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the Applicable Authorized Representative has the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Common Collateral, and the Authorized Representatives of other Series of First Lien Obligations have no right to take actions with respect to the Common Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative is initially the administrative agent under the General Credit Facility, and the Trustee for the Holders, as Authorized Representative in respect of the Notes, has no rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The administrative agent under the General Credit Facility will remain the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of General Credit Facility Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such date, the Applicable Authorized Agent 190 Table of Contents Date ). After the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of the Series of Additional First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations, other than the General Credit Facility Obligations, with respect to the Common Collateral (the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative ). The Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date is the date that is 90 days (throughout which 90-day period the applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Lien Obligations, and (b) the First Lien Collateral Agents and each other Authorized Representatives receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the Indenture or other applicable indenture for that Series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the administrative agent under the General Credit Facility or the First Lien Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Common Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Common Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The Applicable Authorized Representative shall have the sole right to instruct the First Lien Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Common Collateral, (b) the First Lien Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Common Collateral from any representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative), and (c) no Authorized Representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will instruct the First Lien Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Common Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the First Lien Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Common Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the First Lien Collateral Agent, Applicable Authorized Representative or Controlling Secured Party. The Trustee and each other Authorized Representative will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the Holders (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Notes) other than pursuant to the First Lien Security Documents. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If a First Lien Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the First Lien Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Common Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Common Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party (or received pursuant to any other intercreditor agreement), as applicable, and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the First Lien Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among 191 Table of Contents the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the First Lien Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Common Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an Intervening Creditor ), the value of any Common Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Common Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the First Lien Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Common Collateral. In addition, none of the First Lien Secured Parties may seek to have any Common Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Common Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment to the First Lien Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (the DIP Financing ) to be provided by one or more lenders (the DIP Lenders ) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, each First Lien Secured Party will agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Common Collateral securing the same (the DIP Financing Liens ) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Common Collateral, unless any Controlling Secured Party, or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Common Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Common Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Common Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Common Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as; (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Common Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Lien Secured Parties as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; 192 Table of Contents provided that the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that shall not constitute Common Collateral; and provided , further , that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The First Lien Secured Parties acknowledge that the First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series. Additional General Intercreditor Agreement The First Lien Collateral Agent is a party to an Additional General Intercreditor Agreement dated as of the Issue Date, (as the same may be amended from time to time, the Additional General Intercreditor Agreement ), by and among the First Lien Collateral Agent, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and the trustees under the Existing Second Priority Notes Indentures, by which the Notes are given the same ranking and rights with respect to the Collateral as provided to the General Credit Facility under the General Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2006, by and among the First Lien Collateral Agent and the Junior Lien Collateral Agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Additional General Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the First-Lien Intercreditor Agreement, prior to the Discharge of New First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Collateral Agent, acting on behalf of the New First Lien Secured Parties, will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the Collateral will be enforced and will have the sole and exclusive right to manage, perform and enforce the terms of the Security Documents relating to the Collateral and to exercise and enforce all privileges, rights and remedies thereunder according to its direction, including to take or retake control or possession of such Collateral and to hold, prepare for sale, marshall, process, sell, lease, dispose of or liquidate such Collateral, including, without limitation, following the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent will not be permitted to enforce the security interests even if any event of default under an Existing Second Priority Notes Indenture has occurred and the Existing Second Priority Notes issued thereunder have been accelerated except (a) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, solely as necessary to file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations or (b) as necessary to take any action in order to prove, preserve, perfect or protect (but not enforce) its security interest and rights in, and the perfection and priority of its Lien on, the Collateral. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, has agreed pursuant to the Additional General Intercreditor Agreement that (a) it will not (and thereby waives any right to) take any action to challenge, contest or support any other Person in contesting or challenging, directly or indirectly, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of a Lien securing any New First Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the First Lien Collateral Agent or any of the New First Lien Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor in any Collateral or other collateral securing both the New First Lien Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations and (b) it will not oppose or otherwise contest (or support any other Person contesting) any request for judicial relief made in any court by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any New First Lien Secured Parties relating to the lawful enforcement of any First Priority Lien on Collateral or other collateral securing both the New First Lien Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations. In addition, the Security Documents provide that, subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, prior to the Discharge of New First Lien Obligations, the First Lien Collateral Agent may take actions with respect to the Collateral (including the release of Collateral and the manner of realization (subject to the provisions described under  Release of Collateral)) without the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or other Junior Lien Secured Parties. 193 Table of Contents The Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such Non-Receivables Collateral upon the exercise of remedies will be applied to the First Lien Obligations to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement prior to application to any Junior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant First Lien Documents until the Discharge of New First Lien Obligations has occurred. In addition, so long as the Discharge of New First Lien Obligations has not occurred, neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any Junior Lien Representative shall acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of the Issuer or any Subsidiary (and neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary shall grant such Lien) securing any Junior Lien Obligations that are not also subject to the First Priority Lien in respect of the New First Lien Obligations under the First Lien Documents. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Secured Party have agreed that any Lien purported to be granted on any collateral as security for New First Lien Obligations shall be deemed to be and shall be deemed to remain senior in all respects and prior to all Liens on such collateral securing any Junior Lien Obligations for all purposes regardless of whether the Lien purported to be granted is found to be improperly granted, improperly perfected, preferential, a fraudulent conveyance or legally or otherwise deficient in any manner. If any New First Lien Secured Party is required in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Issuer or any other Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be fraudulent or preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a Recovery ), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise, then as among the parties hereto, the New First Lien Obligations shall be deemed to be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and such New First Lien Secured Party shall be entitled to a reinstatement of New First Lien Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts and shall have all rights hereunder. If the Additional General Intercreditor Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the Additional General Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto. The Additional General Intercreditor Agreement provides that so long as the Discharge of New First Lien Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor, (i) neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative nor any Junior Lien Secured Party will (x) exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or the right to credit bid debt (except under limited circumstances)) with respect to any collateral securing both the New First Lien Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations in respect of any applicable Junior Lien Obligations, or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), (y) contest, protest or otherwise object to any foreclosure or enforcement proceeding or action brought with respect to the Collateral or any other collateral by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any New First Lien Secured Party in respect of the New First Lien Obligations, the exercise of any right by the First Lien Collateral Agent or any New First Lien Secured Party (or any agent or sub-agent on their behalf) in respect of the New First Lien Obligations under any control agreement, lockbox agreement, landlord waiver or bailees letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative or any Junior Lien Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third-party beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party of any rights and remedies as a secured party relating to such collateral or any other collateral under the First Lien Documents or otherwise in respect of New First Lien Obligations, or (z) object to any waiver or forbearance by the First Lien Secured Parties from or in respect of bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to such collateral or any other collateral in respect of New First Lien Obligations and (ii) except as otherwise provided in the Additional General Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the New First Lien Secured Parties shall have the sole and exclusive right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including setoff and the right to credit bid their debt), marshal, process and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions, or waiver or forbearance of rights or remedies 194 Table of Contents with respect to such collateral without any consultation with or the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, any Junior Lien Representative or any Junior Lien Secured Party. In addition, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, each Junior Lien Representative and each other Junior Lien Secured Party have agreed, among other things, that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding if the First Lien Collateral Agent, subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, desires to permit the use of cash collateral or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain financing under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision in any Bankruptcy Law ( DIP Financing ), including if such DIP Financing is secured by Liens senior in priority to the Liens securing the Junior Lien Obligations, then the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, agrees not to object to such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to the extent permitted by the Additional General Intercreditor Agreement) and, to the extent the Liens securing the new First Lien Obligations are subordinated or pari passu with such DIP Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral and any other collateral to such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as they are subordinated to the New First Lien Obligations. Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Obligations (other than securities, instruments and chattel paper constituting part of the Collateral and deposited with the First Lien Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Security Documents and any Shared Receivables Collateral subject to a control agreement under the circumstances described in the First Lien Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. Release of Collateral Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Common Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the First Lien Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and each other Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Common Collateral will automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Common Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described under  First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Additional Receivables Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Issuer or any Guarantor or any ABL Secured Party delivers notice that any Shared Receivables Collateral is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the owner of that Collateral in a transaction permitted under the ABL Facility, the General Credit Facility and the Indenture or the ABL Secured Parties are releasing or have released their Liens on such Shared Receivables Collateral in connection with a disposition in connection with an exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral, then the Liens on such Shared Receivables Collateral securing New First Lien Obligations or Junior Lien Obligations will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens on such Shared Receivables Collateral securing ABL Obligations are released and discharged, provided that in the case of a disposition in connection with an exercise of remedies, any proceeds thereof not applied to repay ABL Obligations shall be subject to the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations and the Junior Lien Obligations and shall be applied pursuant to the Additional Receivables Intercreditor Agreement and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The Issuer and the Guarantors are entitled to the release of property and other assets constituting Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes and the Notes Obligations under any one or more of the following circumstances: (1) to enable us to consummate the sale, transfer or other disposition of such property or assets to the extent not prohibited under the covenant described under  Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales; 195 Table of Contents (2) the release of Excess Proceeds or Collateral Excess Proceeds that remain unexpended after the conclusion of an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer conducted in accordance with the Indenture; (3) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor; (4) with the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and affected thereby and a majority of all Junior Lien Obligations (including the Existing Second Priority Notes) then outstanding and affected thereby (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, Junior Lien Obligations); or (5) as described under  Amendment, Supplement and Waiver below. To the extent necessary and for so long as required for such Subsidiary not to be subject to any requirement pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act to file separate financial statements with the SEC (or any other governmental agency), the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Company (excluding Healthtrust, Inc.  The Hospital Company, a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns) shall not be included in the Collateral with respect to the respective Notes so affected (as described under  Certain Limitations on the Collateral) and shall not be subject to the Liens securing such Notes and the Notes Obligations. The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees also will be released upon (i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any), are paid or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as described below under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or a discharge of the Indenture as described under Satisfaction and Discharge. Any certificate or opinion required by Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act may be made by an Officer of the Company, except in cases where Section 314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent engineer, appraiser or other expert. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will not be required to comply with all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act if they determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of that section and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff, including no action letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act is inapplicable to the released Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, certain no action letters issued by the SEC have permitted an indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act to contain provisions permitting the release of collateral from Liens under such indenture in the ordinary course of the issuers business without requiring the issuer to provide certificates and other documents under Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture Act. The Issuer and the Guarantors may, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, among other things, without any release or consent by the First Lien Collateral Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation:  selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien of the Security Documents that has become worn out, defective, obsolete or not used or useful in the business;  abandoning, terminating, canceling, releasing or making alterations in or substitutions of any leases or contracts subject to the Lien of the Indenture or any of the Security Documents;  surrendering or modifying any franchise, license or permit subject to the Lien of the Security Documents that it may own or under which it may be operating; 196 Table of Contents  altering, repairing, replacing, changing the location or position of and adding to its structures, machinery, systems, equipment, fixtures and appurtenances;  granting a license of any intellectual property;  selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of inventory in the ordinary course of business;  collecting accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business as permitted by the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales;  making cash payments (including for the repayment of Indebtedness or interest) from cash that is at any time part of the Collateral in the ordinary course of business that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture and the Security Documents; and  abandoning any intellectual property that is no longer used or useful in the Issuers business. The Issuer must deliver an Officers Certificate to the First Lien Collateral Agent within 30 calendar days following the end of each six-month period beginning on May 15 and November 15 of each year, to the effect that all such releases and withdrawals during the preceding six-month period in the ordinary course of the Issuers or the Guarantors business, as described in the preceding paragraph, were not prohibited by the Indenture. Additional Receivables Intercreditor Agreement In addition, the First Lien Collateral Agent is a party to an Additional Receivables Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of the Issue Date, (as the same may be amended from time to time, the Additional Receivables Intercreditor Agreement ), by and between the First Lien Collateral Agent and the collateral agent under the ABL Facility (the ABL Collateral Agent ), by which the Notes are given the same ranking and rights with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral as provided to the General Credit Facility under the Receivables Intercreditor Agreement dated as of November 17, 2006 by and among the Junior Lien Collateral Agent, the First Lien Collateral Agent and the ABL Collateral Agent. The Additional Receivables Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral and the relative rights, privileges and obligations relating thereto as between (a) the First Lien Collateral Agent and the New First Lien Secured Parties and (b) the ABL Collateral Agent and the ABL Secured Parties. The Additional Receivables Intercreditor Agreement provides for first-priority Liens in the Shared Receivables Collateral in favor of the ABL Secured Parties and junior priority Liens in the Shared Receivables Collateral in favor of the New First Lien Secured Parties, subject to Permitted Liens. The relative rights, privileges and obligations with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral of the ABL Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the New First Lien Secured Parties, on the other, are substantially similar to the relative rights, privileges and obligations with respect to the Non-Receivables Collateral of the New First Lien Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Junior Lien Secured Parties, on the other, respectively, except that the Liens of the New First Lien Secured Parties in the Shared Receivables Collateral are second-priority Liens and the Liens of the ABL Secured Parties in the Shared Receivables Collateral are first-priority liens and except to the extent customary or necessary with respect to collateral of the type that constitutes Shared Receivables Collateral. The relative rights, privileges and obligations with respect to the Shared Receivables Collateral (a) as between the First Lien Collateral Agent and the First Lien Secured Parties, on the one hand, and the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and the Junior Lien Secured Parties, on the other, are governed by the Additional General Intercreditor Agreement described above and (b) as among the First Lien Secured Parties, are governed by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement described above. Certain Limitations on the Collateral The Collateral securing the Notes does not include any of the following assets: (1) the property or assets owned by any Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor, including each ABL Financing Entity; 197 Table of Contents (2) any rights or interests of the Issuer or any Guarantor in, to or under any agreement, contract, license, instrument, document or other general intangible (referred to solely for purposes of this clause (2) as a Contract ), any intellectual property or any security or other investment property (i) to the extent the security interest in such Collateral is prohibited by any applicable contract, agreement or other instrument without the consent of any other party thereto (other than a party to the General Credit Facility or the Indenture or, in the case of investment property, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary), (ii) to the extent the security interest in such Contract would give any other party (other than a party to the General Credit Facility or the Indenture or, in the case of investment property, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) to such Collateral the right to terminate its obligations thereunder or (iii) to the extent all necessary consents to such grant of a security interest have not been obtained from the other parties thereto (other than to the extent that any such prohibition referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law); provided that this limitation shall not affect, limit, restrict or impair the grant by the Issuer or such Guarantor of a security interest in any account receivable or any money or other amounts due or to become due under any Contract; (3) any equipment of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is subject to, or secured by, a Capitalized Lease Obligation or Purchase Money Obligations and any equipment that constitutes an asset of an entity acquired in a transaction permitted by the Indenture to the extent that such equipment subject to a Lien permitted by the Indenture and the terms of the Indebtedness secured by such Lien prohibit assignment of, or granting of a security interest in, the Issuers or such Guarantors rights and interests therein (other than to the extent that any such prohibition would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law); provided that immediately upon the repayment of all Indebtedness secured by such Lien, the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have granted a security interest in all the rights and interests with respect to such equipment; (4) any Voting Stock that is issued by any Foreign Subsidiary, if and to the extent that the inclusion of such Voting Stock in the Collateral would cause the Collateral pledged by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, to include in the aggregate more than 65% of the total combined voting power of all classes of Voting Stock of such Foreign Subsidiary; (5) any Capital Stock that is issued by a Subsidiary that is not owned directly by the Issuer or a Guarantor; (6) any Capital Stock and other securities of a Subsidiary (excluding Healthtrust, Inc.  The Hospital Company, a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns) to the extent that the pledge of such Capital Stock and other securities results in the Companys being required to file separate financial statements of such Subsidiary with the SEC, but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as such requirement is in existence and only with respect to the relevant Notes affected; provided that neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary shall take any action in the form of a reorganization, merger or other restructuring a principal purpose of which is to provide for the release of the Lien on any Capital Stock pursuant to this clause (6). In addition, in the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Subsidiary of the Company (excluding Healthtrust, Inc.  The Hospital Company, a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns) due to the fact that such Subsidiarys Capital Stock secures the Notes affected thereby, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral securing the relevant Notes affected thereby but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required to not be subject to such requirement. In such event, the Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder of such Notes, to the extent necessary to release the security interests in favor of the First Lien Collateral Agent on the shares of Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral for 198 Table of Contents the relevant Notes. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit) such Subsidiarys Capital Stock to secure the Notes in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed to be a part of the Collateral for the relevant Notes; (7) certain non-Principal Properties that do not constitute Non-Receivables Collateral; (8) any deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts or cash of the Issuer or any Guarantor; (9) any leaseholds and motor vehicles of the Issuer or any Guarantor; (10) any Capital Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Capital Stock (i) if, in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the cost or other consequences of pledging such Collateral shall be excessive in view of the benefits to be obtained by the First Lien Secured Parties therefrom or (ii) the pledge of such Collateral would result in adverse tax consequences to the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries as reasonably determined by the Issuer and identified in writing to the First Lien Collateral Agent; (11) any collateral to the extent the grant of the security interest therein would violate any requirement of law; and (12) proceeds and products from any and all of the foregoing excluded collateral described in clauses (1) through (11), unless such proceeds or products would otherwise constitute Collateral securing the Notes. Sufficiency of Collateral The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of the health care industry, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, the ability of the holders to realize upon any of the Collateral may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations as described below. Certain Bankruptcy Limitations The right of the Trustee to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired by any Bankruptcy Law in the event that a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against the Company or any Guarantor prior to the Trustees having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Trustee is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security without bankruptcy court approval. In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the Trustee could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys fees to a secured creditor during a debtors bankruptcy case to the extent the value of such creditors interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders of the Notes would hold secured 199 Table of Contents claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes The Issuer must maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The initial paying agent for the Notes is Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. The Issuer must also maintain a registrar with offices in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The initial registrar is Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. The registrar maintains a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar. Transfer and Exchange A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. Principal, Maturity and Interest The Issuer issued $1,500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2019. Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, the Issuer may issue additional Notes, from time to time after this offering under the Indenture (any such Notes, Additional Notes ). Except as described under Amendment, Supplement and Waiver, the Notes of the Issuer and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Notes for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of Notes include any Additional Notes that are actually issued. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 8 1 / 2 % per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 commencing October 15, 2009, to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding April 1 and October 1. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Additional Interest Additional Interest may accrue on the Notes in certain circumstances pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. All references in the Indenture, in any context, to any interest or other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes shall be deemed to include any Additional Interest pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes is payable at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose within the City and State of New York or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuers office or agency in New York will be the office of the Registrar and Paying Agent maintained for such purpose. 200 Table of Contents Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption Repurchase at the Option of Holders. The Issuer may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below, the Issuer is not entitled to redeem Notes at its option prior to April 15, 2014. At any time prior to April 15, 2014, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of redemption (the Redemption Date ), subject to the rights of Holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. On and after April 15, 2014 the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on April 15 of each of the years indicated below: Year Percentage 2014 104.250 % 2015 102.833 % 2016 101.417 % 2017 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, until April 15, 2012, the Issuer may, at its option, on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes at a redemption price equal to 108.500% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that at least 50% of the sum of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture and the original principal amount of any Additional Notes that are Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption; provided further that each such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering. Any notice of any redemption may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering or other corporate transaction. If the Issuer redeems less than all of the outstanding Notes, the Registrar and Paying Agent shall select the Notes to be redeemed in the manner described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Selection and Notice. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control The Notes provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under Optional Redemption, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below 201 Table of Contents (the Change of Control Offer ) at a price in cash (the Change of Control Payment ) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee and the Registrar, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register with a copy to the Trustee and the Registrar or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled Change of Control and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the Change of Control Payment Date ); (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled Option of Holder to Elect Purchase on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the 30th day following the date of the Change of Control notice, a telegram, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) that if the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes, the Holders of the remaining Notes will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and (8) the other instructions, as determined by us, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder must follow. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and 202 Table of Contents (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Senior Credit Facilities, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our Senior Credit Facilities. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Facilities, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities being declared due and payable and could cause a Receivables Facility to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. After the Issue Date, we have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain Covenants  Liens. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer is not required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. 203 Table of Contents Asset Sales The Indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiarys most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which the Issuer and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all creditors in writing, (b) any securities received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale, and (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 5% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose. Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to permanently reduce: (a) Obligations constituting First Lien Obligations (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto) ( provided that (x) to the extent that the terms of First Lien Obligations other than Obligations under the Notes require that such First Lien Obligations are repaid with the Net Proceeds of Asset Sales prior to repayment of other Indebtedness, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be entitled to repay such other First Lien Obligations prior to repaying the Obligations under the Notes and (y) subject to the foregoing clause (x), if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall so reduce First Lien Obligations, the Issuer will equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes through open-market purchases ( provided that such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the pro rata principal amount of Notes); (b) Obligations under the Existing Notes which have a final maturity date (as in effect on the Issue Date) on or prior to the maturity date of the Notes; provided that, at the time of, and after giving effect to, such repurchase, redemption or defeasance, the aggregate amount of Net Proceeds used to repurchase, redeem or defease Existing Notes pursuant to this subclause (b) following the Issue Date shall not exceed 5% of the consolidated total assets of the Issuer and is subsidiaries at such time; or (c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (or any affiliate thereof); 204 Table of Contents (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business; or (3) to make an investment in (a) any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided that, in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer, or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an Acceptable Commitment ) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a Second Commitment ) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided , further , that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of Collateral that are not invested or applied as set forth in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute Collateral Excess Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required by the terms of any First Lien Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral), to the holders of such First Lien Obligations or such other Obligations (a Collateral Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such First Lien Obligations or such other Obligations that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Collateral Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence a Collateral Asset Sale Offer with respect to Collateral Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Collateral Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of non-Collateral that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of the second preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Senior Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (an Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such other First Lien Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted by the Indenture (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral) tendered pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer is less than the Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such 205 Table of Contents Senior Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or other First Lien Obligations or such other Obligations surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other First Lien Obligations or such other Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such other First Lien Obligations or such other Obligations tendered. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Senior Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Senior Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of any such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds or Excess Proceeds, as the case may be, shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer using proceeds from any Asset Sale at any time after consummation of such Asset Sale; provided that such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $50.0 million. Upon consummation of such Collateral Asset Sale Offer or Asset Sale Offer, any Net Proceeds not required to be used to purchase Notes shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Selection and Notice If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes issued by it at any time, the Registrar and Paying Agent will select the Notes to be redeemed (a) if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes are listed, (b) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable or (c) by lot or such other similar method in accordance with the procedures of DTC. Notices of purchase or redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes at such Holders registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. The Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. Certain Covenants Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a Covenant Suspension Event ), the Issuer and the 206 Table of Contents Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants (collectively, the Suspended Covenants ): (1) Repurchase at the Option of Holders; (2)  Limitation on Restricted Payments; (3)  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of  Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets; (5)  Transactions with Affiliates; and (6)  Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries. In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the Reversion Date ) one or both of the Rating Agencies (a) withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating and/or (b) the Issuer or any of its Affiliates enters into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating Agencies indicate that if consummated, such transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or refinancing transactions) would cause such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the ratings assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events, including, without limitation, a proposed transaction described in clause (b) above. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Proceeds shall be reset at zero. In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indentures with respect to Notes; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption  Limitation on Restricted Payments had been in effect prior to, but not during the Suspension Period, provided that any Subsidiaries designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period shall automatically become Restricted Subsidiaries on the Reversion Date (subject to the Issuers right to subsequently designate them as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in compliance with the covenants set out below), and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings. Limitation on Restricted Payments The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuers, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger or consolidation other than: (a) dividends or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer; or (b) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted 207 Table of Contents Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities; (II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, including in connection with any merger or consolidation; (III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness, other than: (a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; or (b) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase or acquisition; or (IV) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exception thereto) being collectively referred to as Restricted Payments ), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment: (1) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first paragraph of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; and (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after November 17, 2006 (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1), (2) (with respect to the payment of dividends on Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below) pursuant to clause (b) thereof only), (6)(c), (9) and (14) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without duplication): (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning October 1, 2006, to the end of the Issuers most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; plus (b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received by the Issuer since immediately after November 17, 2006 (other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock) from the issue or sale of: (i) (A) Equity Interests of the Issuer, including Treasury Capital Stock (as defined below), but excluding cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received from the sale of: (x) Equity Interests to members of management, directors or consultants of the Issuer, any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer and the Issuers Subsidiaries after 208 Table of Contents November 17, 2006 to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph; and (y) Designated Preferred Stock; and (B) to the extent such net cash proceeds are actually contributed to the Issuer, Equity Interests of the Issuers direct or indirect parent companies (excluding contributions of the proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock of such companies or contributions to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph); or (ii) debt securities of the Issuer that have been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests of the Issuer; provided , however , that this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (V) Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below), (W) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of the Issuer sold to a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, (X) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock, (Y) Excluded Contributions or (Z) the Delayed Equity Amount; plus (c) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property contributed to the capital of the Issuer following November 17, 2006 (other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds (i) have been used to incur Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, (ii) are contributed by a Restricted Subsidiary, (iii) constitute Excluded Contributions or (iv) constitute the Delayed Equity Amount); plus (d) 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of marketable securities or other property received by means of: (i) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repayments of loans or advances, and releases of guarantees, which constitute Restricted Investments by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after November 17, 2006; or (ii) the sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than in each case to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment) or a dividend from an Unrestricted Subsidiary after November 17, 2006; plus (e) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary after November 17, 2006, the fair market value of the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, as determined by the Issuer in good faith (or if such fair market value exceeds $250.0 million, in writing by an Independent Financial Advisor), at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary other than to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment. The foregoing provisions will not prohibit: (1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at the date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture; 209 Table of Contents (2) (a) the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of any Equity Interests (Treasury Capital Stock) or Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Equity Interests of any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer, in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of, Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer to the extent contributed to the Issuer (in each case, other than any Disqualified Stock) (Refunding Capital Stock) and (b) if immediately prior to the retirement of Treasury Capital Stock, the declaration and payment of dividends thereon was permitted under clause (6) of this paragraph, the declaration and payment of dividends on the Refunding Capital Stock (other than Refunding Capital Stock the proceeds of which were used to redeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any Equity Interests of any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer) in an aggregate amount per year no greater than the aggregate amount of dividends per annum that were declarable and payable on such Treasury Capital Stock immediately prior to such retirement;

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor will, and the Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer or Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability corporation or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, as the case may be, or the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the Successor Person ); (b) the Successor Person, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantors related Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (c) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; and (d) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture; or (2) the transaction is made in compliance with the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders  Asset Sales. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantors Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantor may (i) merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or the Issuer, (ii) merge with an Affiliate of the Company solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Guarantor in the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof or (iii) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability corporation or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor. Transactions with Affiliates The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an Affiliate Transaction ) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $40.0 million, unless: (1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arms-length basis; and 220 Table of Contents (2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $80.0 million, a resolution adopted by the majority of the board of directors of the Issuer approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officers Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above. The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following: (1) transactions between or among the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the covenant  Limitation on Restricted Payments and the definition of Permitted Investments;

provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders when taken as a whole; (8) reserved; (9) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture which are fair to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the board of directors of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries on its Capital Stock or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or (b) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, except (in each case) for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (a) contractual encumbrances or restrictions in effect on the Issue Date, including pursuant to the Senior Credit Facilities and the related documentation, the Existing Notes Indenture and the related documentation and the Existing Second Priority Notes Indentures and the related documentation; (b) the Indenture and the Notes; (c) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the nature discussed in clause (3) above on the property so acquired; (d) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order; 222 Table of Contents (e) any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in existence at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired; (f) contracts for the sale of assets, including customary restrictions with respect to a Subsidiary of the Issuer pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of such Subsidiary; (g) Secured Indebtedness that limits the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness that is otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenants described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and  Liens; (h) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business; (i) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (j) customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other agreements or arrangements relating solely to such joint venture; (k) customary provisions contained in leases or licenses of intellectual property and other agreements, in each case entered into in the ordinary course of business; (l) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (k) above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no more restrictive with respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing; and (m) restrictions created in connection with any Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect the transactions contemplated under such Receivables Facility. Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor), other than a Guarantor, a Foreign Subsidiary or a Receivables Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any other Guarantor unless: (1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor: (a) if the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Guarantee under the supplemental indenture shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiarys guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness substantially to the same extent as the Notes are subordinated to such Indebtedness; and (b) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to 223 Table of Contents such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and (2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives, and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee; provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to (i) any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) guarantees of the ABL Facility by the ABL Financing Entities or of any Receivables Facility by any Receivables Subsidiary. Reports and Other Information Notwithstanding that the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Indenture requires the Issuer to file with the SEC (and make available to the Trustee and Holders of the Notes (without exhibits), without cost to any Holder, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC) from and after the Issue Date, (1) within 90 days (or any other time period then in effect under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act with respect to the filing of a Form 10-K by a non-accelerated filer) after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form, containing the information required to be contained therein, or required in such successor or comparable form; (2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports on Form 10-Q containing all quarterly information that would be required to be contained in Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form; (3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other reports on Form 8-K, or any successor or comparable form; and (4) any other information, documents and other reports which the Issuer would be required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; in each case in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form; provided that the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Issuer will make available such information to prospective purchasers of Notes, in addition to providing such information to the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, in each case within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer has agreed that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer becomes a Guarantor of the Notes, the Indenture permits the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to such parent; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such requirements shall be deemed satisfied prior to the commencement of the exchange offer or the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement described in the Registration Rights Agreement (1) by the filing with the SEC of the exchange offer registration statement or shelf registration statement (or any other similar registration statement), and any amendments thereto, with such financial information that satisfies Regulation S-X, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of 224 Table of Contents financial information in the Offering Memorandum, to the extent filed within the times specified above, or (2) by posting reports that would be required to be filed substantially in the form required by the SEC on the Companys website (or that of any of its parent companies) or providing such reports to the Trustee within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the financial information (including a Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section) that would be required to be included in such reports, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in the Offering Memorandum, to the extent filed within the times specified above. Events of Default and Remedies The Indenture provides that each of the following is an Event of Default : (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest or Additional Interest on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $200.0 million or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $200.0 million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary; (7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, as the case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture; or (8) with respect to any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of $200 million, individually or in the aggregate, (a) the security interest under the Security Documents, at any time, ceases to be in 225 Table of Contents full force and effect for any reason other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, (b) any security interest created thereunder or under the Indenture is declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or (c) the Issuer or any Guarantor asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders of the Notes. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The 226 Table of Contents Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within five Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default. No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies (other than the Issuer and the Guarantors) shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting the Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes and have the Issuers and each Guarantors obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (Legal Defeasance ) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for: (1) the rights of Holders of the Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture; (2) the Issuers obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust; (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers obligations in connection therewith; and (4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

We have deposited each global security with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company (DTC), as depositary, or its nominee and registered it in the name of a nominee of DTC. Except under the limited circumstances described below, global securities are not exchangeable for certificated securities. Only institutions that have accounts with DTC or its nominee (participants) or persons that may hold interests through participants may own beneficial interests in a global security. DTC will maintain records evidencing ownership by participants in the global securities and transfers of those ownership interests. Participants maintain records evidencing ownership of beneficial interests in the global securities by persons that hold through those participants and transfers of those ownership interests within those participants. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the securities. You will not receive written confirmation from DTC of your purchase, but we do expect that you will receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of your holdings from the participant through which you entered the transaction. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in certificated form. Those laws may impair your ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security. DTC has advised us that upon the issuance of a global security and the deposit of that global security with DTC, DTC will immediately credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amounts or number of shares represented by that global security to the accounts of its participants. We will make payments on securities represented by a global security to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the global security representing those securities. DTC has advised us that upon receipt of any payment on a global security, DTC will immediately credit accounts of participants with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in that security, as shown in the records of DTC. Standing instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through those participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in street name. Those payments will be the sole responsibility of those participants, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect from time to time. Neither we, the trustees, the agents nor any agent of ours or theirs will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records of DTC, any nominee or any participant relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial interests in a global security, for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the records of DTC, any nominee or any participant relating to those beneficial interests or for any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC, any nominee or any participant. A global security is exchangeable for certificated securities registered in the name of a person other than DTC or its nominee only if:  DTC (1) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for that global security or (2) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, in either case, we fail to appoint a successor depository;  we, in our discretion at any time, determine not to require all of the notes of a particular series to be represented by a global security and so notify the applicable trustee; or  with respect to global securities representing any series of our senior secured notes, there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to such senior secured notes. In addition, beneficial interests in a global security may be exchanged for certificated securities upon prior written notice given to the applicable trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the applicable indenture. In all cases, certificated securities delivered in exchange for any global security or beneficial interests in global securities will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). 260 Table of Contents The registrar will register the certificated securities in the name or names instructed by DTC. We expect that those instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global security. In the case of global debt securities, we will make payment of any principal and interest on the certificated securities and will register transfers and exchanges of those certificated securities at the corporate trust office of the respective transfer agent and registrar in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. However, we may elect to pay interest by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to that interest payment as of the record date, as shown on the register for the securities. Except as provided above, as an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security, you will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of securities in certificated form and will not be considered a holder of securities for any purpose under the indentures. No global security will be exchangeable except for another global security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Accordingly, you must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participant through which you own your interest to exercise any rights of a holder under the global security or the applicable indenture. We understand that, under existing industry practices, in the event that we request any action of holders, or an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action that a holder is entitled to take under the securities or the indentures, DTC would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action, and those participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in deposited securities, such as transfers and pledges, through electronic computerized book-entry changes in accounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTCs participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its participants and by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to DTCs system is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC. Investors may elect to hold interests in securities outside the United States through Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (Clearstream) or Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (Euroclear), if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers securities accounts in Clearstreams and Euroclears names on the books of their respective depositaries. Those depositaries in turn hold those interests in customers securities accounts in the depositaries names on the books of DTC. Clearstream has advised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a bank. Clearstream holds securities for its customers and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its customers through electronic book-entry changes in their accounts. Clearstream provides to its customers, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic securities markets in over 30 countries through established depository and custodial relationships. As a bank, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector, also known as the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier and the Luxembourg Central Bank. Clearstream customers are financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. Its customers in the United States are limited to securities brokers and dealers and banks. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to other institutions such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with the customer. 261 Table of Contents Distributions with respect to global securities held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream customers in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Clearstream. Euroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear provides various other services, including securities lending and borrowing, and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C. establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear participants. Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly. Distributions with respect to interests in global securities held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with Euroclears terms and conditions and operating procedures and applicable Belgian law, to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Euroclear. Global Clearance and Settlement Procedures Unless otherwise specified with respect to a particular series of global securities, initial settlement for global securities will be made in immediately available funds. Transfers between DTC participants will be effected under DTCs procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. If the interests in the global securities may be held through Clearstream or Euroclear, Clearstream customers and/or Euroclear participants will conduct secondary market trading with other Clearstream customers and/or Euroclear participants in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Thereafter, secondary market trades will settle in immediately available funds. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC participants on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTCs rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by the U.S. depositary for that system; however, those cross-market transactions will require delivery by the counterparty in the relevant European international clearing system of instructions to that system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the U.S. depositary for that system to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in global securities in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream customers and Euroclear participants may not deliver instructions directly to DTC. Because of time-zone differences, credits of interests in global securities received by Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and will be credited the business day following the DTC settlement date. Those credits or any transactions in global securities settled during that processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear participants or Clearstream customers on that business day. Cash received by Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of interests in global securities by or through a Clearstream customer or a Euroclear participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC. Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the procedures described above in order to facilitate transfers of interests in global securities among participants of DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures and those procedures may be discontinued at any time. 262 Table of Contents CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income and, in the case of non-U.S. holders (as defined below), estate tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes as of the date of this prospectus. Unless otherwise stated, this summary deals only with notes held as capital assets. For purposes of this discussion, toggle notes means the 9 5 / 8 %/10 3 / 8 % senior secured toggle notes due 2016, cash-pay OID notes means the 9 7 / 8 % second lien senior secured notes due 2017 and the 8 1 / 2 % first lien senior secured notes due 2019, and cash-pay notes means notes other than the toggle notes and cash-pay OID notes. As used herein, a U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of the notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes any of the following:  an individual citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. The term non-U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of the notes (other than a partnership or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:  a dealer in securities or currencies;  a financial institution;  a regulated investment company;  a real estate investment trust;  a tax-exempt organization;  an insurance company;  a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle;  a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;  a person liable for alternative minimum tax;  a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or an investor in such entities);  a U.S. holder whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;  a controlled foreign corporation;  a passive foreign investment company; or  a United States expatriate. This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may 263 Table of Contents be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes that are different from those discussed below. If a partnership (including any entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership holding notes, you should consult your own tax advisors. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the effects of any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular purchaser of notes. You should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the ownership of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. Certain Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to U.S. holders of the notes. Cash-Pay Notes Stated Interest on Cash-Pay Notes. Stated interest on a cash-pay note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Market Discount. If you purchase a cash-pay note for an amount that is less than its principal amount, the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless that difference is less than a specified de minimis amount. Under the market discount rules, you will be required to treat any principal payment on, or any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of, a cash-pay note as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that you have not previously included in income and are treated as having accrued on the note at the time of the payment or disposition. In addition, you may be required to defer, until the maturity of the cash-pay note or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction, the deduction of all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness attributable to the note. You may elect, on a note-by-note basis, to deduct the deferred interest expense in a tax year prior to the year of disposition. You should consult your own tax advisors before making this election. Any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the cash-pay note, unless you elect to accrue on a constant interest method. You may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues, on either a ratable or constant interest method, in which case the rule described above regarding deferral of interest deductions will not apply. Amortizable Bond Premium. If you purchase a cash-pay note for an amount in excess of its principal amount, you will be considered to have purchased the cash-pay note at a premium. You generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of the cash-pay note on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under your regular accounting method. If you do not elect to amortize bond premium, that premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss you would otherwise recognize on disposition of the cash-pay note. Sale, Exchange, Retirement, or Other Taxable Disposition of Cash-Pay Notes. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition of a cash-pay note, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other 264 Table of Contents disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above) and the adjusted tax basis of the cash-pay note. Your adjusted tax basis in a cash-pay note will, in general, be your cost for that cash-pay note, increased by any market discount previously included in income, and reduced by any amortized premium. Except as described above with respect to market discount, any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Cash-Pay OID Notes Stated Interest on Cash-Pay OID Notes. Stated interest on a cash-pay OID note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Original Issue Discount. The cash-pay OID notes are treated as having been issued with original issue discount (OID) in an amount equal to the difference between their stated redemption price at maturity (the sum of all payments to be made on the cash-pay OID notes other than qualified stated interest) and their issue price. The issue price of a cash-pay OID note is the first price at which a substantial amount of that particular offering of the cash-pay OID notes was sold (excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwiter, placement agent or wholesaler). The term qualified stated interest means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than debt instruments of the issuer) at least annually at a single fixed rate or, subject to certain conditions, based on one or more interest indices. The stated interest payments on the cash-pay OID notes are qualified stated interest, and are treated as described above under  Stated Interest on Cash-Pay OID Notes. You generally must include OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income using the constant yield method described in the following paragraphs. The amount of OID that you must include in income each year is the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the cash-pay OID note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which you held that cash-pay OID note (accrued OID). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The accrual period for a cash-pay OID note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the cash-pay OID note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of:  the product of the cash-pay OID notes adjusted issue price at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period), over  the aggregate of all qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. The yield to maturity of the cash-pay OID note is the discount rate that causes the present value of all payments on the note as of its original issue date to equal the issue price of such note. The adjusted issue price of a cash-pay OID note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period, determined without regard to the amortization of any acquisition or bond premium, as described below. You may elect to treat all interest on a cash-pay OID note as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the constant yield method described above. The election is to be made for the taxable year in which you acquired the cash-pay OID note and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. You should consult with your own tax advisors about this election. 265 Table of Contents Market Discount. If you purchase a cash-pay OID note for an amount that is less than its adjusted issue price, the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless that difference is less than a specified de minimis amount. Under the market discount rules, you will be required to treat any principal payment on, or any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of, a cash-pay OID note as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that you have not previously included in income and are treated as having accrued on the note at the time of the payment or disposition. In addition, you may be required to defer, until the maturity of the cash-pay OID note or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction, the deduction of all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness attributable to the note. You may elect, on a note-by-note basis, to deduct the deferred interest expense in a tax year prior to the year of disposition. You should consult your own tax advisors before making this election. Any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the cash-pay OID note, unless you elect to accrue on a constant interest method. You may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues, on either a ratable or constant interest method, in which case the rule described above regarding deferral of interest deductions will not apply. Acquisition Premium, Amortizable Bond Premium. If you purchase a cash-pay OID note for an amount that is greater than its adjusted issue price but equal to or less than its principal amount, you will be considered to have purchased that cash-pay OID note at an acquisition premium. Under the acquisition premium rules, the amount of OID that you must include in gross income with respect to the cash-pay OID note for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of the acquisition premium properly allocable to that year. If you purchase a cash-pay OID note for an amount in excess of its principal amount, you will be considered to have purchased the cash-pay OID note at a premium and you will not be required to include any OID in income. You generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of the cash-pay OID note on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under your regular accounting method. If you do not elect to amortize bond premium, that premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss you would otherwise recognize on disposition of the cash-pay OID note. Sale, Exchange, Retirement, or Other Taxable Disposition of Cash-Pay OID Notes. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition of a cash-pay OID note, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid qualified stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above) and the adjusted tax basis of the cash-pay OID note. Your adjusted tax basis in a cash-pay OID note will, in general, be your cost for that cash-pay OID note, increased by any OID or market discount previously included in income, and reduced by any amortized premium. Except as described above with respect to market discount, any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Toggle Notes Original Issue Discount. The toggle notes are treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as described below. The issuance of PIK Notes generally is not treated as a payment of interest. Instead, the toggle note and any PIK Notes issued in respect of PIK Interest thereon are treated as a single debt instrument under the OID rules. The toggle notes are treated as having been issued with OID in an amount equal to the difference between their stated redemption price at maturity (the sum of all payments to be made on the toggle notes other than qualified stated interest) and their issue price. The issue price of a toggle note is the first price at which a substantial amount of the toggle notes was sold (excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of 266 Table of Contents underwiter, placement agent or wholesaler). The term qualified stated interest means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than debt instruments of the issuer) at least annually at a single fixed rate or, subject to certain conditions, based on one or more interest indices. Because we have the option in any interest payment period after the initial interest payment and prior to November 15, 2011 to make interest payments in PIK Interest instead of paying cash, the stated interest payments on the toggle notes are not qualified stated interest. You generally must include OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income using the constant yield method described in the following paragraphs. The amount of OID that you must include in income each year is the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the toggle note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which you held that toggle note (accrued OID). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The accrual period for a toggle note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the toggle note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the product of the toggle notes adjusted issue price at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period). OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. The yield to maturity of the toggle note is the discount rate that causes the present value of all payments on the note as of its original issue date to equal the issue price of such note. For purposes of determining the yield to maturity, the assumption is that we will pay interest in cash and not exercise the option to pay PIK Interest, except in respect of any period in which we actually elect to pay PIK Interest. The adjusted issue price of a toggle note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period, determined without regard to the amortization of any acquisition or bond premium, as described below, and reduced by any payments previously made on such toggle note. If we in fact pay interest in cash on the toggle notes, you will not be required to adjust your OID inclusions. Each payment made in cash under a toggle note will be treated first as a payment of any accrued OID that has not been allocated to prior payments and second as a payment of principal. You generally will not be required to include separately in income cash payments received on the toggle notes to the extent such payments constitute payments of previously accrued OID or payments of principal. With respect to any interest payment period for which we exercise our option to pay interest in the form of PIK Interest, your OID calculation for future periods will be adjusted by treating the toggle note as if it had been retired and then reissued for an amount equal to its adjusted issue price on the date preceding the first date of such interest payment period, and recalculating the yield to maturity of the reissued note by treating the amount of PIK Interest (and of any prior PIK Interest) as a payment that will be made on the maturity date of such note. The rules regarding OID are complex and the rules described above may not apply in all cases. Accordingly, you should consult your own tax advisors regarding their application. Market Discount. If you purchase a toggle note for an amount that is less than its adjusted issue price, the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless that difference is less than a specified de minimis amount. Under the market discount rules, you will be required to treat any principal payment on, or any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of, a toggle note as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that you have not previously included in income and are treated as having accrued on the note at the time of the payment or disposition. In addition, you may be required to defer, until the maturity of the toggle note or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction, the deduction of all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness attributable 267 Table of Contents to the note. You may elect, on a note-by-note basis, to deduct the deferred interest expense in a tax year prior to the year of disposition. You should consult your own tax advisors before making this election. Any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the toggle note, unless you elect to accrue on a constant interest method. You may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues, on either a ratable or constant interest method, in which case the rule described above regarding deferral of interest deductions will not apply. Acquisition Premium, Amortizable Bond Premium. If you purchase a toggle note for an amount that is greater than its adjusted issue price but equal to or less than the sum of all amounts payable on the toggle note after the purchase date, you will be considered to have purchased that toggle note at an acquisition premium. Under the acquisition premium rules, the amount of OID that you must include in gross income with respect to the toggle note for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of the acquisition premium properly allocable to that year. If you purchase a toggle note for an amount in excess of the sum of all amounts payable on the toggle note after the purchase date, you will be considered to have purchased the toggle note at a premium and you will not be required to include any OID in income. You generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of the toggle note on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under your regular accounting method. If you do not elect to amortize bond premium, that premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss you would otherwise recognize on disposition of the toggle note. Sale, Exchange, Retirement, or Other Taxable Disposition of Toggle Notes. Subject to the discussion below regarding the Mandatory Principal Redemption, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition of a toggle note (or a PIK Note), you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition and the adjusted tax basis of the toggle note (or the PIK Note). Your adjusted tax basis in a toggle note will, in general, be your cost for the toggle note, increased by OID or market discount previously included in income, and reduced by any amortized premium and any cash payments on the toggle note. Although not free from doubt, your adjusted tax basis in the toggle note should be allocated between the original toggle note and any PIK Notes received in respect of PIK Interest thereon in proportion to their relative principal amounts. Your holding period in any PIK Note received in respect of PIK Interest would likely be identical to your holding period for the original toggle note with respect to which the PIK Note was received. Except as described above with respect to market discount, any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Payments received by a U.S. holder upon the Mandatory Principal Redemption of a portion of a toggle note will be treated as tax-free payments of a portion of the then accrued OID with respect to such toggle note in its entirety (including the portion of the toggle note not redeemed). Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences that will apply to non-U.S. holders of the notes. U.S. Federal Withholding Tax The 30% U.S. federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest (which for purposes of this discussion includes OID) on the notes under the portfolio interest rule, provided that:  interest paid on the notes (including OID) is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States;  you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States Treasury regulations; 268 Table of Contents  you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us actually or constructively through stock ownership;  you are not a bank whose receipt of interest (including OID) on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and  either (a) you provide your name and address on an IRS Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form), and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or (b) you hold your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals. If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (including OID) made to you will be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly executed:  IRS Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form) certifying an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or  IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest (including OID) paid on the notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (as discussed below under  U.S. Federal Income Tax). The 30% U.S. federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain that you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition of a note; provided, however, that payments received by a non-U.S. holder upon the Mandatory Principal Redemption of a portion of a toggle note will be treated as payments of a portion of the then accrued OID with respect to such toggle note in its entirety (including the portion of the toggle note not redeemed) and therefore possibly subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax. U.S. Federal Income Tax If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest (including OID) on the notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment), then you will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest (including OID) on a net income in generally the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of such interest (including OID), subject to adjustments. If interest received with respect to the notes is effectively connected income (whether or not a treaty applies), the 30% withholding tax described above will not apply, provided the certification requirements discussed above in  U.S. Federal Withholding Tax are satisfied. Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, any gain realized on the disposition of a note generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:  the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment); or  you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other conditions are met. U.S. Federal Estate Tax Your estate will not be subject to U.S. federal estate tax on notes beneficially owned by you at the time of your death, provided that any payment to you on the notes would be eligible for exemption from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax under the portfolio interest rule described above under  U.S. Federal Withholding Tax without regard to the statement requirement described in the fifth bullet point of that section. 269 Table of Contents Information Reporting and Backup Withholding U.S. Holders In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments of principal and interest (including OID) paid on the notes and to the proceeds of sale or other disposition (including retirement or a redemption) of a note paid to you (unless you are an exempt recipient such as a corporation). Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number or a certification that you are not subject to backup withholding or if you fail to report in full dividend and interest income. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders In general, we must report to the IRS and to you the amount of interest (including OID) paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest (including OID) on the notes that we make to you provided that we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code and we have received from you the required certification that you are a non-U.S. holder described above in the fifth bullet point under  Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders  U.S. Federal Withholding Tax. Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds of a sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of notes within the United States or conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the payor under penalties of perjury that you are a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 270 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION This prospectus is to be used by Banc of America Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and their affiliates in connection with offers and sales of the notes in market-making transactions effected from time to time.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Set forth below are summaries of the statutes, charter provisions, by-laws, contracts or other arrangements under which the directors and officers of the Company and the additional registrant guarantors may be indemnified against liability which they may incur in their capacity as such. In the summaries that follow, defined terms used in each respective subsection apply only to that subsection. California Registrants (a) Columbia ASC Management, L.P. and Riverside Healthcare System, L.P. are registered under the laws of California. The partnership agreements of Columbia ASC Management, L.P. and Riverside Healthcare System, L.P. provide that the limited partner shall indemnify and hold harmless the general partner; its partners, managers, employees, agents and representatives; and the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of its partners to the fullest extent permitted by the California Limited Partnership Act and the California Revised Partnership Act. Neither of these acts, however, addresses indemnification. Section 15904.06 (Operative January 1, 2008) of the 2008 California Revised Limited Partnership Act addresses the rights of a general partner with respect to its management and conduct of partnership activities. The 2008 California Revised Limited Partnership Act provides that a limited partnership shall reimburse a general partner for payments made, and indemnify a general partner for liabilities incurred by, the general partner in the ordinary course of the activities of the partnership or for the preservation of its activities or property. (b) Columbia Riverside, Inc., Encino Hospital Corporation, Inc., Los Robles Regional Medical Center and MCA Investment Company are incorporated under the laws of California. Section 317 of the California General Corporation Law sets forth the provisions pertaining to the indemnification of corporate agents. For purposes of this law, an agent is any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of a corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation in such capacity with respect to any other corporation, partnership, join venture, trust or other enterprise. Indemnification for expenses, including amounts paid on settling or otherwise disposing of a threatened or pending action or defending against the same, can be made in certain circumstances by action of the company through:  a majority vote of a quorum of the corporations Board of Directors consisting of directors who are not party to the proceedings; II-1 Table of Contents  approval of the shareholders, with the shares owned by the person to be indemnified not being entitled to vote thereon; or  such court in which the proceeding is or was pending upon application by designated parties. Under certain circumstances, an agent can be indemnified, even when found liable. Indemnification is mandatory where the agents defense is successful on the merits. The law allows a corporation to make advances of expenses for certain actions upon the receipt of an undertaking that the agent will reimburse the corporation if the agent is found liable. The indemnification provided by Section 317 for acts while serving as a director or officer of the corporation, but not involving breach of duty to the corporation and its shareholders, shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw to the extent authorized by the corporations articles of the corporation. The bylaws of each of the California Registrants in this section (b) provide, in relevant part, that each of the Registrants will indemnify its respective officers and directors, under the circumstances and to the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines and settlements such officers and directors may be required to pay in any action, suit or proceeding which they are or may be made a party by reason of their position as a director, officer or other agent of such Registrant, and otherwise to the full extent permitted under California law and our bylaws for any taken on behalf of the corporation that does not involve gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In addition, Section 14-2-202(b)(4) applies only to claims against a director arising out of his or her role as a director and does not relieve a director from liability arising from his or her role as an officer or in any other capacity.

II-45 Table of Contents Item 17. Undertakings. (a) Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes: (1) to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; (3) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering; (4) that, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use; and (5) that, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrants under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrants undertake that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrants pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrants will be sellers to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrants relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants or used or referred to by the undersigned registrants II-46 Table of Contents (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrants or their securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrants to the purchaser. (b) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrants pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrants have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrants of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrants in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrants will, unless in the opinion of their counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by them is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
