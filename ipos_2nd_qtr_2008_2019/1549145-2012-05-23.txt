THE COMPANY Business Overview From inception (March 28, 2012), Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc.

As of the date of this prospectus, the Company has yet to engage in any meaningful business activities and is an early development stage company. The Companys goal is to create motion pictures and to fully exploit the Films and the Ancillary Rights through several avenues, including theatrical release, cable television, home viewing versions (DVD, VHS) and the Internet. The Company intends to achieve growth through both acquisition and internally generated business. The Company intends to promote the Films utilizing industry marketing efforts such as advance publicity and utilizing recent technological advances through the Internet as well as a target-specific marketing campaigns. The Company intends to establish a website and to explore possibilities including publicizing the Company on, and allowing audiences to download trailers, highlights, clips, script excerpts and/or artwork from such website.

There were no written agreements with any of these consultants. The Business Film Production and Marketing. The Company intended to engage in the business of Film Production and Marketing. The following sets forth a general overview of the various stages of film production, distribution channels and marketing of productions either developed or acquired by the Company. This description is not intended to be exhaustive and is illustrative only as to such stages, channels and processes generally undertaken in the motion picture industry in relation to independent productions such as the films the Company intends to develop. MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW A film project goes through six (6) stages before it is ready for a ticket purchase at the neighborhood theater. Combined, these stages can take approximately from one and a half to three years or more to complete. The stages are: 1) development 4) post-production 2) pre-production 5) distribution 3) principal photography 6) exhibition Development. The first stage in the life of a theatrical motion picture is development. During this period, the executive producer and/or production company create or acquire the theatrical motion picture rights to a property. The company then finances the cost of the screenplay creation and revision to the point where it is determined whether the project has sufficient merit to pursue. If the decision is made to proceed with the film, the creation of a comprehensive budget and shooting schedule is commissioned. With a dollar figure established, the production entity then takes those steps necessary to acquire or have committed adequate funding to finance the production of the film. A distribution commitment may be sought during development, although many independent films are developed and even produced before such a commitment is finalized. Since packaging is often the key to success, some pay or play commitments [a financial commitment to an actor that guarentees the actor their fee even if the film does not get made] with major actors may be put in place during development. Pre-Production. Once the financing has been arranged or committed, the film is ready for pre-production. During this phase, a completion bond is secured, a director is retained, locations and production facilities are secured, casting is completed, and the shooting schedule is planned. Script polishing is also completed during this phase. The pre-production phase of a film usually takes approximately two to four months. Principal Photography. The actual shooting of the film can commence with the completion of pre-production. Principal photography generally lasts from approximately six to fourteen weeks, and could be a longer period for larger budget productions. 2 Post-Production. Before completion of principal photography, post-production ensues, normally encompassing approximately three to six months. Post-Production includes editing, scoring, voice-over dialogue and other elements which are added following the completion of Principal Photography. During this phase, the director and producer make the agreed cuts, rearrangements or other changes in the raw film footage, and the necessary dialogue, music, sound effects, optical effects, and special effects are added. The result of this effort is the completed negative from which release prints are made for release by distributors to theaters. Distribution. In todays entertainment marketplace, the neighborhood movie theater is only the first link in a feature films distribution chain. Many productions are never theatrically released and go directly to other forms of distribution. Regardless of the exposure on initial release, films generally continue generating revenues for many years as they move through additional distribution channels. The Company does not sell its films. It rents or licenses them for specific uses and time periods, while retaining ownership of the underlying rights. In certain instances, the Company may license the distribution rights for specified markets. A typical distribution sequence is described below. Actual release patterns for films are individually tailored, and a film can be in more than one market at a time. MOTION PICTURE MARKETING PLAN The Company intends to rely on a variety of marketing tools, including those which are generally available for independent film exploitation and tools directly developed by the Company. The Company intends to maintain oversight with respect to the advertising and promotion of its productions. The Companys management, advisers and outside consultants have experience in the target-specific marketing and brand identification of theatrical motion pictures. The Company intends to utilize target-specific marketing plans similar to those previously created and implemented by certain of its management with respect to other productions. The Company intends to contract with various consultants and advisors to provide faith-based or church promotions similar to the efforts of certain of the Companys management who worked on the production The Passion of The Christ. The Company intends to market and promote many of its production to faith-based markets and churches. The Companys target-specific marketing plan (both domestically and internationally) may include pre-screenings to large organizations; an advance ticket program through local churches and other Faith based organizations.

You should consider carefully these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report before you decide to purchase our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to continue as a going concern and our ability to obtain future financing. In their report dated May 17, 2012, our independent auditors stated that our financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2012 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue as we have just commenced operations as a development stage company. In our early stages of operations, we expect to experience net losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, increasing sales or obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions where possible. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, you may lose your entire investment. We were formed in March 2012 and have a limited operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives. We are a development stage company with no operating results to date. Since we do not have an established operating history or regular sales yet, you will have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives. The absence of any significant operating history for us makes forecasting our revenue and expenses difficult, and we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls or unexpected expenses. As a result of the absence of any operating history for us, it is difficult to accurately forecast our future revenue. In addition, we have limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses. Current and future expense levels are based on our operating plans and estimates of future revenue. Revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on our ability to promote and sell our services. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which would result in further substantial losses. We may also be unable to expand our operations in a timely manner to adequately meet demand to the extent it exceeds expectations. Our limited operating history does not afford investors a sufficient history on which to base an investment decision. We are currently in the early stages of developing our business. There can be no assurance that at this time that we will operate profitably or that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due. Investors must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies, particularly in rapidly evolving markets. Such risks include the following: · Competition · ability to anticipate and adapt to a competitive market; · ability to effectively manage expanding operations; amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and 4 · dependence upon key personnel to market and sell our services and the loss of one of our key managers may adversely affect the marketing of our services. We cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks. In the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not have the resources to continue or expand our business operations. We have no profitable operating history and May Never Achieve Profitability From inception (March 28, 2012), Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. was organized as a vehicle to engage in the commercial production, distribution and exploitation of Motion Pictures and other Entertainment products including but not limited to animation, television, live events, commercial retail and destination propertys as well as other entertainment related enterprises such as theme parks and theme restaurants and destinations. As of the date of this prospectus, the Company has yet to engage in any meaningful business activities and is an early development stage company. Through April 30, 2012, the Company has not generated any revenues and the principals of the Company have worked without salary and the Company has operated with minimal overhead. We are an early stage company and have a limited history of operations. We are faced with all of the risks associated with a company in the early stages of development. Our business is subject to numerous risks associated with a relatively new, low-capitalized company engaged in our business sector. Such risks include, but are not limited to, competition from well-established and well-capitalized companies, and unanticipated difficulties regarding the marketing and sale of our services. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant commercial sales or achieve profitability. Should this be the case, our common stock could become worthless and investors in our common stock or other securities could lose their entire investment. Dependence on our Management, without whose services Company business operations could cease. At this time, our management is wholly responsible for the development and execution of our business plan. Our management is under no contractual obligation to remain employed by us, although they have no present intent to leave. If our management should choose to leave us for any reason before we have hired additional personnel our operations may fail. Even if we are able to find additional personnel, it is uncertain whether we could find qualified management who could develop our business along the lines described herein or would be willing to work for compensation the Company could afford. Without such management, the Company could be forced to cease operations and investors in our common stock or other securities could lose their entire investment. Our officers and directors devote limited time to the Companys business and are engaged in other business activities At this time, none of our officers and directors devotes his full-time attention to the Companys business. Based upon the growth of the business, we would intend to employ additional management and staff. The limited time devoted to the Companys business could adversely affect the Companys business operations and prospects for the future. Without full-time devoted management, the Company could be forced to cease operations and investors in our common stock or other securities could lose their entire investment. Concentrated control risks; shareholders could be unable to control or influence key corporate actions or effect changes in the Companys board of directors or management. Our current officers and directors currently own 15,000,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 78.89% of the voting control of the Company. Our current officers and directors therefore have the power to make all major decisions regarding our affairs, including decisions regarding whether or not to issue stock and for what consideration, whether or not to sell all or substantially all of our assets and for what consideration and whether or not to authorize more stock for issuance or otherwise amend our charter or bylaws. 5 Lack of additional working capital may cause curtailment of any expansion plans while raising of capital through sale of equity securities would dilute existing shareholders percentage of ownership Our available capital resources will not be adequate to fund our working capital requirements for the 8-month period subsequent to April 30, 2012. A shortage of capital would affect our ability to fund our working capital requirements. If we require additional capital, funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could dilute existing shareholders. If funds are not available, we could be placed in the position of having to cease all operations. We do not presently have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution. This absence may adversely affect our operations We do not presently have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution. The absence of a traditional credit facility with a financial institution could adversely impact our operations. If adequate funds are not otherwise available, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate portions of our operations and product development efforts. Without such credit facilities, the Company could be forced to cease operations and investors in our common stock or other securities could lose their entire investment. Our inability to successfully achieve a critical mass of revenues could adversely affect our financial condition No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully achieve a critical mass of revenue in order to cover our operating expenses and achieve sustainable profitability. Without such critical mass of revenues, the Company could be forced to cease operations. Our success is substantially dependent on general economic conditions and business trends in the entertainment industry, a downturn of which could adversely affect our operations The success of our operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to consumer spending. These factors include economic conditions, activity in the financial markets, general business conditions, personnel cost, inflation, interest rates and taxation. Our business is affected by the general condition and economic stability of our consumers and their continued willingness to expend funds on our productions. An overall decline in the demand for entertainment media could cause a reduction in our sales and the Company could face a situation where it never achieves a critical mass of revenues and thereby be forced to cease operations. Changes in generally accepted accounting principles could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations We are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance. Based on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance, principles or concepts issued by, among other authorities, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, our management believes that our current contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported. However, there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the industries in which we operate. Future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue recognition and/or other accounting policies and practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations. We will need to increase the size of our organization, and may experience difficulties in managing growth. We are a small company with no current full-time employees. We expect to experience a period of significant expansion in headcount, facilities, infrastructure and overhead and anticipate that further expansion will be 6 required to address potential growth and market opportunities. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate managers. Our future financial performance and its ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to manage any future growth effectively. We are subject to compliance with securities law, which exposes us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights. We have offered and sold our common stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as those of various state securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual; that is, the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering. We have not received a legal opinion to the effect that any of our prior offerings were exempt from registration under any federal or state law. Instead, we have relied upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemptions, including information provided by investors themselves. If any prior offering did not qualify for such exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired. It is possible that if an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were successful in seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally, if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies. We incur costs associated with SEC reporting compliance. The Company made the decision to become an SEC reporting company in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We incur certain costs of compliance with applicable SEC reporting rules and regulations including, but not limited to attorneys fees, accounting and auditing fees, other professional fees, financial printing costs and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs in an amount estimated at approximately $25,000 per year. On balance, the Company determined that the incurrence of such costs and expenses was preferable to the Company being in a position where it had very limited access to additional capital funding. The availability of a large number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock may, upon their issuance, lead to dilution of existing stockholders. We are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of which, as of May 21, 2012, 19,395,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Additional shares may be issued by our board of directors without further stockholder approval. The issuance of large numbers of shares, possibly at below market prices, is likely to result in substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders. In addition, issuances of large numbers of shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our need for additional capital that could dilute the ownership interest of investors. We require substantial working capital to fund our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or convertible debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of holders of our common stock and they may experience additional dilution. We cannot predict whether additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Since our inception, we have experienced negative cash flow from operations and expect to experience significant negative cash flow from operations in the future. The issuance of additional common stock by the Company may have the effect of further diluting the proportionate equity interest and voting power of holders of our common stock. 7 We may not have adequate internal accounting controls. While we have certain internal procedures in our budgeting, forecasting and in the management and allocation of funds, our internal controls may not be adequate. We are constantly striving to improve our internal accounting controls. Our board of directors has not designated an Audit Committee and we do not have any outside directors. We do not have a dedicated full time Chief Financial Officer. We hope to develop an adequate internal accounting control to budget, forecast, manage and allocate our funds and account for them. There is no guarantee that such improvements will be adequate or successful or that such improvements will be carried out on a timely basis. If we do not have adequate internal accounting controls, we may not be able to appropriately budget, forecast and manage our funds, we may also be unable to prepare accurate accounts on a timely basis to meet our continuing financial reporting obligations and we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under US securities laws. We do not have inadequate insurance coverage We do not have any insurance coverage of any description at this time and therefore have the risk of loss or damages to our business and assets. We cannot assure you that we would not face liability upon the occurrence of any event which could result in any loss or damages being assessed against the Company. Moreover, any insurance we may ultimately acquire may not be adequate to cover any loss or liability we may incur. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the financial markets. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may result in substantial penalties and harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Our operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future We currently intend to retain all future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. There is currently no market for our securities and there can be no assurance that any market will ever develop or that our common stock will be listed for trading. There has not been any established trading market for our common stock and there is currently no market for our securities. Even if we are ultimately approved for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB), there can be no assurance as the prices at which our common stock will trade if a trading market develops, of which there can be no assurance. Until our common stock is fully distributed and an orderly market develops, (if ever) in our common stock, the price at which it trades is likely to fluctuate significantly. Prices for our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock, developments affecting our business, including the impact of the factors referred to elsewhere in these Risk Factors, investor perception of us and general economic and market conditions. No assurances can be given that an orderly or liquid market will ever develop for the shares of our common stock. Due to the anticipated low price of the securities, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. 8 Our common stock is subject to the Penny Stock Regulations Our common stock will likely be subject to the SEC's penny stock rules to the extent that the price remains less than $5.00. Those rules, which require delivery of a schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks before any sale, may further limit your ability to sell your shares. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our common stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition of penny stock and subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000, or annual incomes exceeding $200,000 or $300,000, together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser's prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer's presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, the `penny stock` rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their common stock in the secondary market. Our common stock is illiquid and subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities. We have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. Recent Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors' independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. 9 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY If we fail to obtain financing for the production of a motion picture, our business may fail. We do not have sufficient capital to meet our operating requirements for the next 8 months, much less the funds to support the funding of the production of any motion pictures. We intend to make motion pictures with production budgets of $3-10 million or more. We will need to raise all the money required to fund the production of motion pictures from outside financing. Such financing could take the form of co-production or joint venture arrangements or partnerships, additional sales of our securities or an operating line of credit. Regardless of the amount of money we raise, additional financing will be needed to produce additional motion pictures. No assurance can be given that financing will be available to us, at all, or on favorable terms. Unless such additional financing is available to us, our production activities may be materially adversely affected and you may lose your entire investment. We have no financing commitments at this time. If we are unable to produce commercially successful films, our business may fail. Producing films involves substantial risks, because it requires that we spend significant funds based entirely on our preliminary evaluation of the screenplay's commercial potential as a film. It is impossible to predict the success of any film before the production starts. The ability of a motion picture to generate revenues will depend upon a variety of unpredictable factors, including: * public taste, which is always subject to change; * the quantity and popularity of other films and leisure activities available to the public at the time of our release; * the competition for exhibition at movie theatres, through video retailers, on cable television and through other forms of distribution; and * the fact that not all films are distributed in all media. For any of these reasons, the films that we produce may be commercially unsuccessful and our business may fail. If we are unable to secure distribution of our films, our business will suffer. Because we may initially lack the resources to distribute our films ourselves, we plan to enter into distribution agreements with established distribution companies. As a result, we may be unable to secure distribution agreements or revenue guarantees before funds are spent on production. In addition, if we are unable to obtain theatrical distribution on acceptable terms, we may evaluate other alternatives such as retaining a distributor as an independent contractor or bypassing theatrical distribution altogether. If we retain a distributor as an independent contractor we may need to seek additional financing to cover this cost, which we anticipate will be $50,000 to $100,000 per film. If we bypass theatrical distribution and attempt to release our films directly to pay cable or home video, we may not generate enough revenues to become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate distribution, we may not have the ability to generate sufficient revenues to fund our production costs and operating expenses. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected. We seek to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements, trademarks, domain names and other measures, some of which afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain and use property that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that 10 our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to steal our intellectual property. Our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. An assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses and our business might be harmed. We might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays, or require us to enter into licensing agreements. 11 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements. This prospectus includes statements regarding our plans, goals, strategies, intent, beliefs or current expectations. These statements are expressed in good faith and based upon a reasonable basis when made, but there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved or accomplished. These forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terms and phrases such as believe, plan, intend, anticipate, target, estimate, expect, and the like, and/or future-tense or conditional constructions may, could, should, etc. Items contemplating or making assumptions about, actual or potential future sales, market size, collaborations, and business opportunities also constitute such forward-looking statements. Although forward-looking statements in this report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report, other than as may be required by applicable law or regulation. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected or projected. USE OF PROCEEDS This prospectus relates to the resale of our common stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by the selling stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock in this offering. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE Since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of the shares of common stock was arbitrarily determined. The offering price of the shares of our common stock has been determined arbitrarily by us and does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) concurrently with or shortly after the filing of this prospectus. In order to be quoted on the Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. In addition, there is no assurance that our common stock will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the common stock in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity. DILUTION The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued or will be issued to our shareholders upon conversion or exercise of certain Convertible Securities. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. 12 MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Holders As of May 21, 2012, there were 50 record holders of our common stock and there were 19,395,000 shares of our common stock outstanding. No public market currently exists for shares of our common stock. We intend to apply to have our common stock listed for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. The Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 The Securities and Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). A purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock. The shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need to comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, which: · contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; · contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended; · contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including "bid" and "ask" prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; · contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; · defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and · contains such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format) as the Securities and Exchange Commission shall require by rule or regulation; The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, to the customer: · the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; · the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; · the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and · monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. 13 In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities. Equity Compensation Plan Information We have no outstanding stock options or other equity compensation plans. Reports We are subject to certain reporting requirements and will furnish annual financial reports to our stockholders, certified by our independent accountants, and will furnish unaudited quarterly financial reports in our quarterly reports filed electronically with the SEC. All reports and information filed by us can be found at the SEC website, www.sec.gov. Stock Transfer Agent The stock transfer agent for our securities is Island Stock Transfer. Dividend Policy We have not previously declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors. We intend to retain any earnings for use in our operations and the expansion of our business. Payment of dividends in the future will depend on our future earnings, future capital needs and our operating and financial condition, among other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We are not under any contractual restriction as to our present or future ability to pay dividends. Equity Compensation Plan Information We have no outstanding stock options or other equity compensation plans.

At April 30, 2012 we had approximately $10,000 in cash and approximately $0 other assets and, while we had not yet incurred any liabilities as of April 30, 2012, the Company expects to incur significant liabilities in connection with its start-up activities, including the cost associated with securities law compliance, which are estimated to exceed $50,000 at a minimum. As a result, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2012 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern based upon recurring operating losses and our need to obtain additional financing to sustain operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from our operations to pay our operating expenses. There are no assurances that we will continue as a going concern.

We will incur significant additional expenses in connection with our start-up which have yet to be recognized which are estimated to exceed an additional $50,000. These expenses will principally comprise professional and legal fees and other costs related to the start-up and organization of our business and raising initial capital for the Company. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of April 30, 2012, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $10,000 and had no current or long term liabilities.

Beneficial ownership information for the selling stockholders is provided as of May 21, 2012, based upon information provided by the selling stockholders or otherwise known to us. 22 (2) (3) Assumes the sale of all shares of common stock registered pursuant to this prospectus. The selling stockholders are under no obligation known to us to sell any shares of common stock at this time. Shares held by Business Law Professionals PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The selling stockholders may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. If the shares of common stock are sold through underwriters or broker-dealers, the selling stockholders will be responsible for underwriting discounts or commission or agents commissions. The selling stockholders have advised us that they will sell the shares of common stock from time to time in the open market, at the initial offering price of $1.00 per share, which was the price they paid for their shares, until the shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or national securities exchange, at which point the selling securities holders may sell the registered shares at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or negotiated prices. The selling stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:  any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale;  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  transactions otherwise than on these exchanges or systems or in the over-the-counter market;  through the writing of options, whether such options are listed on an options exchange or otherwise;  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  short sales;  broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;  a combination of any such methods of sale; and  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. 23 The selling stockholders may also engage in short sales against the box, puts and calls and other transactions in our securities or derivatives of our securities and may sell or deliver shares in connection with these trades. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. The selling stockholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. Any profits on the resale of shares of common stock by a broker-dealer acting as principal might be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the Securities Act. Discounts, concessions, commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, attributable to the sale of shares will be borne by a selling stockholder. The selling stockholders may agree to indemnify any agent, dealer or broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving sales of the shares if liabilities are imposed on that person under the Securities Act. In connection with the sale of the shares of common stock or otherwise, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the shares of common stock in the course of hedging in positions they assume. The selling stockholders may also sell shares of common stock short and deliver shares of common stock covered by this prospectus to close out short positions and to return borrowed shares in connection with such short sales. The selling stockholders may also loan or pledge shares of common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such shares. The selling stockholders may, from time to time, pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of common stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of common stock from time to time under this prospectus after we have filed an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. The selling stockholders also may transfer the shares of common stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus and may sell the shares of common stock from time to time under this prospectus after we have filed an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. The selling stockholders also may transfer and donate the shares of common stock in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. The selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions paid, or any discounts or concessions allowed to, such broker-dealers or agents and any profit realized on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. At the time a particular offering of the shares of common stock is made, a prospectus supplement, if required, will be distributed which will set forth the aggregate amount of shares of common stock being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any broker-dealers or agents, any discounts, commissions and other terms constituting compensation from the selling stockholders and any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to broker-dealers. Under the securities laws of some states, the shares of common stock may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the shares of common stock may not be sold unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with. There can be no assurance that any selling stockholder will sell any or all of the shares of common stock registered pursuant to the shelf registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. Each selling stockholder has informed us that it does not have any agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. None of the selling stockholders who are affiliates of broker-dealers, other than the initial purchasers in private transactions, purchased the shares of common stock outside of the ordinary course of business or, at the time of the purchase of the common stock, had any agreements, plans or understandings, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. 24 We are paying all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the shares of common stock. Except as provided for indemnification of the selling stockholders, we are not obligated to pay any of the expenses of any attorney or other advisor engaged by a selling stockholder. We have not agreed to indemnify any selling stockholders against losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. If we are notified by any selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of shares of common stock, if required, we will file a supplement to this prospectus. If the selling stockholders use this prospectus for any sale of the shares of common stock, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. The anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of our common stock and activities of the selling stockholders, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares of common stock by the selling stockholders and any other participating person. Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the shares of common stock to engage in passive market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock. Passive market making involves transactions in which a market maker acts as both our underwriter and as a purchaser of our common stock in the secondary market. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares of common stock and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock. Once sold under the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, the shares of common stock will be freely tradable in the hands of persons other than our affiliates. EXPERTS Our financial statements for the period from inception (March 28, 2012) through April 30, 2012 along with the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows in this prospectus have been audited by Paritz & Co P.A., of Hackensack, New Jersey, independent registered public accounting firm, to the extent and for the periods set forth in their report, and are set forth in this prospectus in reliance upon such report given upon the authority of them as experts in auditing and accounting.

Further information on the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC under the Securities Act for the common stock offered by this prospectus.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our consolidated financial statements of commencing on page F-1 are included with this prospectus. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in US dollars. a) The period from inception (March 28, 201) to April 30, 2012 (audited) 25 ALLIANCE MEDIA GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. (a development stage company) as of April 30, 2012 and the related statements of operations, stockholder's deficiency and cash flows for the period from inception (March 28, 2012) to April 30, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as, evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of (a development stage company) as of April 30, 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from inception (March 28, 2012) to April 30, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has yet to commence any operations and expects to incur significant costs in connection with its start-up activities and the Company may be unable to raise further equity. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Paritz & Co Paritz & Co., P.A.

F-5 ALLIANCE MEDIA GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. A Development Stage Company NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APRIL 30, 2012 NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: (a) Organization and Business: Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 28, 2012 for the purpose of engaging in the commercial production, distribution and exploitation of motion pictures and other entertainment products including but not limited to animation, television, live events, commercial retail and destination propertys as well as other entertainment related enterprises such as theme parks and theme restaurants and destinations. The Company is currently in the development stage. All activities of the Company to date relate to its organization, initial funding, share issuances and regulatory compliance. (b) Basis of Presentation The financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded as earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. The Company has adopted a December 31 year-end. (c) Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern, which assumes the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has engaged in only development stage activities since inception (March 28, 2012) through April 30, 2012. At April 30, 2012 the Company had approximately $10,000 in cash and approximately $0 other assets and, while the Company had not yet incurred any liabilities as of April 30, 2012, the Company expects to incur significant additional liabilities in connection with its start-up activities, including the cost associated with securities law compliance, which are estimated to exceed $50,000 at a minimum. As a result, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2012 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern based upon recurring operating losses and our need to obtain additional financing to sustain operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from our operations to pay our operating expenses. There are no assurances that we will continue as a going concern. (d) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (e) Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at April 30, 2012. (f) Income Taxes: The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect, when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized, when it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized. F-6 ALLIANCE MEDIA GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. A Development Stage Company NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APRIL 30, 2012 NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT): (g) Profit (Loss) per Common Share: Basic profit (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted loss per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the treasury stock or modified treasury stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period. The Company does not have any potentially dilutive instruments for this reporting period. (h) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. NOTE 2 – CAPITAL STOCK: The total number of shares of capital stock which the Company has authority to issue is one hundred million (100,000,000), all comprising shares designated as common stock at $.001 par value (the Common Stock). As of April 30, 2012, the Company had 19,265,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. Holders of shares of Common stock shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share held at all stockholders meetings for all purposes, including the election of directors. The Common Stock does not have cumulative voting rights. No holder of shares of stock of any class shall be entitled as a matter of right to subscribe for or purchase or receive any part of any new or additional issue of shares of stock of any class, or of securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, whether now hereafter authorized or whether issued for money, for consideration other than money, or by way of dividend. On April 2, 2012, the Registrant sold an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock to its founders, Daniel de Liege (5,000,000 shares), Mark W. Koch (5,000,000 shares) and Johan Sturm (5,000,000 shares) for an aggregate investment of $15,000. Payment for these shares was booked as a stock subscription receivable. The Registrant sold these shares of Common Stock under an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. On April 9, 2012, the Registrant sold an aggregate of 400,000 shares of Company Common Stock to four of the Companys newly appointed directors for an aggregate investment of $4,000.00. Payment for these shares was booked as a stock subscription receivable. The Registrant sold these shares of Common Stock under an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Also on April 9, 2012, the Registrant sold an aggregate of 865,000 shares of Company Common stock to ten (10) consultants who had provided services in connection with the conceptualization of the Company and the development of the Companys Business Plan.

NOTE 3 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Companys accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows when implemented. NOTE 4 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On May 4, 2012, the Company sold an aggregate of 130,000 shares of Company Common stock to two (2) consultants who had provided services in connection with the conceptualization of the Company and the development of the Companys Business Plan.

Disclosure controls and procedure include, without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Companys sole officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: ● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and ● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal 27 control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. As of April 30, 2012, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2012. Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. Managements Remediation Initiatives Given the financial resources available to the Company, the Company is not in a position to institute any realistic remediation of the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls. As such time as the Company commences operations and has the financial resources to address and eliminate the identified weaknesses, we intend to create take action to do so. Unfortunately, until the Company has such financial resources, the identified weaknesses will continue to exist. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . During the period from inception (March 28, 2012) through April 30, 2012, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls . A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. PART II INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS Item 10. Indemnification of Directors and Officers Pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. In certain cases, we may advance expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in any such proceeding 28 as to which such person is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The prior discussion of indemnification in this paragraph is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. Indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to directors or officers pursuant to the foregoing provisions. However, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. Item 11. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution Although we will receive no proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to this prospectus, we have agreed to bear the costs and expenses of the registration of the shares. Our expenses in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities being registered are estimated as follows: Nature of expense Amount SEC Registration fee $ 677 Accounting fees and expenses $ 2,500 Legal fees and expenses $ 5,000 Printing expenses $ 1,000 Miscellaneous $ 823 TOTAL $ 10,000 All amounts are estimates other than the Securities and Exchange Commissions registration fee. We are paying all expenses of the offering listed above. No portion of these expenses will be borne by the selling shareholders. The selling shareholders, however, will pay any other expenses incurred in selling their common stock, including any brokerage commissions or costs of sale. Item 12.

Undertakings The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: i. To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; ii. To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement. iii. To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (5) Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (6) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: 31 i. Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; ii. Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; iii. The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and iv. Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
