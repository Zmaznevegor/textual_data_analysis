The information in this preliminary prospectus is not complete and may be changed.

This preliminary prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted under applicable law. 2 ___________________________________________________________________________________ PROSPECTUS – SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED JUNE 30, 2015 Capital Holdings Corp. Up to 20,000,000 Common S hares at $0.05 Per Share This is the initial public offering of shares of our common stock. We are offering 20,000,000 shares of our common stock at a pric e of $0.05 per share. Our common stock is not low listed on any national securities exchange or the NASDAQ stock market, an d is not eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board. While we intend to apply for the quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB upon effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, there can be no assurance that we will meet the minimum requirements for such listing or that a market maker will agreed to file on our behalf the necessary documentation with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for such application for quotation to be approved. The offering will commence on the effective date of this prospectus and will terminate on or before _______. We will sell the common shares ourselves and do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions. We will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no one has agreed to buy any of our common shares. There is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of such common shares will go into escrow, trust or another similar arrangement. We will bear the all of the costs associated with this offering. Our current business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire small and medium size technology companies, and develop those acquired companies to increase their value. We intend to concentrate our acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that the Company believes to be undervalued. We will seek opportunities to assist acquired companies with management strength and capital for growth for purposes of selling such companies later or adding them to the Company’s profile of subsidiaries. Our auditors have indicated in their opinion on our financial statements as of and for the period from inception to March 31, 2015 that there exists substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Moreover, we are an early stage venture with limited operating history. As such, this offering is highly speculative and the common stock being offered for sale involves a high degree of risk and should be considered only be persons who can afford the loss of their entire investment. Readers are encouraged to reference the section entitled “Risk Factors” herein for additional information regarding the risks associated with our company and common stock . Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The information in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed. This prospectus is included in the registration statement that was filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We may not sell these securities until the registration statement becomes effective. This prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted. 3 ___________________________________________________________________________________ The date of this prospectus is June 30, 2015 4 ___________________________________________________________________________________ TABLE OF CONTENTS Summary Information 6 The Offering 7 Risk Factors 10 Use of Proceeds 17 Determination of Offering Price 18 Dividend Policy 18 Dilution 18 Plan of Distribution 19 Description of Securities 21 Business Operations 23 Directors, Officers and Control Persons 24 Security Ownership and Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 26 Certain Relations and Related Transactions 26 Interests of Named Experts 27 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Ops. 27 Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters 30 Financial Statements 32 Indemnification of Officers and Directors Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Exhibit Index Undertakings Signatures 5 ___________________________________________________________________________________ A CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan, and the adequacy of our available cash resources. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Actual results may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements. The economic environment within which we operate could materially affect our actual results. Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking statements and/or predictions include, among other things: the volatility of real estate prices, the possibility that our marketing efforts will not be successful in identifying buyers of real estate, , the Company’s need for and ability to obtain additional financing, and, other factors over which we have little or no control. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. SUMMARY INFORMATION As used in this prospectus, references to the “Company,” “we,” “our”, “us” or “Capital Holdings” refer to Capital Holdings Corp. unless the context otherwise indicated. You should carefully read all information in the prospectus, including the financial statements and their explanatory notes, under the Financial Statements prior to making an investment decision. The Company Organization: The registrant was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 6, 2015. Our principal executive offices are located at 1199 S. Federal Hwy, Ste 136, Boca Raton FL 33432. Management: Our Chief Executive Officer is Mr. Nicholas Gaffney. Mr. Gaffney represents our only officer and director. Plan of Operations: Capital Holdings is a development stage technology holding and service company whose mission is to pursue suitable acquisitions for its portfolio by acquiring and developing small and medium size technology companies that the Company believes are undervalued. The Company plans to assist its subsidiaries with management strength and capital for growth to increase the value of its portfolio of subsidiaries. Historical Operations: The Company has limited historical operations. Since its inception on February 6, 2015, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing . 6 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Current Operations: Our Chief Executive Officer is currently focusing his efforts on identifying undervalued small and medium sized technology companies that may be a target for acquisition and obtaining financing. Going Concern: Our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our lack of operating history and the fact to date have had no significant revenues. Potential investors should be aware that there are difficulties associated with being a new venture, and the high rate of failure associated with this fact. We have an accumulated deficit of at and have had no significant revenues to date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The Company has no present plans to be acquired or to merge with another company nor does the registrant, or any of its shareholders, have any plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction. THE OFFERING Type of Securities Offered: Common Stock Common Shares Being Sold In this Offering: Twenty Million (20,000,000) Offering Price: The Company will offer its common shares at $0.05 per share.

Our Director may cancel the offering at any time. Best efforts offering: We are offering our Common Stock on a “best efforts” basis through our Chief Executive Officer, who will not receive any discounts or commissions for selling the shares. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold in order to close this offering. Use of proceeds: We will use the proceeds of this offering to first cover administrative expenses incurred in connection with this offering and then for the general working capital requirements of the Company. Market for our Common Stock: There is presently no public market for our common shares. We anticipate applying for quoting of our common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which operates the OTCBB and OTCQB, nor can there be any assurance that such application for quotation will be approved. 7 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Common Stock Control: Mr. Nicholas Gaffney, our Chief Executive Officer and only director, currently owns a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the company, and will continue to own sufficient common shares to control the operations of the company after this offering, irrespective of its outcome. Penny Stock Regulation: The liquidity of our common stock is restricted as the registrant’s common stock falls within the definition of a penny stock. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell the registrant's common stock, and may affect the ability to resell the registrant's common stock Emerging Growth Company We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 1. The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more; · 2. The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement; · 3. The date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or · 4. The date on which such issuer is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. These exemptions are also available to us as a Smaller Reporting Company. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Where You Can Find Additional Information We have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-1. For further information about us and the shares of common stock to be sold in the offering, please refer to the registration statement and the exhibits and schedules thereto. The registration statement and exhibits may be inspected, without charge, and copies may be obtained at prescribed rates, at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F St., N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

The registration statement and other information filed with the SEC are also available at the web site maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov 8 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Summary Financial Information Because this is only a financial summary, it does not contain all the financial information that may be important to you. Therefore, you should carefully read all the information in this prospectus, including the financial statements and their explanatory notes before making an investment decision. CAPITAL HOLDINGS CORP STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS For the period February 6, 2015 (Inception) to March 31, 2015 (Audited) $ Revenues 3,606 Operating expenses: - General, office and administrative expenses 14,315 Net Income (Loss) From Operations (10,709) Income / (Loss) before taxes (10,709) Provisions for taxes 0 Net Income / (loss) (10,709) Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share (0.0004) Weighted average number of shares outstanding (30,250,000) “The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.” 9 ___________________________________________________________________________________ RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information provided in this prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any of our common stock. All material risks are discussed in this section. Risks Related to Our Company Our having generated no revenues from operations makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance. From inception February 6, 2015 to March 31, 2015, we have generated no revenues and incurred a loss of ($10,709) As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Because of the related uncertainties, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues and expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable data, we may never become profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price. We may be unable to continue paying the costs of being a reporting public company. The costs of being a public reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may be substantial and the Company may not be able to absorb the costs of being a public company which may cause us to cease being public in the future or require additional fundraising in order to remain in business. We estimate that in the future, costs for legal and accounting at $25,000 per year . Our auditor has indicated in its report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of revenues and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations. Our auditor has indicated in its report that our lack of revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws limit the liability of, and provide indemnification for, our officers and directors. Our Certificate of Incorporation, generally limits our officers’ and directors’ personal liability to the Company and its stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer or director except for breach of the duty of loyalty or acts or omissions not made in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, provide indemnification for our officers and directors to the fullest extent authorized by the Nevada Corporations Code against all expense, liability, and loss, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement reasonably incurred or suffered by an officer or director in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " Proceeding ") to which the officer or director is made a party or is threatened to be made a party, or in which the officer or director is involved by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or director of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company whether the basis of the Proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity as an officer or director, or in any other capacity while serving as an officer or director. Thus, the Company may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions by the officers and directors for liabilities incurred in connection with their good faith acts for the Company. Such an indemnification payment might deplete the Company's assets. Stockholders who have questions regarding the fiduciary obligations of the officers and directors of the Company should consult with independent legal counsel. It is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission that exculpation from and indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder is against public policy and therefore unenforceable. We are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations . We are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations, and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs. Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully sell our equity or debt securities. The Company may not be able to attain profitability without additional funding, which may be unavailable. The Company has limited capital resources. Unless the Company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, the Company may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force the Company to cease operations if additional financing is not available. No known alternative resources of funds are available in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations. 10 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Expenses required to operate as a public company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Operating as a public company is more expensive than operating as a private company, including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned. We may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements. We anticipate that the cost of SEC reporting will be approximately $25,000 annually. Our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. If we fail to meet these requirements, we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board, or, if we have secured a qualification, we may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the OTC Bulletin Board. Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly, annual reports and other required SEC reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming a non-reporting issuer. Our lack of history makes evaluating our business difficult. We have a limited operating history and we may not sustain profitability in the future. To sustain profitability, we must: - Identify viable acquisition opportunities; - Be able to run any acquired acquisitions in a profitable manner; - Obtain the necessary funding to make acquisitions and provide for working capital; and - adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments. We may not be successful in accomplishing these objectives. Further, our lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development, particularly companies in highly competitive industries. The historical information in this report may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance. For example, we expect that our future annual growth rate in revenues will be moderate and likely be less than the growth rates experienced in the early part of our history Risks Related to our Business Scarcity of and competition for acquisition opportunities may limit possible business acquisitions, which may result in the failure of the business. The Company is and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking acquisition of small private entities in the technology sector. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisition of companies that may be desirable target candidates for the Company. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than the Company; consequently, the Company will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing an acquisition. Moreover, we will also compete in seeking acquisition candidates with numerous other small public companies. We may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions. Acquisitions are a significant part of our growth strategy. However, we may be unable to implement this strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates, reach agreement with acquisition targets on acceptable terms or arrange required financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms. Any future acquisitions that we may make could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our business, financial condition or operating results. If we are successful in consummating acquisitions, those acquisitions could subject us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to: · the purchase price we pay and/or unanticipated costs could significantly deplete our cash reserves or result in dilution to our existing stockholders; · we may find that the acquired company or technologies do not improve develop as planned; · key personnel and customers of the acquired company may terminate their relationships with the acquired company as a result of the acquisition; · we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting; · we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not be able to discover during our due diligence or adequately adjust for in our acquisition arrangements; · our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises; · we may incur one-time write-offs or restructuring charges in connection with the acquisition; · we may acquire goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to amortization or impairment tests, which could result in future charges to earnings. We cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate or profitably manage any of our acquired businesses. In addition, we cannot assure you that, following any acquisition, our continued business will achieve profitability, efficiencies or synergies that justify acquisition or that the acquisition will result in increased earnings for us in any future period. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 11 ___________________________________________________________________________________ An acquisition candidate may be in the early stages of development or be financially unstable, which may result in a failed acquisition or in failure of the business after an acquisition. A company that is a target for acquisition may be financially unstable, or may be in its early stages of development or growth without established records of sales or earnings. Thus it is possible that any such acquisition will fail or that our business may be adversely affected after completion of an acquisition, resulting in a loss of the investor’s investment. A lack of diversification may limit future business opportunities and may affect future performance. Our proposed operations, even if successful, will in all likelihood result in the Company engaging in an acquisition with companies in the technology industry. Our inability to diversify acquisitions into a number of areas may subject us to economic fluctuations within the technology industry and therefore increase the risks associated with our operations. We depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key management could harm our business. Our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our founder and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Gaffney. If we lose his services or if he fails to perform in his current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, our business could suffer. Significant turnover in our management could significantly deplete our institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the acquisition and marketing aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future. Our management has not had experience in managing the day to day operations of a public company and, as a result, we may incur additional expenses associated with the management of our company. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Gaffney is responsible for the operations and reporting of our company. The requirements of operating as a small public company are new to our management. This may require us to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned. We may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements. We anticipate that the costs associated with SEC requirements associated with going and staying public are estimated to be approximately $25,000 in connection with this registration statement and thereafter $20,000 annually. If we lack cash resources to cover these costs in the future, our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our potential results of operations, cash flow and financial condition after we commence operations. Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company. As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as a company is deemed to be an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies. These provisions include: a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management's Discussion and Analysis included in an initial public offering registration statement; an exemption to provide less than five years of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement; an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company's internal controls over financial reporting; an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies; an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; and reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company's executive compensation arrangements. An emerging growth company is also exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley which requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Similarly, as a Smaller Reporting Company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until such time as we cease being a Smaller Reporting Company. As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: -the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering, - the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1 billion or more, - the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or - as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. 12 ___________________________________________________________________________________ You may have limited access to information regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the SEC could be automatically suspended under certain circumstances. As of effectiveness of our registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we will be required to file periodic reports with the SEC which will be immediately available to the public for inspection and copying (see “Where You Can Find More Information” elsewhere in this prospectus). Except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective, these reporting obligations may (in our discretion) be automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if we have less than 300 shareholders and do not file a registration statement on Form 8A (which we have no current plans to file). If this occurs after the year in which our registration statement becomes effective, we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC and your access to our business information would then be even more restricted. After this registration statement on Form S-1 becomes effective, we will be required to deliver periodic reports to security holders. However, we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors, officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Previously, a company with more than 500 shareholders of record and $10 million in assets had to register under the Exchange Act. However, the JOBS Act raises the minimum shareholder threshold from 500 to either 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not "accredited investors" (or 2,000 persons in the case of banks and bank holding companies). The JOBS Act excludes securities received by employees pursuant to employee stock incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold. This means that access to information regarding our business and operations will be limited. We do not yet have substantial assets or revenues and are largely dependent upon the proceeds of this offering to fully fund our business. If we do not the sell shares in this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to complete our business or abandon them. We have limited capital resources. To date, the Company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated sufficient cash from operations to be profitable. Unless the company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, we may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may for us to cease operations if additional financing is not available. No known alternative sources of funds are available to the Company in the event it does not have adequate proceeds from this offering. However, the Company believes that the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to satisfy operating requirements for the next twelve months The Company may not be able to attain profitability without additional funding, which may be unavailable. The Company has limited capital resources. Unless the Company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, the Company may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force the Company to cease operations if additional financing is not available. No known alternative resources of funds are available in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations. Risks Related to the Market for our Stock Investors may have difficulty in reselling their shares due to the lack of market or state Blue Sky laws. Our common stock is currently not quoted on any market. No market may ever develop for our common stock, or if developed, may not be sustained in the future. The holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful in having the Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities to be a limited one. We intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a "manual exemption." This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer's balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. We may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a non-issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin. Accordingly, our shares should be considered totally illiquid, which inhibits investors’ ability to resell their shares. 13 ___________________________________________________________________________________ We will be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. We anticipate that our common stock will become a “penny stock”, and we will become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock. We do not anticipate that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest. Sales of our common stock under Rule 144 could reduce the price of our stock. There is an aggregate of 30,750,000 outstanding shares of our common stock that Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 defines as restricted securities. 20,000,000 newly issued shares are being registered in this offering, however all of the remaining shares will still be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144. In general, persons holding restricted securities, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of at least six months, may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period, and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price. The availability for sale of substantial amounts of common stock under Rule 144 could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities. Because we do not have an audit or compensation committee, shareholders will have to rely on the entire board of directors, none of which are independent, to perform these functions. We do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors. Indeed, we do not have any audit or compensation committee. These functions are performed by the board of directors as a whole. No members of the board of directors are independent directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. Our Chief Executive Officer and Director owns a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect certain corporate actions . Our Chief Executive Officer and Director Nicholas Gaffney owns all of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, currently, and after the offering, he will possess a significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions. Their ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer. There may not be funds available for net income because our Chief Executive Officer and Director maintains significant control and can determine her own salary and perquisites. Our Chief Executive Officer and Director Nicholas Gaffney owns all of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, there may not be funds available for net income because he maintains significant control and can determine her own salary and perquisites. We may, in the future, issue additional shares of common stock, which would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value. Our Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of 499,000,000 shares of common stock. The future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. 14 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Due to the lack of a current public market for our stock, investors may have difficulty in selling stock they purchase. Prior to this Offering, no public trading market existed for the Company’s securities. There can be no assurance that a public trading market for the Company’s common stock will develop or that a public trading market, if develop, will be sustained. The common stock sold pursuant to this prospectus will be freely tradable, however will not be eligible for quotation on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. Although the Company intends to become eligible for quotation on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board through having a registered broker dealer submit a Form 15c211 with the National Association of Securities Dealers, there can be no assurance as to when the Company’s common stock will be declared eligible for quotation on the OTCBB. In addition, while the Company’s common stock may be eligible for quotation on the "Pink Sheets", the Company does not intend on pursuing having its common stock listed for quotation on the Pink Sheets. Thus, it is anticipated that there will be little or no market for the Shares until the Company is eligible to have its common stock quoted on the OTCBB and as a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any Shares purchased hereunder. Because there is none and may be no public market for the Company’s stock, the Company may not be able to secure future equity financing which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, when and if the Company’s common stock is eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, there can also be no assurance as to the depth or liquidity of any market for the common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares. As a result, investors could find it more difficult to trade, or to obtain accurate quotations of the market value of, the stock as compared to securities that are traded on the NASDAQ trading market or on an exchange, and an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any Shares purchased hereunder. We have not paid dividends and do not anticipate the payment of dividends. The Company does not currently intend to pay cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying such dividends at any time in the foreseeable future. At present, the Company will follow a policy of retaining all of its earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of its business. Because no dividends will be paid, purchasers of shares should not expect any return on their investment in the form of cash dividends. We are subject to compliance with securities law, which exposes us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights. We may offer to sell our common stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as those of various state securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual; that is, the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering. We may not seek any legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law. Instead, we may elect t0 rely upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption, including information provided by investor themselves. If any such offering did not qualify for such exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired. It is possible that if an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were successful in seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally, if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies. 15 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of the Company. Though not now, we may be or in the future we may become subject to Nevada’s control share law. A corporation is subject to Nevada’s control share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and it does business in Nevada or through an affiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling interest” which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others. The effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share law. If control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder’s shares. Nevada’s control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation. In addition to the control share law, Nevada has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and “interested stockholders” for three years after the “interested stockholder” first becomes an “interested stockholder,” unless the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada law, an “interested stockholder” is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term “business combination” is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquiror to use the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders. The effect of Nevada’s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of Capital from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors. There is no current established trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop, purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their shares. There is currently no established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. While we intend to seek a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, there can be no assurance that any such trading market will develop, and purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so. No market makers have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so. Because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired. Opt-in right for emerging growth company We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 16 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Special Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this prospectus are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, the factors set forth above under “Risk Factors.” The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update and revise any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements in this document to reflect any future or developments. However, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 is not available to us as a non-reporting issuer and as an issuer of penny stocks. Further, Section 27A(b)(2)(D) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(D) of the Securities Exchange Act expressly state that the safe harbor for forward looking statements does not apply to statements made in connection with an initial public offering.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the status of and results from operations. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding for the fully implement our business plan. In the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority: - for general and administrative expenses, including legal and accounting fees and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting obligations with the SEC; - for research and marketing; - office lease expenses and office equipment; and - salaries for our Chief Executive Officer and the hiring of 1-2 additional full time employees Our current corporate offices are located at 1199 S. Federal Hwy, STE 136, Boca Raton FL 33432. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE Our management has determined the offering price for the common shares being sold in this offering. The price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily determined. The offering price bears no relationship whatsoever to our assets, earnings, book value or other criteria of value. The factors considered were: - our lack of significant revenues - our business model, and our lack of comparable publicly held companies to compare our model to - the price we believe a purchaser is willing to pay for our stock The offering price does not bear any relationship to our assets, results of operations, or book value, or to any other generally accepted criteria of valuation. Prior to this offering, there has been no market for our securities. DIVIDEND POLICY We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. DILUTION If you purchase any of the shares offered by this prospectus, your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the initial public offering price per share is substantially in excess of the book value per share attributable to the existing stockholder for the presently outstanding stock. As of March 31, 2015, our net tangible book value was $3,075 or $(0.0001) per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets (excluding deferred offering costs) less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at March 31, 2015. 18 ___________________________________________________________________________________ The following table sets forth as of March 31, 2015, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholder and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after deduction of offering expenses, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $0.05 per share of common stock. 25% of Offering Sold 50% of Offering Sold 75% of Offering Sold 100% of Offering Sold Offering Price Per share $ 0.05 $ 0.05 $ 0.05 $ 0.05 Post Offering Net Tangible Book Value $ 244,194 $ 494,194 $ 744,194 $ 994,194 Post Offering Net Tangible Book Value Per Share $ 0.0068 $ 0.0121 $ 0.0163 $ 0.0196 Pre-Offering Net Tangible Book Value Per Share $ 0.0001 $ 0.0001 $ 0.0001 $ 0.0001 Increase (Decrease) Net Tangible Book Value Per Share After Offering for Original Shareholder $ 0.0067 $ 0.0120 $ 0.0162 $ 0.0195 Dilution Per Share for New Shareholders $ 0.04 $ 0.04 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 Percentage Dilution Per Share for New Shareholders 87% 76% 68% 61% Capital Contribution by Purchasers of Shares $ 250,000 $ 500,000 $ 750,000 $ 1,000,000 Capital Contribution by Existing Shares $ 3,075 $ 3,075 $ 3,075 $ 3,075 % Contribution by Purchasers of Shares 98.78% 99.39% 99.59% 99.69% % Contribution by Existing Shareholder 1.22% 0.61% 0.41% 0.31% Gross Offering Proceeds $ 5,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 15,000,000 $ 20,000,000 Anticipated Net Offering Proceeds $ 4,975,000 $ 9,975,000 $ 14,975,000 $ 19,975,000 # of Shares After Offering Held by Public Investors 5,000,000 10,000,000 15,000,000 20,000,000 Total Shares Issued and Outstanding 35,750,000 40,750,000 45,750,000 50,750,000 % of Shares - Purchasers After Offering 14% 25% 33% 39% % of Shares - Existing Shareholder After Offering 89% 79% 72% 66% Assuming the Issuer sells the entire offer of 20,000,000 shares, after giving effect to the sale of common shares in this offering, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our as adjusted net tangible book value as of March 31, 2015 would have been $994,194, or $.0196 per share. This amount represents an immediate increase in the as adjusted net tangible book value of $.0195 per share to our existing stockholder and an immediate dilution in the as adjusted net tangible book value of approximately $.04 per share to new investors purchasing common shares in this offering. We determine dilution by subtracting the as adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of common stock. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION This prospectus relates to the sale of 20,000,000 common shares. We will sell the common shares ourselves and do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions. We will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no one has agreed to buy any of our common shares. This prospectus permits our officers and directors to sell the common shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to them for any common shares they may sell. There is no plan or arrangement to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the common shares with a broker or dealer. Our officers and directors will sell the common shares and intend to offer them to friends, family members and business acquaintances. There is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of our common shares will go into escrow, trust or another similar arrangement. 19 ___________________________________________________________________________________ The common shares are being offered by Nicholas Gaffney, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Director. Mr. Gaffney will be relying on the safe harbor in Rule 3a4-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to sell the common shares. No sales commission will be paid for common shares sold by Mr. Gaffney. Mr. Gaffney is not subject to a statutory disqualification and is not associated persons of a broker or dealer. Additionally, Mr. Gaffney primarily performs substantial duties on behalf of the registrant otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities. Mr. Gaffney has not been a broker or dealer or an associated person of a broker or dealer within the preceding 12 months and they have not participated in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months other than in reliance on paragraph (a)4(i) or (a)4(iii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The offering will commence on the effective date of this prospectus and will terminate on or before June 15, 2016. These are no finders. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, our common stock will come within the definition of a “penny stock” because the price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock will be subject to the "penny stock" rules and regulations. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the Commission’s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to: - Make a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser; - Receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction; and - Provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our common stock, and may affect the ability to resell our common stock. OTC Bulletin Board Considerations To be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. We anticipate that after this registration statement is declared effective, market makers will enter “piggyback” quotes and our securities will thereafter trade on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board is separate and distinct from the NASDAQ stock market. NASDAQ has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The SEC’s order handling rules, which apply to NASDAQ-listed securities, do not apply to securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Although the NASDAQ stock market has rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers, and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards, the OTC Bulletin Board has no listing standards. Rather, it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system, files the application, and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files. FINRA cannot deny an application by a market maker to quote the stock of a company. The only requirement for inclusion in the bulletin board is that the issuer be current in its reporting requirements with the SEC. Although we anticipate listing on the OTC Bulletin board will increase liquidity for our stock, investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because it is anticipated that if our stock trades on a public market, it initially will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board rather than on NASDAQ. Investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed. Trading activity in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with NASDAQ-listed securities. Investors must contact a broker-dealer to trade OTC Bulletin Board securities. Investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service. For bulletin board securities, there only has to be one market maker. Bulletin board transactions are conducted almost entirely manually. Because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the bulletin board, they are conducted via telephone. In times of heavy market volume, the limitations of this process may result in a significant increase in the time it takes to execute investor orders. Therefore, when investors place market orders - an order to buy or sell a specific number of shares at the current market price - it is possible for the price of a stock to go up or down significantly during the lapse of time between placing a market order and getting execution. 20 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Because bulletin board stocks are usually not followed by analysts, there may be lower trading volume than for NASDAQ-listed securities. There is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Blue Sky Law Considerations The holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful in having the Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities to be a limited one. There is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. We intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a "manual exemption”. This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer's balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. We may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a non issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin. We currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in other states which require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES The following description is a summary of the material terms of the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Common Stock We are authorized to issue 499,000,000 shares of common stock with $0.001 par value per share. As of the date of this registration statement, there were 30,750,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at meetings of shareholders. The holders are not permitted to vote their shares cumulatively. Accordingly, the shareholders of our common stock who hold, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the total voting rights can elect all of our directors and, in such event, the holders of the remaining minority shares will not be able to elect any of such directors. The vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon is sufficient to authorize, affirm, ratify or consent to such act or action, except as otherwise provided by law. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. We have not paid any dividends since our inception, and we presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained for development of our business. Any future disposition of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights or other subscription rights, conversion rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or windup, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to shareholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities. There are not any provisions in our Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws that would prevent or delay change in our control. 21 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Preferred Stock The articles of incorporation of the Company do not provide for the issuance of any other class of stock. Dividend Policy We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Share Eligible for Future Sale Prior to this offering, there was no public market for our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities. We have outstanding an aggregate of 30,750,000 shares of our common stock. Of these shares, only the 20,000,000 to be registered in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless those shares are purchased by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The remaining 30,750,000 shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted as a result of securities laws. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they have been registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Implication of the Applicability of Rule 144 Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 allows for the public resale of restricted and control securities if a number of conditions are met. Meeting the conditions includes holding the shares for a certain period of time, having adequate current information, looking into a trading volume formula, and filing a notice of the proposed sale with the SEC. In general, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the 90 days preceding, a sale, (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements and have filed all required reports for a least 90 days before the sale, and (iii) we are not and have never been a shell company (a company having no or nominal operations and either (1) no or nominal assets, (2) assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, or (3) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets). If we ever become a shell company, Rule 144 would be unavailable until one year following the date we cease to be a shell company and file Form 10 information with the SEC ceasing to be a shell company, provided that we are then subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that we were required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports. Persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or any time during the 90 days preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either of the following: - 1% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding, which would equal approximately 483,750 shares, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of April 24, 2015 (28,375,000), and assuming the 20,000,000 shares being registered in the Primary Offering are sold; or - The average weekly trading volume of our common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale. At the expiration of the one-year holding period, a person who was not one of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale would be entitled to sell an unlimited number of shares of our common stock without restriction. A person who was one of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale would remain subject to the volume restrictions described above. 22 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Sales under the Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Upon completion of the offering, Cathedral Stock Transfer will act as the registrant's transfer agent. BUSINESS OPERATIONS The company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 6, 2015. Our principal executive offices are located at 1199 S. Federal Hwy, Ste 136, Boca Raton FL 33432. The Company is currently in the developmental stage. Since inception the Company has had no revenues other than nominal interest income. As of the date hereof, the Company has no commercial operations, has no full- or part-time employees, and owns no real estate. Our current business plan is to research, investigate, and, if warranted, seek to acquire small and medium size technology companies, and to pursue other related activities intended to enhance shareholder value. The Company intends to concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it believes to be undervalued. We intend to seek opportunities where we may assist acquired companies with strategic growth plans and provide them with management strength and capital for growth, thus increasing their value. At the present time the Company has not identified any business opportunity that it plans to pursue, nor have we reached any agreement or definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given that limited funds are obtainable for acquisitions, or that any acquisition that occurs will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its stockholders. Due to startup costs, legal and accounting expenses, the company has suffered net losses of $10,709 from inception to March 31, 2015. Revenues The Company has had $3,606 in revenues since its incorporation on February 6, 2015. Target Markets and Marketing Strategy Our primary target market will consist of small to medium sized technology companies and other businesses that the Company feels may be undervalued. Because of our focus on undervalued companies, potential acquisitions may be: i) Recently organized with no operating history, or a history of losses attributable to under-capitalization or other factors; (ii) be experiencing financial or operating difficulties; (iii) be in need of funds to develop a new product or service or to expand into a new market; (iv) be relying upon an untested product or marketing concept; or (v) have a combination of the characteristics mentioned in (i) through (iv) above. We intend to market our services and discover potential acquisitions by utilizing connections from a variety of different sources, such as our officers’ business contacts, professional advisors, and other members of the financial services community. Competition The Company expects to encounter substantial competition in its efforts to locate attractive opportunities, primarily from business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, small investment companies, and wealthy individuals. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than us and will therefore be in a better position than us to obtain access to attractive business opportunities. The Company will also possibly experience competition from public "Blank Check" companies, some of which may have more funds available than does the Company. 23 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Intellectual Property At present, we do not have any patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, and royalty agreements, labor contracts or other proprietary interests. Research and Development We are not currently conducting any research and development activities aside from identifying and researching potential acquisition targets. Governmental Regulation We are not subject to any material government regulation. However, there is a risk that we could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also a risk that a change in current laws could adversely affect our business. In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Employees With the exception of Nicholas Gaffney we have no employees. We have no employment agreements with any of our management. Mr. Gaffney will devote his full efforts and as much time as needed when operations and funding are available. We may hire additional employees in the next twelve months on a commission basis only. We will hire necessary personnel based on an as needed basis only on a per contract basis to be compensated directly from revenues. Mr. Gaffney will work on a fulltime basis. Reports to Security Holders Through the filing of Form 8-A under the Exchange Act within 30-60 days following the effective date of the registration statement, we intend to become a fully reporting company under the requirements of the Exchange Act, and will file the necessary quarterly and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we will not be required to deliver our annual or quarterly reports to security holders, we intend to forward this information to security holders upon receiving a written request to receive such information. The reports and other information filed by us will be available for inspection and copying at the public reference facilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission located at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such material may be obtained by mail from the Public Reference Section of the Securities and Exchange Commission at 100 F. Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, at prescribed rates. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the Commission maintains a World Wide Website on the Internet at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Properties Our current corporate offices are located at 1199 S. Federal Hwy, Ste 136, Boca Raton FL 33432. Our telephone number is (561) 325- 3762. The rent on these offices is $800.00 per month. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS, AND CONTROL PERSONS The board of directors elects our executive officers annually. A majority vote of the directors who are in office is required to fill vacancies. Each director shall be elected for the term of one year, and until her successor is elected and qualified, or until her earlier resignation or removal. Our directors and executive officers are as follows: 24 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Name Age Position Nicholas Gaffney 26 Chief Executive Officer, Director Nicholas Gaffney, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director Mr. Gaffney is the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and founder of Capital Holdings Corp. Mr. Gaffney is a passionate entrepreneur with expansive knowledge in corporate structure and corporate governance of OTC traded public companies. Prior to founding Capital Holdings Corp, Mr. Gaffney worked for the Private Client arm of JPMorgan Chase. Mr. Gaffney will serve in his capacity as sole director until our next annual shareholder meeting to be held within six months of our fiscal year's close. Directors are elected for one-year terms. Code of Ethics Policy We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions. Corporate Governance There have been no changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. In addition to having no nominating committee for their purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert. Based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs. Family Relationships None Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings No officer, director, or persons nominated for such positions, promoter or significant employee has been involved in the last ten years in any of the following: · Any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time, · Any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses), · Being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities, · Being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. · Having any government agency, administrative agency, or administrative court impose an administrative finding, order, decree, or sanction against them as a result of their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity. · Being the subject of a pending administrative proceeding related to their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity. · Having any administrative proceeding been threatened against you related to their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity. 25 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Executive Compensation Since inception, we have paid our Chief Executive Officer $2,000. We may elect to award a cash bonus to key employees, directors, officers and consultants based on meeting individual and corporate planned objectives. We do not have any standard arrangements by which directors are compensated for any services provided as a director. No cash has been paid to the directors in their capacity as such. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth the ownership, as of the date of this prospectus, of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, our directors, and our executive officers and directors as a group. To the best of our knowledge, the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted. There are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control. The information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. Name Number of Shares of Common stock Percentage Nicholas Gaffney 15,000,000 48.75 % ABCO International Corp. 3,000,000 9.76 % Cynthia Gaffney 3,000,000 9.76 % Dynasty Automotive, Inc. 3,000,000 9.76 % Abigail Thompson 2,000,000 6.50 % Michael Gaffney 2,000,000 6.50 % Thomas Quinn 2,000,000 6.50 % All executive officers and directors as a group [1 persons] 15,000,000 48.75 % This table is based upon information derived from our stock records. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table and subject to community property laws where applicable, each of the shareholders named in this table has sole or shared voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS Director Independence The registrant's board of directors consists of Nicholas Gaffney. He is not independent as such term is defined by a national securities exchange or an inter-dealer quotation system. 26 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Advances from related party Nicholas Gaffney loaned a total of $2,162 to the Company for the month of March 2015. The loan was used to continue the operations of the business. Related party lease The registrant leases office space pursuant to a lease at 1199 S. Federal Hwy, Boca Raton, Florida.

INTEREST OF NAMED EXPERTS The legality of the shares offered under this registration statement is being passed upon by Adam S. Tracy, Esq., Securities Compliance Group, Ltd., 520 W. Roosevelt Road, Suite 201, Wheaton, IL 60187 (888) 978-9901. Mr. Tracy does not own any shares of the company. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form S-1. Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the forward-looking statements in this Registration Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects. Overview Capital Holdings Corp., or the Company, is a Nevada corporation formed on February 6, 2015. Our principal executive office is located at 1199 S. Federal Hwy, STE 136, Boca Raton FL 33432. Capital Holdings is a development stage technology holding and service company whose mission is to pursue suitable acquisitions for its portfolio. The company will identify small and medium technology companies and other businesses that the Company believes to be undervalued and may require assistance in their next phase of growth. We plan to assist acquired companies with management strength and capital for growth for the purpose of increasing value for our portfolio of subsidiaries. Since our inception we have engaged in the following significant operating activities: · Company set up a. Incorporate company in state of Nevada b. Set up main executive office in Boca Raton c. Open up bank account for the company j · Secured initial capital by a contribution from our founder, Chief Executive Officer and Director 27 ___________________________________________________________________________________ · Commenced significant other operational activities, such as: a. Have researched and identified potential acquisition targets b. Have drafted and began production of various marketing materials Plan of Operation The Company has not yet fully developed its plan of operations. The Company plans to perform its own research to identify undervalued technology companies that may be targets for acquisition. The Company also plans to rely on various other sources for business opportunities. These sources may include its officers, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, venture capitalists, and other members of the financial community, as well as others who may present unsolicited proposals. Our officers and directors will actively seek out potential acquisition opportunities in their ordinary course of business. We are highly dependent on the success of this offering to execute upon our plan of operations. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds through this offering or obtain alternate financing in lieu of funds raised through this offering, we may never complete development and become profitable. In order to become profitable we may still need to secure additional debt or equity funding above and beyond what we are seeking to raise through this offering. To such end, we hope to be able to raise additional funds from an offering of our stock in the future. However, this offering may not occur, or if it occurs, it may not raise the required funding. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding at present. Results of Operations For the period from February 6, 2015 (date of inception) through March 31, 2015 As a development stage company, we have had limited operations since inception. Our cash balance is $806.00 as of March 31, 2015 with $6,515 in liabilities . Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time without further revenue or proceeds from this offering. We may utilize funds from Nicholas Gaffney our Chief Executive Officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. Mr. Gaffney however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. We incurred expenses of $14,315 which is comprised of, among other things, Payroll, Set-up, and Rent. This constitutes an aggregate loss of $10,709. The maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan. If we do not receive any proceeds from the offering, we may be compelled to seek a loan from Mr. Gaffney, who has informally agreed to advance us funds, however, he has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Income & Operation Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. Net Loss We incurred net losses of ($10,709) for the period from February 6, 2015 to March 31, 2015. Controls and Procedures We are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls. We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not completed an assessment, nor have our auditors tested our systems of internal controls. 28 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Because it will take time, management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operations, we may incur significant expense in meeting our public reporting responsibilities, particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing, or remediating internal and disclosure controls. Doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting. Once our management’s report on internal controls is complete, we will retain our independent auditors to audit and render an opinion on such report when required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The independent auditors may identify additional issues concerning our operations while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations As of March 31, 2015 we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. Development Stage and Capital Resources Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and staff and raising capital. Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development stage . The Company has generated minimal revenues from operations and therefore lacks meaningful capital reserves. We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our operating expenses for the next 12 months. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation. While we have minimal revenues as of this date, no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our full plan of operations. We must raise cash to implement our strategy to grow and expand our ability to acquire target companies. The minimum amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $20,000.00. We are highly dependent upon the success of this offering, as described herein. Therefore, the failure of this offering to raise sufficient working capital would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible for the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities, or secure a loan, the Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors would lose all of their investment. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement the business plan and may impede the speed of its operations. Liquidity As of March 31, 2015 Current Ratio* .19 Total Debt/Equity Ratio** -9.18 Total Working Capital*** -3,547 ______ *Current Ratio = Current Assets /Current Liabilities. ** Total Debt / Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders’ Equity. *** Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities. 29 ___________________________________________________________________________________ DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant as provided in the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Market Information There is no established public trading market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop, or if developed, may not be sustained. A shareholder in all likelihood, therefore, will not be able to resell her or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resales. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular trading market develops. Penny Stock Considerations Our shares will be "penny stocks", as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Thus, our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. In addition, under the penny stock regulations, the broker-dealer is required to: Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt; Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities; Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer's account, the account's value, and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer's account. Because of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our Common Stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market, and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities, if our securities become publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities. 30 ___________________________________________________________________________________ OTC Bulletin Board Qualification for Quotation To have our shares of Common Stock on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our Common Stock. We have engaged in preliminary discussions with a FINRA Market Maker to file our application on Form 211 with FINRA, but as of the date of this Prospectus, no filing has been made. Based upon our counsel's prior experience, we anticipate that after this registration statement is declared effective, it will take approximately 2 - 8 weeks for FINRA to issue a trading symbol and allow sales of our Common Stock under Rule 144. There is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Dividends We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. We plan to retain any future earnings for use in our business. Any decisions as to future payments of dividends will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other facts, as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Reports to Shareholders As a result of this offering and assuming the registration statement is declared effective before June 30, 2015 as required under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission through June 30, 2016. At or prior to June 30, 2016, we intend voluntarily to file a registration statement on Form 8-A which will subject us to all of the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act. This will require us to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the SEC. In addition, our officers, directors and 10% stockholders will be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading activity. We are not required under Section 12(g) or otherwise to become a mandatory 1934 Act filer unless we have more than 500 shareholders and total assets of more than $10 million on September 30, 2015. If we do not file a registration statement on Form 8-A at or prior to June 30, 2015, we will continue as a voluntary reporting company and will not be subject to the proxy statement or other information requirements of the 1934 Act, our securities can no longer be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, and our officers, directors and 10% stockholders will not be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading activity. Where You Can Find Additional Information We have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-1. For further information about us and the shares of common stock to be sold in the offering, please refer to the registration statement and the exhibits and schedules thereto.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capital Holding Corp as of March 31, 20145 and the period February 14, 2015 (inception) through March 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 9, the Company has only two weeks operating history and has incurred losses since inception of $709 and has a working capital deficit of $3,547. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also discussed in Note 9. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Organization, History and Business Capital Holdings Corp. (“the Company”) was incorporated in February 6, 2015. The Company was established for the purpose of strategic acquisitions and holding company in the United States. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition Revenue is derived from sales of products to distributors and consumers. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,” as revised by SAB No. 104. As such, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred, the price is fixed or readily determinable, and collectability is probable. Sales are recorded net of sales discounts and terms are recorded by contract. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable is reported at the customers’ outstanding balances, less any allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not accrued on overdue accounts receivable. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts An allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate to cover any probable losses. Management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on historical write-off percentages and information collected from individual customers. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance when collectability is determined to be permanently impaired. Stock Based Compensation When applicable, the Company will account for stock-based payments to employees in accordance with ASC 718, “Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Stock-based payments to employees include grants of stock, grants of stock options and issuance of warrants that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock-based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, “Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.” Stock-based payments to non-employees include grants of stock, grants of stock options and issuances of warrants that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the value of the vested portion of the award over the requisite service period as measured at its then-current fair value as of each financial reporting date. The Company calculates the fair value of option grants and warrant issuances utilizing the Binomial pricing model. The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time stock options are granted and warrants are issued to employees and non-employees, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock option or warrant. The Company estimates forfeiture rates for all unvested awards when calculating the expense for the period. In estimating the forfeiture rate, the Company monitors both stock option and warrant exercises as well as employee termination patterns. The resulting stock-based compensation expense for both employee and non-employee awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which the Company expects to receive the benefit, which is generally the vesting period. 38 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Income per Share The Company reports earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260-10, " Earnings per Share ." Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted earnings per share has not been presented since there are no dilutive securities. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purpose of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include all stable, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company primarily transacts its business with one financial institution. The amount on deposit in that one institution may from time to time exceed the federally-insured limit. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Business segments ASC 280, “Segment Reporting” requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company’s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company determined it has one operating segment as of February 6, 2015. Income Taxes The Company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes .” The method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 is an asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting bases of other assets and liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability to the Company. Where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequence of the change to its financial statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s financials properly reflect the change. The Company currently does not have any recent accounting pronouncements that they are studying and feel may be applicable. Organization and Offering Cost The Company has a policy to expense organization and offering cost as incurred. To date for period February 6, 2014(inception) through March 31, 2015 the Company has incurred $7,500 in organization cost and offering cost 39 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Note 3. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The effective tax rate on the net loss before income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate as follows: 3/31/2015 U.S statutory rate 34 % Less valuation allowance (34 )% Effective tax rate 0 % The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 3/31/2015 Deferred tax assets Net operating losses $ (10,709) Deferred tax liability - Net deferred tax assets 3,641 Less valuation allowance (3,641 ) Deferred tax asset - net valuation allowance $ - On an interim basis, the Company has a net operating loss carryover of approximately $10,709 available to offset future income for income tax reporting purposes, which will expire in various years through 2032, if not previously utilized. However, the Company’s ability to use the carryover net operating loss may be substantially limited or eliminated pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48, and “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. The Company had no material unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities as of March 31, 2015. The Company’s policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as general and administrative expense but to identify them for tax purposes. During the period of February 6, 2015, (inception) through March 31, 2015, there were no income tax, or related interest and penalty items in the income statement, or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Nevada state jurisdiction. We are not currently involved in any income tax examinations. Note 4.

As of March 31, 2015 the Company had 30,250,000 shares issued and outstanding. Note 6.

Note 7 – Net Income(Loss) Per Share The following table sets forth the information used to compute basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Capital Holdings Corp. for the period Feb 6, 2015 (inception) through March 31, 2015: 2015 Net Income (Loss) $ (10,709) Weighted-average common shares outstanding basic: Weighted-average common stock 30,250,000 Equivalents Stock options 0 Warrants 0 Convertible Notes 0 Weighted-average common shares outstanding- Diluted 30,250,000 41 ___________________________________________________________________________________ Note 9. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. Currently, the Company has no operating history and has an operating loss of $ 10,709, and as of March 31, 2015 the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,547 and an accumulated deficit of $709. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that the Company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the Company’s development efforts and its efforts to raise capital. Management also believes the Company needs to raise additional capital for working capital purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be available in the future. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Pursuant to Nevada law, this includes elimination of liability for monetary damages for breach of the directors’ fiduciary duty of care to our Company and its stockholders. These provisions do not eliminate the directors’ duty of care and, in appropriate circumstances, equitable remedies such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief will remain available under Nevada law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement. (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 45 ___________________________________________________________________________________ (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: (i) If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) may be permitted to our directors, officer and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officer, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officer, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 46 ___________________________________________________________________________________ SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized in the city of Boca Raton, Florida on June 30, 2015.
