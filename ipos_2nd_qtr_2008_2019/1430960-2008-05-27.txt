All material risks are discussed in this section. Risks Related to our Business Our lack of operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance. We have no operating history. We have not generated any revenues. Our business plan is speculative and unproven. There is no assurance that we will be successful in executing our business plan or that even if we successfully implement our business plan, we will ever generate revenues or profits, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business. As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in sales, revenues or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we may never generate revenues or become profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of revenues and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations. Our lack of operating history and revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations. Our management has limited experience in managing the day to day operations of a public company and, as a result, we may incur additional expenses associated with the management of our company. The management team, including Jiangfeng Ding and Yaru Huang, our CEO and CFO , is responsible for the operations and reporting of the combined company. The requirements of operating as a small public company are new to the management team and the employees as a whole. This may require us to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned. We may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements and compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Although we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Section 404") requires our management to report on the operating effectiveness of the Company's Internal Controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2008. Enterprise CPAs, Ltd. , our independent registered public accounting firm, will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with the year ended December 31, 2008. We must establish an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We expect that the cost of this program will require us to incur expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. 10 It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take to complete Management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and process on a timely basis. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our shares will be affected. Any decrease in the availability, or increase in the cost, of appliance parts we purchase for resale could materially affect our earnings. Our operations depend heavily on the availability of appliance parts we resell. We purchase all of the parts we resell from Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd., an affiliate. However, if Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. isunable or unwilling to provide us with appliance parts on terms favorable to us, we may be unable to produce certain products. This could result in a decrease in profit and damage to our reputation in our industry. In the event our costs of acquiring these parts increase, we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers in full or at all. Any increase in the prices for thes could materially increase our costs and therefore lower our earnings. Our revenue will decrease if there is less demand for household appliances using our products. Our products mainly serve as key components in household appliances such as refrigerators. Therefore, we are subject to the general changes in economic conditions affecting the household appliance segments of the economy. Demand for our products is typically affected by a number of economic factors, including, but not limited to, consumer interest rates, consumer confidence, retail trends, sales of existing homes, and the level of mortgage financing. If there is a decline in economic activity in markets in which we operate or a decrease of sales of householder appliances, demand for our products and our revenue will likewise decrease. If our customers and/or the ultimate consumers of products that use our products successfully assert product liability claims against us due to defects in our products, our operating results may suffer and our reputation may be harmed. Our products are widely applied in the manufacturing of many household appliances, including refrigerators. Significant property damage, personal injuries and even death can result from malfunctioning products. If our products are not properly manufactured or installed and/or if people are injured as a result of our products, we could be subject to claims for damages based on theories of product liability and other legal theories in some jurisdictions in which our products are sold. The costs and resources to defend such claims could be substantial and, if such claims are successful, we could be responsible for paying some or all of the damages. We do not have product liability insurance. The publicity surrounding these sorts of claims is also likely to damage our reputation, regardless of whether such claims are successful. Any of these consequences resulting from defects in our products would hurt our operating results and stockholder value. 11 We depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key senior management could harm our business. Our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our senior management personnel, including Jianfeng Ding and Yaru Huang, our CEO and CFO. If we lose Jianfeng Ding and Yaru Huang, our CEO and CFO, if Jianfeng Ding and Yaru Huang, our CEO and CFO fails to perform in his or her current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, our business could suffer. Significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete our institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the product acquisition, marketing and sales aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Because we do business in China with the suppliers of parts we purchase for resale who are all located in China, the following risks could affect the business of our suppliers and thus harm our revenues. Changes in China’s political or economic situation could harm us and our operating results. Economic reforms adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of the country, but the government could change these economic reforms or any of the legal systems at any time. This could either benefit or damage our operations and profitability. Some of the things that could have this effect are: • Level of government involvement in the economy; • Control of foreign exchange; • Methods of allocating resources; • Balance of payments position; • International trade restrictions; and • International conflict. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, in many ways. For example, state-owned enterprises still constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy, and weak corporate governance traditions and a lack of flexible currency exchange policy continue to persist. As a result of these differences, the business of our suppliers could be adversely affected. 12 Our business is largely subject to the uncertain legal environment in China and your legal protection could be limited. The Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which precedents set in earlier legal cases are not generally used. The overall effect of legislation enacted over the past 20 years has been to enhance the protections afforded to foreign invested enterprises in China. However, these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent and are evolving rapidly, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors, such as the right of foreign invested enterprises to hold licenses and permits such as requisite business licenses. In addition, all of our executive officers and our directors are residents of China and not of the U.S., and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the U.S. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the U.S., or to enforce a judgment obtained in the U.S. against our Chinese operations and subsidiaries. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we and our suppliers must conduct their business activities. Only recently has China permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures. Future inflation in China may inhibit our suppliers’ to conduct business profitably in China, increasing their prices and potentially reducing our revenues. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 20.7% and as low as -2.2%. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products. The value of our securities will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB. The value of our common stock will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB, and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Currently, RMB is stronger than U.S. Dollars. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for our operational needs and should RMB appreciate against the U.S. dollar at that time, our financial position, the business of the Company, and the price of our common stock may be harmed. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of declaring dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings from our subsidiaries in China would be reduced. 13 In the event that the U.S. dollars appreciate against RMB, our costs will increase. If we cannot pass the resulting cost increase on to our customers, our profitability and operating results will suffer. In addition, since our sales to international customers grew rapidly, we are subject to the risk of foreign currency depreciation. Risks Related to the Market for our Stock Certain of our stockholders hold a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect certain corporate actions . Our officers, directors and majority shareholders are the beneficial owners of approximately 87.5% of our outstanding voting securities. As a result, they possesses significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions. Their ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer. If our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity. We anticipate that our common stock will be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ system. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. We may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our common stock becomes a “penny stock”, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock. 14 There can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest. Sales of our common stock under Rule 144 could reduce the price of our stock. There are 6,861,067 shares of our common stock held by non- affiliates and 32,129,760 shares held by affiliates Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 defines as restricted securities. 6,861,067 of our shares held by non-affiliates are currently eligible for resale or are being registered in this offering, however affiliates will still be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144. In general, persons holding restricted securities, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of at least six months, may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period, and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price. The availability for sale of substantial amounts of common stock under Rule 144 could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities. Because we do not have an audit or compensation committee, shareholders will have to rely on the entire board of directors, only one of of which are not independent, to perform these functions. We do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors. Indeed, we do not have any audit or compensation committee. These functions are performed by the board of directors as a whole. All members of the board of directors except one are not independent directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict in that board members who are management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. Special Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements in this prospectus are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update and revise any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements in this document to reflect any future or developments. However, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 is not available to us as a non-reporting issuer. Further, Section 27A(b)(2)(D) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(D) of the Securities Exchange Act expressly state that the safe harbor for forward looking statements does not apply to statements made in connection with an initial public offering. 15 USE OF PROCEEDS Not applicable.

Blue Sky Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have what is commonly referred to as a “manual exemption” for secondary trading of securities such as those to be resold by Selling Stockholders under this registration statement. In these states, so long as we obtain and maintain a listing in Standard and Poor’s Corporate Manual, secondary trading can occur without any filing, review or approval by state regulatory authorities in these states. These states are: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming. We cannot secure this listing, and thus this qualification, until after this registration statement is declared effective. Once we secure this listing, secondary trading can occur in these states without further action. All our shareholders currently reside in China and the above states, except Alabama and Illinois. We will make the appropriate filings in Alabama and Illinois, and comply with all secondary trading exemptions in such states, to permit sales of the securities registered in this offering. We currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in other states which require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders. 19 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Our common stock is currently not quoted on any market. No market may ever develop for our common stock, or if developed, may not be sustained in the future. Accordingly, our shares should be considered totally illiquid, which inhibits investors’ ability to resell their shares. Selling shareholders are offering up to 6,861,067 shares of common stock. The selling shareholders will offer their shares at $0.20 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. We will not receive any proceeds of the sale of these securities. We will pay all expenses of registering the securities. The securities offered by this prospectus will be sold by the selling shareholders without underwriters and without commissions. The distribution of the securities by the selling shareholders may be effected in one or more transactions that may take place in the over-the-counter market or privately negotiated transactions. The selling shareholders may pledge all or a portion of the securities owned as collateral for margin accounts or in loan transactions, and the securities may be resold pursuant to the terms of such pledges, margin accounts or loan transactions. Upon default by such selling shareholders, the pledge in such loan transaction would have the same rights of sale as the selling shareholders under this prospectus. The selling shareholders may also enter into exchange traded listed option transactions, which require the delivery of the securities listed under this prospectus. After our securities are qualified for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, the selling shareholders may also transfer securities owned in other ways not involving market makers or established trading markets, including directly by gift, distribution, or other transfer without consideration, and upon any such transfer the transferee would have the same rights of sale as such selling shareholders under this prospectus. In addition to the above, each of the selling shareholders will be affected by the applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, without limitation, Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the securities by the selling shareholders or any such other person. We have instructed our selling shareholders that they many not purchase any of our securities while they are selling shares under this registration statement. Upon this registration statement being declared effective, the selling shareholders may offer and sell their shares from time to time until all of the shares registered are sold; however, this offering may not extend beyond two years from the initial effective date of this registration statement. There can be no assurances that the selling shareholders will sell any or all of the securities. In various states, the securities may not be sold unless these securities have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of our securities. Pursuant to oral promises we made to the selling shareholders, we will pay all the fees and expenses incident to the registration of the securities. 20 Should any substantial change occur regarding the status or other matters concerning the selling shareholders or us, we will file a post-effective amendment disclosing such matters. OTC Bulletin Board Considerations To be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. We have engaged in preliminary discussions with an NASD Market Maker to file our application on Form 211 with the NASD, but as of the date of this prospectus, no filing has been made. Based upon our counsel’s prior experience, we anticipate that after this registration statement is declared effective, it will take approximately 2 – 8 weeks for the NASD to issue a trading symbol. The OTC Bulletin Board is separate and distinct from the NASDAQ stock market. NASDAQ has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The SEC’s order handling rules, which apply to NASDAQ-listed securities, do not apply to securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Although the NASDAQ stock market has rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of our issuers, and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards, the OTC Bulletin Board has no listing standards. Rather, it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system, files the application, and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in our files. The NASD cannot deny an application by a market maker to quote the stock of a company. The only requirement for inclusion in the bulletin board is that the issuer be current in our reporting requirements with the SEC. Although we anticipate listing on the OTC Bulletin board will increase liquidity for our stock, investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because it is anticipated that if our stock trades on a public market, it initially will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board rather than on NASDAQ. Investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed. Trading activity in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with NASDAQ-listed securities. Investors must contact a broker-dealer to trade OTC Bulletin Board securities. Investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service. For bulletin board securities, there only has to be one market maker. Bulletin board transactions are conducted almost entirely manually. Because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the bulletin board, they are conducted via telephone. In times of heavy market volume, the limitations of this process may result in a significant increase in the time it takes to execute investor orders. Therefore, when investors place market orders - an order to buy or sell a specific number of shares at the current market price - it is possible for the price of a stock to go up or down significantly during the lapse of time between placing a market order and getting execution. Because bulletin board stocks are usually not followed by analysts, there may be lower trading volume than for NASDAQ-listed securities. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There are no pending or threatened lawsuits against us. 21 DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS, AND CONTROL PERSONS The board of directors elects our executive officers annually.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following tables set forth the ownership, as of the date of this prospectus, of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, our directors, and our executive officers and directors as a group. To the best of our knowledge, the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted. There are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control. The information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. The business address of the shareholders is 800 West Fifth Avenue, Suite 210B, Naperville, IL 60563. 23 Name Number of Shares of Common Stock Percentage Jianfeng Ding [1] 14,498,880 37.185 % Yaru Huang [1] 14,498,880 37.185 % Ying Zhong 2,000,000 5.13 % All officers and directors as a group [4 persons] 32,037,960 82.17 % [1] Owned 14,498,880 shares in the name of Jianfeng Ding and 14,498,880 shares in the name of Yaru Huang, husband and wife. This table is based upon information derived from our stock records. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table and subject to community property laws where applicable, each of the shareholders named in this table has sole or shared voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned. Except as set forth above, applicable percentages are based upon 38,990,827 shares of common stock outstanding as of May 1, 2008. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES The following description as a summary of the material terms of the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws is qualified in our entirety. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Common Stock We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock with $0.001 par value per share. As of the date of this registration statement, there were 38,990,827 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by 134 shareholders of the record. Each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at meetings of shareholders. The holders are not permitted to vote their shares cumulatively. Accordingly, the shareholders of our common stock who hold, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the total voting rights can elect all of our directors and, in such event, the holders of the remaining minority shares will not be able to elect any of such directors. The vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon is sufficient to authorize, affirm, ratify or consent to such act or action, except as otherwise provided by law. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. We have not paid any dividends since our inception, and we presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained for development of our business. Any future disposition of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights or other subscription rights, conversion rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to shareholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities. There are not any provisions in our Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws that would prevent or delay change in our control. 24 INTEREST OF NAMED EXPERTS The financial statements for the period from inception to December 31, 2006 and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this prospectus have been audited by Enterprise CPAs, Ltd. which are independent certified public accountants, to the extent and for the periods set forth in our report and are incorporated herein in reliance upon such report given upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting. The legality of the shares offered under this registration statement is being passed upon by Williams Law Group, P.A., Tampa, Florida. Michael T. Williams, principal of Williams Law Group, P.A., owns 50,000 shares of our common stock being registered in this offering. DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES LIABILITIES Our Bylaws, subject to the provisions of Nevada Law, contain provisions which allow the corporation to indemnify any person against liabilities and other expenses incurred as the result of defending or administering any pending or anticipated legal issue in connection with service to us if it is determined that person acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed was in the best interest of the corporation.

Our business is the sale of appliance parts in Asia, Europe, North and South America. We have not generated any revenues from the sale of these products. We have been developing our infrastructure to begin to sell these products and anticipate that we will have sales and revenues commencing June 2008. Our Products We intend to sell the following types of appliance parts: · Automatic Refrigerator Build-in Icemaker: The automatic refrigerator build-in icemaker is designed for household refrigeration products, such as refrigerator, under-counter refrigerator, freezer to make the ice cubes automatically. · Refrigerator Through-Door Ice Water System: Refrigeration Through-Door Ice Water System is the system that stores the ice cubes harvested from the icemaker, delivered and dispensed the ice, crushed ice or water to the refrigerator door through the electronic control system at the front of the refrigerator door. The through-door ice water system normally includes the following assemblies: ice bucket assembly, motor rail assembly, module assembly, facade assembly, housing assembly. The ice bucket assembly and the motor rail assembly can be located in the freezer, in the refrigerator door and or sealed chamber in the refrigerator. The module assembly, facade assembly and housing assembly vary according to the specific design from each client. Our Supplier The products we will sell are manufactured in China by Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (“Zhong Nan Fu Rui”). It was established in 2005 specializing in home appliance components and subassemblies manufacturing, and located in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China. On June 8, 2007, Flurida Group, Inc. signed a five year distribution agreement with Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Zhong Nan Fu Rui is a Chinese manufacturing company owned 100% by Mr. Jianfeng Ding, our president. Under the terms of the agreement Zhong Nan Fu Rui authorizes Flurida to be its exclusive sales agent for the ice making product lines, including icemaker and ice water dispensing systems all over the world. The ice making product lines shall include the products that Zhong Nan Fu Rui developed before the agreement signed and the products that will be developed by both parties during the term of the agreement. Customers We intend to sell our products to refrigerator manufacturers such as Haier Group, Electrolux, Merloni Progetti, Siemens, GE Motors & Control, GE Lighting Systems, Texas Instruments, Mid-South Industries, Medea Group, Chunlan, Hisense Group, and Little Swan. Markets We intend to sell our products in United States, Mexico, Canada, China, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Holland, and Spain. 26 Marketing Our products will be sold directly by our officers, directors and employees to customers and potential customers. We will locate these customers primarily by personal contacts or referrals. Our Competition and Our Market Position Competition within the appliance parts industry is intense. We will compete with both large scale state-owned enterprises and smaller scale private companies. In addition, we also face competition from international appliance parts resellers. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Our major competitor in ice maker market is Japan Servo Co., Ltd. which is headquartered in Japan. Japan Servo develops, manufactures and sells consumer and industrial small motors, as fans, blowers and sensors, and motor application products. Japan Servo's Indonesia factory, PT.Japan Servo Batam produces an aluminum icemaker. We believe based upon our knowledge of the industry that we are about 25% the size of Japan Servo. Japan Servo currently primarily sells to GE and Electrolux in USA. Our other major competitor for ice maker and ice water dispensing system products is Mid-South Industries Inc. (MSI) Headquartered in Gadsden, AL, United States. MSI mainly designs, produces and sells automobile parts, telecommunication parts and refrigeration parts. MSI experienced a major financial problem in 2005 year which caused them to lose the businesses with Electrolux. MSI still produces a small volume of icemaker and has the capability to design and produce icemaker and ice water system products. We compete with these and other suppliers based upon: (1) Our larger and more focused design group (2) We offer a wider range of products. (3) We sell in a broader market throughout the world while Japan Servo Co. Ltd.’s ice maker products are only sold in US. Research and Development We have not incurred research and development expenses in the last two fiscal years. Our Intellectual Property We have no intellectual property. Our Employees We have the following number of full time employees: Clerical – 0 Operations – 5 Administrative – 1 Management – 3 Sales – 1 27 We have no part time employees. We have no collective bargaining agreement with our employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent.

We anticipate this trend to continue and may adjust our unit price upward to reduce the impact of rising costs.

We expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we initiate a number of marketing and promotional activities. 30 Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., while the subsidiary in Italy is subject to the income tax laws of Italy. The representative sales office in China is not subject to Chinese income tax.

Commitments and Contingencies The Company has signed a long-term distribution agreement with Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Zhong Nan Fu Rui is a Chinese manufacturing company owned 100% by Mr. Jianfeng Ding, also the founder of Flurida Group, Inc. Foreign Currency Translation The Company has determined the United States dollars to be its functional currency for Flurida Group USA; People’s Republic of China Chinese Yuan Renminbi to be its functional currency in Flurida Qingdao office; and European Euro to be its functional currency. Assets and liabilities were translated to U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rate. The exchange rate of issuance of common stocks to shareholders was used as one U.S. dollar to 7.5 Chinese Yuan (RMB). Statement of operations amounts were translated to U.S. dollars using the historic rate, i.e., the rate at first date of each month during the year. Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

The total debt of $1,179,547 for December 31, 2007 includes the $1500 initial organization cost loan from shareholders, plus the loan $1,178,047 from shareholders convertible to common shares at the annual interest rate of 8%. As of March 25, 2008, $2000 loan received for convertible 20,000 common shares at $0.10, the total loan amount convertible to common shares increase to $1,180,046.67.

(“Zhong Nan Fu Rui”). It was established in 2005 specializing in home appliance components and subassemblies manufacturing, and located in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China. On June 8, 2007, Flurida Group, Inc. signed a five year distribution agreement with Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Zhong Nan Fu Rui is a Chinese manufacturing company owned 100% by Mr. Jianfeng Ding, our president. Under the terms of the agreement Zhong Nan Fu Rui authorizes Flurida to be its exclusive sales agent for the ice making product lines, including icemaker and ice water dispensing systems all over the world. The ice making product lines shall include the products that Zhong Nan Fu Rui developed before the agreement signed and the products that will be developed by both parties during the term of the agreement. We have not yet purchased any products from Zhong Nan Fu Rui. We believe the purchase price we will pay for these products will be comparable to what we would have paid a non-related party in arm’s-length transactions. We rent the following property from Mr. Ding: Flurida Group Qingdao Office. The rent is approximately $250 per month. We believe the rent paid for this space was comparable to what we would have paid a non-related party in arm’s-length transactions. Except as set forth above, we have not entered into any material transactions with any director, executive officer, and promoter, beneficial owner of five percent or more of our common stock, or family members of such persons. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Market Information There is no established public trading market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop, or if developed, may not be sustained. A shareholder in all likelihood, therefore, will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resales. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular trading market develops. We have no plans, proposals, arrangements, or understandings with any person with regard to the development of a trading market in any of our securities. Options, Warrants, Convertible Securities There are no options, warrants or convertible securities outstanding. Penny Stock Considerations Our shares will be "penny stocks" as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Our shares thus will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited investor must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. Generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000, or annual income exceeding $100,000 individually or $300,000 together with his or her spouse, is considered an accredited investor. In addition, under the penny stock regulations the broker-dealer is required to: 34 · Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commissions relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt; · Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities; · Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer's account, the account's value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and · Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer's account. Because of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities, if our securities become publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities. OTC Bulletin Board Qualification for Quotation To have our shares of common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. We have engaged in preliminary discussions with an NASD Market Maker to file our application on Form 211 with the NASD, but as of the date of this prospectus, no filing has been made. Based upon our counsel’s prior experience, we anticipate that after this registration statement is declared effective, it will take approximately 2 – 8 weeks for the NASD to issue a trading symbol. Sales of our common stock under Rule 144. Once this registration statement is effective, the shares of our common stock being offered by our selling shareholders will be freely tradable without restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, except for any shares held by our "affiliates," which will be restricted by the resale limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. There are 6,861,067 shares of our common stock held by non- affiliates and 32,192,760 shares held by affiliates Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 defines as restricted securities. 6,861,067 of our shares held by non-affiliates are currently eligible for resale or are being registered in this offering, however affiliates will still be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144. In general, persons holding restricted securities, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of at least six months, may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period, and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price. The availability for sale of substantial amounts of common stock under Rule 144 could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities. 35 Holders As of the date of this registration statement, we had approximately 134 shareholders of record of our common stock. Dividends We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. We plan to retain any future earnings for use in our business. Any decisions as to future payments of dividends will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other facts, as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Reports to Shareholders As a result of this offering, we will become subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and will file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission through December 31, 2005, assuming this registration statement is declared effective before that date. Thereafter, we will continue as a voluntary reporting company and will not be subject to the proxy statement or other information requirements of the 1934 Act. We are not required under Section 12(g) or otherwise to become a mandatory 1934 Act filer due to the fact we have less than 300 shareholders. If we subsequently decide to cease filing reports, our securities can no longer be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. We will voluntarily send an annual report to shareholders containing audited financial statements. Where You Can Find Additional Information We have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form SB-2 statement. For further information about us and the shares of common stock to be sold in the offering, please refer to the registration statement and the exhibits and schedules thereto. The registration statement and exhibits may be inspected, without charge, and copies may be obtained at prescribed rates, at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE B – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting The financial statements reflect the assets, revenues and expenditures of the Company on the accrued basis of accounting. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Flurida Group USA, Flurida Group Qingdao Office, and Flurida Group European S.R.L. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Foreign Currency Translation The Company has determined the United States dollars to be its functional currency for Flurida Group USA; People’s Republic of China Chines Yuan Renminbi to be its functional currency in Flurida Qingdao office; and European Euro to be its functional currency. Assets and liabilities were translated to U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rate. Statement of operations amounts were translated to U.S. dollars using the first date of each month during the year. Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Property, Plant, and Equipment Depreciation Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is being provided principally by straight line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. As of December 31, 2007, there were no fixed assets in the Company’s balance sheets. 47 FLURIDA GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Organization Cost and Amortization The Company incurred certain legal fee and organization cost for setting up Flurida Group, Inc. in the State of Nevada, and the Company was incorporated on December 19, 2006, the cost was $1500.00 which was amortized by straight line method over 5 years since 2006. Flurida Group European S.R.L. was established in December 2007, and the organization cost was $12,058, which was amortized by straight line method over 5 year periods since December 2007. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock issued for services using the fair value method. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 96-98, the measurement date of shares issued for services is the date at which the counterparty’s performance is complete. Net Income Per Common Share The Company computes per share amounts in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share”. SFAS No. 128 requires presentation of basis and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to Common Shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods. Income Tax The Company filed extension for corporate tax return Form 1120 to Internal Revenue Service and IL 1120 to the State of Illinois. There is no income tax for the State of Nevada. China’s Qingdao representative office expenditures will be reported in the Company’s U.S. tax return Form 1120. Flurida Group European will report income tax return to Italy government. Payroll Expense In 2006, and 2007, there were no active employees in the Company, accordingly, there was no payroll expense recorded. 48 FLURIDA GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Loans from Shareholders From October to December 2007, the Company incurred short-term loans from shareholders. As of December 31, 2007, loan amount of $1,178,046.67, for the share at $0.10 convert to common stocks. If the loan is not converted to common shares, the Company will pay annual interest rate of 8%. Concentration of credit risk The Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which, at times, may exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 (SFAS 153), “Exchange of Non-monetary Assets.” SFAS 153 amends the guidance in APB No. 29, “Accounting for Non-monetary Assets.” APB No. 29 was based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured on their fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 amends APB No. 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 151 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operation. In December 2004, the FASB revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123 (R)), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” The SFAS 123(R) revision established for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. It does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees. For public entities that file as small business issuers, the revisions to SFAS 123 (R) are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after December 15, 2005. Adoption of SFAS 123 (R) is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 49 FLURIDA GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS no. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (“SFAS No. 154”) which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements-An Amendment of ABP Opinion No. 28. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. Specifically, this statement requires “retrospective application” of the direct effect for a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods’ financial statements, if it is practical to do so. SFAS No. 154 also strictly defines the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error revising previously issued financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The management believes that adoption of SFAS No. 154 will not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), and supplemented by FASB Financial Staff Position FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48, issued May 2, 2007. FIN 48 specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet; and provides transition and interim period guidance, among other provisions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and as a result, is effective for the Company in the fiscal year 2008. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for using fair value assets and liabilities, and expends disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The management believes that there is no material impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. 50 FLURIDA GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108, Quantifying Financial Misstatements (“SAB 108”), which expresses the Staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. Registrants are required to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements, including both carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements, on the current year financial statements. The financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material, after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 is effective for financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The management believes that there is no material impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. NOTE C – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Cost of Goods Sold The Company’s purchase cost is primarily from supplier, Zhong Nan Fu Rui Mechanical Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd., owned 100% by the founder of the Company, Jianfeng Ding. The management believes that the purchase price for the parts will be market price. 51 FLURIDA GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE C – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (Continued) Loans from Officers and Directors Since the date of Company’s inception on December 19, 2006, the officers and directors have advanced the Company for the amount of $ 609,200 (Table I) at December 31, 2007. Table I Name Title Loans Amount Jianfeng Ding CEO $ 300,000.00 Yaru Huang CFO Ying Zhong Chief Representative, China Office $ 200,000.00 Fenglan Li Financial Manager $ 15,000.00 Fuling Li Operation Manager $ 10,000.00 Xiaoyong Fu Board Member $ 75,000.00 Gian Franco Barbieri Manager Director, Flurida Europe Company $ 9,200.00 Total $ 609,200.00 NOTE D – SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY On December 19, 2006, the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada, but no activities until August 20, 2007. 52 On August 20, 2007, two founders of the Company, Jianfeng Ding and Yaru Huang purchased 25,997,760 shares at $0.001 per share. The proceeds of $25,997.76 were received. On December 10, 2007, additional 1,294,000 shares were issued to other shareholders and sold at price of $0.05 per share. The proceeds of $64,700 were received. As of December 31, 2007, and March 31, 2008, there were total 27,291,760 shares issued and outstanding for the total stockholders equity of $92,986. NOTE E – GOING CONCERN The Company’s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations. However, due to the close relationship between the Company and it’s supplier, Zhong Nan Fu Rui, which is 100% owned by the founder, Jianfeng Ding, Zhong Nan Fu Rui’s current customers can be served by the Company for the same quality of products and services. Therefore, the management believes that the revenues will be generated to cover its operational costs and the risk of going concern in long term is significantly low. 53 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Flurida Group, Inc Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Contents Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement (unaudited): Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet 55 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations 56 Condensed Consolidated Statement Stockholder’s Equity 57 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 58 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement 59 54 FLURIDA GROUP, INC.

NOTE F – GOING CONCERN The Company’s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations. However, due to the close relationship between the Company and it’s supplier, Zhong Nan Fu Rui, which is 100% owned by the founder, Jianfeng Ding, Zhong Nan Fu Rui’s current customers can be served by the Company for the same quality of products and services. Besides, as of March 31, 2008, the cash and cash equivalent balance was $1,174,084 which was invested by shareholders. Therefore, the management believes that the revenues will be generated and its cash flows will be maintained to cover its operational costs and the risk of going concern in long term is significantly low. 64 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. 65 PROSPECTUS FLURIDA GROUP, INC.

Our Bylaws provide, in pertinent part, that the Company shall indemnify any person made a party to or involved in any civil, criminal or administrative action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or of any corporation which such person served as such at the request of the Company, against expenses reasonably incurred by, or imposed on, such person in connection with, or resulting from, the exercise of such action, suit, proceeding or appeal thereon, except with respect to matters as to which it is adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such person was liable to the Company, or such other corporation, for negligence or misconduct in the performance of such persons duties as a director or officer of the Company. The determination of the rights of such indemnification and the amount thereof may be made, at the option of the person to be indemnified, by (1) order of the Court or administrative body or agency having jurisdiction over the matter for which indemnification is being sought; (2) resolution adopted by a majority of a quorum of our disinterested directors; (3) if there is no such quorum, resolution adopted by a majority of the committee of stockholders and disinterested directors of the Company; (4) resolution adopted by a majority of the quorum of directors entitled to vote at any meeting; or (5) Order of any Court having jurisdiction over the Company.

With regard to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Corporation in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by a controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will be governed by the final adjudication of such case.
