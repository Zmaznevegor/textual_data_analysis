Unless we state otherwise, all information in this prospectus gives effect to our corporate reorganization discussed in "Corporate Reorganization" below. Our Company We are a rapidly growing wind energy company operating 282 megawatts, or MW, of electrical generating capacity with more than 950 MW of additional capacity that we expect to commence operations during 2008 and 2009. We are focused on developing, financing, constructing, owning and operating windparks in attractive energy markets in the United States. Our strategy is to grow our business principally through organic development in regions with deregulated power markets, acceptable wind resources and favorable legislative and economic incentives such as renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, programs and active renewable energy certificate, or REC, markets. Through RPS programs and REC markets, we are able to monetize the environmental attributes associated with our power, in addition to generating revenue from the actual power we produce. Operating in these attractive deregulated energy markets also enables us to execute our energy hedging strategy, which helps stabilize our revenues while allowing us to benefit from future increases in energy prices. We were founded in August 2004 and commenced operations of our first windparks in March 2008. We have grown into a fully integrated wind energy company with 152 employees, with the capability to develop, finance, construct, own and operate our windparks. We will utilize our understanding of the commodity markets to site our windparks in attractive regions and to monetize the output of our projects effectively. In addition to our current capacity of 282 MW, we have begun construction of additional windparks in New York and Texas that we expect will provide an additional 465 MW of capacity in 2008. We plan to grow our capacity significantly over the next several years. By the end of 2012, we expect to have approximately 3,850 MW of capacity as we further expand into attractive wind energy markets in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Vermont and Wyoming. In addition, we continuously identify and evaluate new windparks as part of our core business strategy. Windpark project development has been and will continue to be one of our core strengths and areas of focus. Based on our historical success in identifying new windpark projects, we expect that these project development efforts will result in an additional 4,000 MW development pipeline of windparks, which could be constructed after 2012. We also maintain strong relationships with major turbine suppliers, who we expect will provide the turbines required for our expanding windpark portfolio. We have secured access to the turbines needed for our projects slated for construction through 2009. We believe that the strong track record of our experienced management team, the expertise of our project development team dedicated to sourcing new opportunities, our integrated business model and our turbine supply relationships provide us with the knowledge and resources necessary to rapidly grow our windpark portfolio. 1 Growth in Our Windpark Portfolio (1) Capacity represents the maximum output, measured in megawatts, that an individual wind turbine generator is designed to produce. The capacity of a windpark equals the capacity of the generators multiplied by the number of generators included in the windparks. Our Windpark Portfolio Our operational project portfolio is located in New York and consists of three windparks: Bliss, Clinton and Ellenburg. We refer to these windparks as our Initial New York Windparks. Additionally, we have 465 MW of projects currently in construction in New York at our Altona, Bellmont, Chateaugay and Wethersfield windparks and in Texas at Phase I of our Great Plains windpark, all of which we expect to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also have 1,205 MW of projects currently in development, which we expect to commence operations in 2009 and 2010, and an additional 1,900 MW of projects in development, which we expect to commence operations during 2011 and 2012. Substantially all of these identified projects are located in attractive deregulated energy markets and in areas that we have determined have acceptable wind resources. For projects that we expect will commence operations between 2008 and 2010, we have secured control of the land necessary to construct our windparks, identified transmission interconnection and established relationships in the local communities. In addition, we have secured all of the turbines needed to support our projects slated for construction through 2009. For the majority of our 2011 and 2012 projects, we have secured a portion of the land necessary to place our turbines and have analyzed the characteristics of the applicable energy, capacity and REC markets. We have also performed preliminary wind analysis, identified transmission interconnection and initiated our public outreach process within the local communities. We continue to grow our windpark development pipeline and identify new potential projects every year through our integrated regional land, interconnection, market and meteorological development process. We identify new potential projects utilizing a cross-functional team consisting of development, commodities and engineering specialists to expedite our research process. This strategy allows us to quickly examine new areas for development, determine a potential project's viability and pursue windparks in attractive markets. Over the next five years, we estimate that our development team will identify approximately 4,000 MW of additional windpark development projects, which could be constructed after 2012. 2 A summary description of our portfolio follows in the chart below.

These numbers may vary based on a variety of factors discussed elsewhere in this prospectus. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 13 of this prospectus. (2) This megawatt number represents the net megawatts allocated to us after deducting the anticipated 25% interest of our potential partner in the development of this project. The size of the windpark to be developed at Granite Reliable is expected to be 99 MW. 3 Market Opportunity From its beginnings in California, wind energy in the U.S. has expanded steadily to 35 of the 50 states. Additionally, the total capacity of U.S. windparks increased by a factor of more than six from 2,500 MW to over 16,800 MW between December 1999 and December 2007. Despite this growth, wind energy generation still only represented just under 1% of U.S. electricity supply in 2006, and we believe that the prospects for further growth are very favorable. According to Emerging Energy Research, wind energy could provide approximately 50,000 MW of capacity in the U.S. by 2015. We believe that the key drivers for this growth trend are as follows:  Increases in electricity demand coupled with the rising cost of fossil fuels used for conventional energy generation;  Heightened environmental concerns, including legislative and popular support to reduce carbon dioxide, or CO 2 , emissions and other greenhouse gases;  Regulatory mandates, such as state RPS programs, as well as federal tax incentives including production tax credits, or PTCs, and accelerated tax depreciation that benefit wind energy generators;  Improvements in wind energy technology;  Increasing obstacles to the construction of conventional fuel plants; and  Abundant wind resources in attractive energy markets within the U.S. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that the following strengths position us to profitably grow our windpark portfolio in the rapidly developing U.S. wind energy market: High-quality portfolio of operating, in-construction and in-development windparks located in attractive U.S. energy markets We believe that our strategically located portfolio of operating, in-construction and in-development windparks ideally positions us within the rapidly growing U.S. wind energy market. Furthermore, we expect that our development portfolio will give us significant scale across a geographically diverse national footprint. We carefully select our project sites to ensure that they are in regions characterized by acceptable wind resources, high power prices in deregulated energy markets and favorable renewable energy policies. We believe our management's experience in developing windparks in new markets and adding projects in our existing markets will enable us to continue to successfully expand our development portfolio. Additionally, we believe our management's understanding of deregulated energy markets enables us to maximize the value of our development portfolio. Fully integrated in-house capabilities to develop, finance, construct, own and operate windparks and to support the continuing growth of our portfolio Our fully integrated, cross-functional organizational structure enables us to develop, finance, construct, own and operate each of our projects with a long-term ownership perspective. Our commodities and risk management team works closely with our developers and meteorological team on identifying regions for optimal project development. Collaboration among the developers, engineers and managers on each of our projects allows us to transition from one stage to the next and to regularly identify process and technical improvements over the life-cycle of each project. We have a dedicated development team of 33 professionals engaged in activities including site selection, market analysis, land acquisition, community relations and permitting. We also have significant engineering and construction, or E&C, and operations and maintenance, or O&M, expertise, through our combined 4 teams of 68 employees. Finally, our management team has extensive project finance and commodity hedging expertise, allowing us to optimize our capital structure and reduce the impact of spot market energy price volatility. This integrated project management strategy will enable us to continuously improve the development timing, cost and capital structure and revenue optimization of projects across our portfolio. Experienced and proven management team with an average of more than 20 years of experience with complex power projects Our management team has extensive knowledge of every aspect of the development, financing, construction and operation of windparks, as well as many years of experience in traditional independent electricity generation. Our senior management has an average of over 20 years of experience and involvement in bringing domestic and international power projects online, from initial development through financing to ongoing operations and maintenance. Strong relationships with major turbine suppliers and all of the turbines secured to support our projects slated for construction through 2009 Access to wind turbines is a crucial factor in the ability of wind energy developers to build out their pipeline of projects. As a result of the rapid growth in the wind energy industry, developers are facing increased competition in procuring wind turbines. In order to address this issue, we have built strong relationships with major turbine suppliers and have successfully secured the turbines needed to support our projects slated for construction through 2009. Our exclusive turbine supplier to date has been General Electric, or GE. With over 6,500 GE 1.5 MW wind turbines installed worldwide, GE turbines have an established track record and a solid history of reliability. Each of our operating technicians undergoes an intense training program at the GE Wind Training Center to standardize maintenance practices and minimize variability of our maintenance procedures among our windparks. In addition to GE, we maintain an active dialogue with another turbine supplier, as well as with the suppliers of spare parts for our turbines. As we continue to grow our portfolio, we believe that our strong relationships, scale and purchasing power will enable us to continue to secure the turbines and related spare parts necessary to support our growth on favorable terms with respect to payment, pricing and flexibility. Substantial local presence and community stakeholder involvement in the markets in which we are active We maintain permanently staffed project offices in Altona, Arcade, Bliss, Churubusco and Fredonia, New York; Austin and Hitchland, Texas; Lancaster, New Hampshire; Ubly, Michigan and Rutland, Vermont. By maintaining these offices and becoming involved in local community affairs, we develop a meaningful local presence, which we believe provides us with a significant advantage when navigating the local permitting processes and helps to enlist the support of the local communities for our windparks. We believe that our local approach has enabled us to secure approvals and support for our projects in regions that have historically voiced meaningful opposition and has given us a significant advantage over competitors who are not as active in the local communities in which we are developing windparks. Business Growth Strategy We intend to implement the following strategies to profitably grow our windpark portfolio in the rapidly developing U.S. wind energy market: Focus development of wind capacity in attractive deregulated and geographically diverse energy markets We seek to develop windparks within geographically diverse, established and deregulated energy markets that have attractive energy pricing, strong RPS programs and, in many cases, capacity 5 payments. In implementing this strategy, we have initially focused on New York, Texas, New England and a limited number of other states, which meet this criteria. We intend to expand our operating wind generation portfolio by adding projects adjacent to our existing windparks and by entering into new markets. We believe that this carefully designed expansion plan will allow us to effectively leverage our existing resources while seeking development opportunities in new markets. Enter regional markets in scale, primarily through organic development Upon entering a market, we seek to become a leading wind energy operator and an influential voice within the region. We believe that our large scale projects will enable us to take full advantage of the benefits of our local presence and spread our costs over a large number of turbines. While we may opportunistically acquire existing or partially developed windparks, we expect to grow our portfolio primarily through organic development, which means developing each project in-house, from initial site selection through construction and operation. We believe that our organic development model is generally preferable to acquiring projects because of the time and risk related to finalizing development on a third party's project and the premium these opportunities attract in the current competitive market. Extract the efficiency benefits of our fully integrated business model We seek to maximize project efficiency and reduce costs by taking advantage of our in-house capabilities in development, financing, construction and operations. For example, in the construction phase, we believe our ability to choose between using outside providers and taking advantage of our in-house capability to act as a general contractor provides us significant flexibility in selecting the most cost-effective and strategically efficient option. Additionally, we will maintain a central warehouse of spare parts, which we believe will result in significant benefits, including increased operational flexibility, as we will not have to delay maintenance as a result of waiting for an item with a long-lead time to arrive. As our asset base grows, we believe we will achieve further cost reductions due to economies of scale in maintaining our windparks and purchasing components. Manage commodity price risk while retaining potential energy value We have implemented and expect to continue to implement financial hedges with respect to a significant portion of the energy we produce. The effect of these hedges is to help stabilize our revenue stream by reducing the impact of regional energy spot market price volatility. The long term price protection achieved through our hedging program benefits both us and our lenders by strengthening our ability to provide sufficient debt service coverage and as a result greatly enhances our ability to obtain debt financing under attractive terms. We can still benefit from future increases in power prices through our exposure to commodity prices on the unhedged portion of our energy production both in the initial stages of the project's life (as the actual energy volume generated by the projects is expected to be greater, on average, than the hedged volume) and in the time after the hedging arrangement expires. Furthermore, our strategy of entering into hedges around the time of the closing of financing for a windpark as opposed to pursuing power purchase agreements, or PPAs, allows us to potentially benefit from future energy price movements and avoid the cost and price competition involved in bidding on PPAs. Utilize debt and tax equity finance structures In our selection of the various financing alternatives generally available to wind energy developers, we seek to maximize the rate of return on our project investments and monetize the tax benefits that we currently cannot utilize due to our lack of taxable income. We attempt to finance substantially all of our turbine purchases with debt secured primarily by the turbines themselves in order to increase our flexibility with respect to the specific projects in which turbines will be placed. We also use construction 6 and project debt financing to minimize recourse against the issuer while optimizing our use of third-party capital. Finally, we intend to use tax equity financing arrangements in order to monetize the value generated by the PTCs and accelerated tax depreciation that are available to us as a wind energy generator. We will be able to enter into these arrangements at a cost of capital that reflects the tax equity investor's ability to utilize these tax benefits. Until we have significant taxable income, we intend to continue financing our windparks with tax equity financing structures so long as tax incentives and tax equity investors remain available. Create relationships as a community stakeholder As part of our development strategy, we aim to create strong community relationships that we believe are critical to generating support and securing the land and permits necessary for our windparks. Our team works closely with the landowners who will host the windpark to ensure that they fully understand the impact of having turbines on their property. Throughout the development process, we assess and monitor the landowners' and broader community's receptiveness and willingness to host a windpark in their area. This proactive involvement in the community also enables us to submit permit applications that comply with local regulations while addressing local concerns. Attract, train and retain top talent As we continue to grow our business and add new windparks to our portfolio, we will need to attract, train and retain additional employees. We believe that our collaborative culture, fully integrated management model and internal human resource development abilities are critical to attracting new and experienced talent and retaining key team members, such as our engineers, developers and meteorology experts. We provide extensive training and we believe that we offer an attractive employment opportunity in the markets in which we operate. In addition, as part of our retention strategy, we will be issuing equity incentive awards to certain key members of our team in connection with this offering. Summary Risks There are substantial risks and uncertainties that may affect our financial and operating performance and our growth.

Corporate Reorganization Noble was founded in August 2004 by a group including our Executive Chairman, Charles Hinckley and our Executive Vice President, Development, John Quirke. We are currently a limited liability company. Our board of managers has approved our conversion into a Delaware corporation in connection with this offering. Pursuant to our corporate reorganization, all of our preferred units and common units will automatically be converted into shares of our common stock, and all shares of our common stock outstanding prior to the completion of this offering will be the result of this conversion. In this offering, we will sell shares of our common stock; however, our sponsors will continue to own in the aggregate % of our common stock (assuming that the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares) after the offering. Pursuant to our governance agreements, initially JPMP will have the right to designate directors (out of a total of initial board members), and subject to the receipt of regulatory approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, and New York State, CPPIB will have the right to designate directors. As a result, the sponsors will have the power to control our affairs and policies including with respect to the election of directors (and through the election of directors the appointment of management), the entering into of mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions. The number of sponsor- designated directors will be reduced as the sponsors' ownership percentage decreases. However, because our board of directors will be divided into three staggered classes and because the sponsors may retain a significant ownership interest in us, the sponsors may be able to influence or control our affairs and policies even after they cease to own a majority of our outstanding common stock. 8 Company Structure A summary chart of our company structure showing our main subsidiaries and projects in development, in construction and in operation following the completion of this offering is depicted below.

You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry We have a limited operating history and should be viewed as a development stage enterprise. We began our business in August 2004 and commenced operation of our first windparks in March 2008. We have a limited operating history from which you can evaluate our business, and our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by development stage enterprises competing in rapidly evolving markets, such as the renewable energy market. Some of these risks relate to our potential inability to:  complete the refinancing of our construction and equity bridge loans;  obtain all the land rights, turbines, transmission interconnection agreements, permits and approvals needed to construct and operate our windparks;  obtain adequate financing to develop our windparks;  construct our planned and future windparks within projected time and cost schedules;  commence and manage significant operations;  manage growth in personnel and operations;  manage our costs as we expand our business;  recruit and retain key personnel; and  anticipate and mitigate the other risks described in this prospectus. If we cannot successfully address these risks, our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer. We have not generated revenue and have generated net losses and negative cash flows from investing activities since our inception. For 2006 and 2007, we did not generate revenue, we incurred net losses of approximately $20.7 million and $42.5 million, respectively, and our net cash used by investing activities was approximately $507.1 million and $617.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, our accumulated deficit was approximately $72.0 million. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources to fund the development and construction of our windparks. To date, our capital expenditures and working capital requirements have been funded by project debt, turbine financings and capital contributions from our sponsors. We expect to incur substantial pre-tax losses over the next several years as we develop and construct new windparks, hire additional employees, expand our operations and incur the additional costs of operating as a public company. In addition, factors such as increases in labor or material costs, higher-than-anticipated financing costs for our windparks, non-performance by third-party suppliers or 13 subcontractors and major incidents and/or catastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes or storms, may cause us to experience increased costs with respect to our windparks. As a result, our net losses and accumulated deficit may also increase significantly. We expect to fund our future capital requirements out of cash on hand, operating cash flow, debt and tax equity financing and additional issuances of our equity securities. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate sufficient operating cash flow, we may have to reduce or terminate our operations. We are dependent upon the continued and uninterrupted operation of a limited number of operating windparks. We currently have only three windparks in operation, and we anticipate having only a limited number of windparks in operation over the next two years. As a result, our operations may be subject to material interruption if any of our windparks is damaged or otherwise adversely affected by one or more accidents, severe weather or other natural disasters. Our windparks may be subject to labor disruptions and unscheduled downtime or other hazards inherent in our industry. Some of those hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension or termination of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. In addition, all of our currently operating windparks are located in New York State. If any of our three operating windparks experiences material interruptions or if the regulatory environment or energy market characteristics in New York were to change in a manner adverse to us, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The federal government may not extend or may decrease tax incentives for renewable energy, including wind energy, which would have an adverse impact on our development strategy. Current federal tax incentives applicable to the wind energy industry include the PTC and accelerated tax depreciation for certain windpark assets. The PTC currently provides the owner of a wind turbine placed in operation before the end of 2008 with a ten-year credit against its federal income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity generated by the wind turbine. The accelerated depreciation for certain windpark assets provides for a five-year depreciable life for these assets, rather than the 15 to 25 year depreciable lives of many non-renewable energy assets. Currently, the PTC is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2008 and will not be available for energy generated from wind turbines placed in service after that date unless extended or renewed by Congress. Recent legislative efforts to extend the PTC have failed, and we cannot assure you that current or any subsequent efforts to extend or renew this tax incentive will be successful or that any subsequent extension or renewal will be on terms that are as favorable as those that currently exist. In addition, we cannot assure you that any subsequent extension or renewal of the PTC would be enacted prior to its expiration or, if allowed to expire, that any extension or renewal enacted thereafter would be enacted with retroactive effect. We also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing for accelerated depreciation of windpark assets will not be modified, amended or repealed in the future. If the federal PTC is not extended or renewed, or is extended or renewed at a lower rate, our financing options will be reduced and our development plans for additional windparks will be adversely affected. Even if the federal PTC is extended, we currently expect that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize the benefits generated by the federal PTC and there can be no assurance that we will be able to find other suitable tax equity investors interested in monetizing these federal tax benefits who meet our credit risk standards. Moreover, tax equity investors have finite funds, and wind energy producers compete with other renewable energy producers for tax equity financing. In the current rapidly expanding market, the cost of tax equity financing may increase and there may not be sufficient tax equity financing available to meet the total demand in any year. In addition, one or more current tax equity investors may decide to withdraw from this market thereby depleting the pool of funds 14 available for tax equity financing. Alternative financing will be more expensive and there may not be sufficient liquidity in alternate financial markets. As a result, our development plans for additional windparks would be adversely affected. Our use of tax equity financing structures will place certain limits on our project subsidiaries' operational flexibility and our rights to the cash flow generated by the windparks. We expect to finance our windparks with a tax equity financing structure. Under this structure, the tax equity investor is a member holding equity in the limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns the windpark. Our relationship with the tax equity investor will be governed by an operating agreement, under which we manage the day to day operations of the subsidiary, subject to the tax equity investor's right to approve the project's annual operating budget and most major management decisions. These approval rights include decisions regarding capital expenditures above certain levels, replacement of major contracts, bankruptcy and the sale of a windpark. As a result, the tax equity investor may prevent us from making certain business decisions that may be beneficial to us. In addition, the operating agreement typically will provide that for a period of time, all of the cash flows from the windpark will be distributed to the tax equity investor until it realizes a specified target rate of return, taking into account cash distributions, as well as the tax benefits and tax costs of its equity investment in the project. As a result, this structure reduces the cash flows available to us for other uses, and the period during which the tax equity investor receives all of the cash flows may last longer than expected if our windparks perform below our expectations. Our development plan requires substantial additional capital, and we may be unable to raise financing when needed or on acceptable terms, which could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our development plans. Each of our windparks under development and any additional windparks that we may seek to develop will require substantial capital investment. As a result, our continued access to capital on acceptable terms is necessary for the success of our development strategy. Our windparks are currently financed primarily using capital contributions from our sponsors and project financing structures, consisting of non-recourse or limited recourse debt. We intend to continue financing our windparks with project finance debt and, so long as tax incentives and tax equity investors are available, with tax equity finance structures, as well as with additional issuances of common stock. Market conditions and other factors, however, may not permit future financings on terms similar to those we have obtained to date or at all. Our ability to arrange for project financing on a substantially non-recourse or limited recourse basis or tax equity financing and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic and capital market conditions, credit availability from lenders, investor confidence, the adequacy of our equity investment in each windpark, our ability to forward sell or hedge the energy to be produced by the windpark, the success of our then-current windparks, the credit quality of the windparks being financed and the existence of regulatory and tax incentives that are conducive to raising capital. If we are unable to obtain financing for our windparks on a non-recourse or limited recourse basis, we may attempt to finance them by selling additional equity securities, which would cause dilution of our common stock. We can give no assurance, however, that any effort to sell additional securities will be successful or will raise sufficient capital to finance additional windparks. In the absence of available or acceptable financing, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all our development plans. 15 Our financial performance depends on policies and regulatory frameworks that support renewable energy development. The development and financial performance of our windparks are significantly dependent on state policies and regulatory frameworks that support windpark development. The states in which we are developing and plan to develop windparks currently provide various types of incentives that support the sale of electricity generated from wind energy. These policies include RPS requirements, which impose renewable energy purchase obligations or targets on electric utilities and other retail energy suppliers. We cannot assure you that government support for renewable energy will continue, or that the electricity produced by our future windparks will continue to qualify for support through these RPS programs. The elimination of, or reduction in, state government policies that support renewable energy could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial performance and our future development efforts. Our high levels of indebtedness could adversely affect our business. We have high levels of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $926.8 million of total consolidated indebtedness, of which approximately 70% represented non-recourse and limited recourse debt. We expect to continue to have significant debt and interest expense for the foreseeable future. The majority of our indebtedness relates to the acquisition of wind turbines and the construction of our windparks. The project financing that we use to fund the construction and operation of our windparks is limited recourse, and payment of the interest and principal on the financing is made primarily from the revenues generated by the windpark once operations commence through the sale of energy, capacity and RECs, as well as the monetization of certain federal tax benefits available to us. Our project and turbine financing documents contain covenants consistent with market practice that impose significant restrictions on the way we operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to:  incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness of others;  make certain loans or investments;  pay distributions or dividends to our stockholders, and receive distributions from our subsidiaries;  repurchase shares of our common stock; or  sell our assets. These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue other business activities that may otherwise be in our interest. Moreover, under our turbine financing agreements, most of our wind turbines and the equity interest in certain of our project subsidiaries are subject to first and second ranking security interests. As a consequence, even if we are permitted to incur additional debt under our existing financing agreements, to the extent any such financing would require security, we may have difficulty obtaining or may not be able to obtain financing because our available unsecured assets are insufficient to secure such debt. For additional information see "Description of Certain Financing ArrangementsSenior Secured Turbine Credit Facilities." 16 If our project subsidiaries default on their obligations under their non-recourse or limited recourse project finance debt, the issuer may be required to make certain payments to the relevant lenders and these lenders may foreclose on the collateral securing this debt, which could cause us to lose certain of our windparks. The debt for our windparks is non-recourse or limited recourse project finance debt. Non-recourse project finance debt refers to debt that is repaid solely from the project's revenues and is secured by the project's physical assets, major contracts, cash accounts and, in many cases, our ownership interest in the project subsidiary. Limited recourse project finance debt refers to the issuer's additional commitment to provide limited financial support to the project subsidiary in the form of limited guarantees, indemnities, capital contributions and agreements to pay certain debt service deficiencies. If our project subsidiaries default on their debt service obligations under the relevant project finance agreement, creditors of a limited recourse project financing will have direct recourse to the issuer to the extent of the issuer's limited recourse obligations. This may require the issuer to use distributions received by the issuer from other subsidiaries as well as other sources of cash available to us to satisfy these obligations. In addition, if our project subsidiaries default on their debt service obligations under the relevant project finance agreement and the creditors foreclose on the relevant collateral, we may lose our ownership interest in the relevant project subsidiary or the project subsidiary would only retain an interest in the relevant windpark, if any, remaining after all debts and obligations were paid in full. The loss of our ownership interest in one of or more our project subsidiaries would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently rely extensively on one of a small number of wind turbine manufacturers. Because demand for wind turbines and related components has increased significantly, we may face difficulties in obtaining or be unable to obtain delivery of wind turbines and related components at affordable prices or in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operation and financial condition. There is a small number of companies that have the expertise and access to the necessary components to build multi-megawatt class wind turbines. We currently have contracts in place with GE to purchase all of the required wind turbines for all of our windparks slated for construction through 2009. However, we have not yet contracted for wind turbines for our windparks in development for 2010 and subsequent years. The rapid growth in aggregate worldwide windpark installed capacity over the past five years, as well as the large number of windparks currently in-development, has created a surge in the demand for wind turbines and their related components that is currently not satisfied by suppliers. Wind turbine suppliers like GE have significant supply backlogs, which tend to drive up prices and delay the delivery of ordered wind turbines and components. Any delays in the delivery of ordered wind turbines and components may delay the successful completion of our windparks under development. Additionally, price increases may make it more costly for us to acquire wind turbines that are not covered by our current turbine supply agreements. We can provide no assurance that we will, in the future, be able to purchase a sufficient quantity of turbines and other technical equipment to satisfy our business plans, or that wind turbine and other component manufacturers will not give priority to other market participants, including our competitors. To the extent that GE or any other alternative wind turbine manufacturer becomes unable or unwilling to supply us with the wind turbines that we need to develop, construct and operate our windparks in accordance with our development plan and budget, we may be unable to find suitable replacements. If we are unable to acquire turbines to meet our development plan, it would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 17 The wind energy industry is characterized by intense competition, and we encounter competition from other wind power producers that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face significant competition from other wind energy developers and operators, and this competition may intensify in the future. We compete primarily for a limited number of sites that are desirable for windparks based on our development criteria. We also compete for the limited supply of wind turbines and other key equipment necessary to construct and operate our facilities. We also compete to recruit executives and employees, but may not succeed in doing so as we do not offer significantly greater salaries or benefits than any of our competitors. Moreover, our offices tend to be located in rural areas, which offer limited job opportunities for spouses of the executives and employees we seek to attract. Certain of our competitors have more experience in the wind energy industry, as well as much greater financial, technical or human resources than we do, which may limit our ability to compete effectively with them and to acquire or improve our market share. In particular, certain competitors who seek to expand in the renewable energy sector, including established producers in Europe and large utilities in the U.S., have greater financial strength than we do, which enables them to acquire new projects at higher prices and to purchase market share in the industry. We cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in the face of current or future competition. Our windpark development activities may be unsuccessful or delayed despite the expenditure of significant amounts of capital and management time and energy. Our success in developing a particular windpark is contingent upon, among other things, acquisition of rights to all necessary land parcels, receipt of required local, state and federal permits and the negotiation of satisfactory turbine supply, engineering and construction, interconnection agreements and financial commodity hedges or power purchase arrangements. We may fail to accomplish some or all of these milestones or may not accomplish them on a timely basis. In addition, we may modify the stated timing, size and geographic location of the windparks that are currently in development or that we may develop in the future. The development of a windpark typically requires us to incur significant expenses for land-rights acquisition, permits and legal and other services before we can determine whether a project is environmentally feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. For instance, we generally do not initiate the studies needed for an environmental impact study until approximately 18 months prior to the anticipated start date for the construction of a windpark. Currently, we have 34 identified windparks at various stages of development, and we intend to pursue the development of other windparks. Our successful development of these windparks is subject to substantial risks, including:  failure to obtain adequate real estate rights;  changes in the regulatory environment;  adverse changes in energy, capacity or REC market prices or liquidity that materially impacts our projected revenues;  unexpected environmental issues;  local community opposition to our proposed windparks; 18  failure to secure and maintain required regulatory, environmental and other necessary permits or approvals; and  failure to obtain approvals from transmission system operators for the interconnection of our windparks with their facilities or the excessive costs of interconnection. Any of these factors could lead to the termination of the development of a windpark after the incurrence of significant expense. We may be unable to timely complete the construction of our windparks, and our construction costs could increase to levels that could make a new windpark too expensive to complete or too unprofitable to operate. We experienced delays in the completion of the Initial New York Windparks and the total construction cost of these windparks exceeded our initial budget. We may suffer significant construction delays or construction cost increases as a result of a variety of factors, including:  failure to receive turbines or other critical components and equipment from third parties on schedule and according to design specifications;  failure to complete interconnection to transmission networks;  failure to receive quality and timely performance of third-party services;  increases in prices of goods and services;  failure to secure and maintain required regulatory and environmental permits or approvals;  inclement weather conditions;  adverse environmental and geological conditions;  unexpected environmental issues;  work stoppages or other labor disturbances;  shortages of labor;  personal injury or loss of life of our employees; and  force majeure or other events out of our control with respect to our windparks. Any of these factors could give rise to construction delays and construction costs in excess of our budgets, which could prevent us from completing construction of a windpark, cause defaults under our financing and revenue arrangements and impair our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, significant construction delays may also result in the loss of revenues expected to be generated by our windparks. For example, we have entered into contracts to sell certain of the RECs to be generated through the operation of our New York windparks to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA, the entity that administers the central procurement of RECs for the state of New York. Pursuant to our contracts with NYSERDA regarding our Altona, Bellmont and Chateaugay windparks currently in development, our ability to sell the RECs generated by our operation of these windparks may expire if the windparks are not in operation by November 2008. Delays in the commencement of operations of our windparks may increase our maintenance and operations costs. Delays in the commencement of operations of our windparks may result in increased operations and maintenance costs relating to routine maintenance or defects in the wind turbines at a windpark. 19 Our turbine manufacturer provides a warranty on each wind turbine; however, the warranty period ends the earlier of 24 months from the date the wind turbine is placed into commercial operation or 39 months from the date the wind turbine is delivered to us. For example, due to development delays, we may have less than one year remaining on the manufacturer's warranty for the wind turbines that will be installed at our Altona windpark which is currently in construction and scheduled to commence operation during the fourth quarter of 2008. The performance of our windparks is vulnerable to adverse meteorological and atmospheric conditions. The production of electricity generated by our windparks will be the source of substantially all of our revenues. As a result, our results of operations will be highly dependent on meteorological and atmospheric conditions. When we develop a windpark, we evaluate the quality of the wind resources at the selected site by a number of means, and we retain third-party experts to assist us in these evaluations. We use the wind data that we gather on site and data collected through other sources to develop wind resource projections for the windpark's performance, revenue generation, operating profit, project debt capacity, project tax equity capacity and return on investment, which are fundamental elements of our business planning. Wind resource projections at the time of commercial operations can have a significant impact on the level of third-party capital that we can raise, including the expected contributions by tax equity investors. We expect to commence commercial operations in connection with term conversion, which is discussed in more detail under "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements." Our wind resource projections do not predict the wind at any specific period of time in the future. Therefore, even in the event where our prediction of a windpark's wind resources becomes validated over time, the windpark will experience hours, days, months, and even years that are below our wind resource predictions. Our wind resource projections may not predict the actual wind resources observed by the windpark over a long period of time. Assumptions included in our wind resource projections, such as the interference between turbines, effects of vegetation and land use, and terrain effects may not be accurate. Our wind resources average monthly and average time of day long-term predictions may not be accurate and, therefore, the energy our windparks produce over time may have a different value than we had forecast. If as a result of inaccurate wind resource projections, the performance of one or more of our windparks falls below our projected levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Operational factors may reduce energy production below our projections, causing a reduction in revenue. The amount of electricity generated by a windpark depends upon many factors in addition to the quality of the wind resources, including but not limited to turbine performance, aerodynamic losses resulting from wear on the wind turbine, degradation of other components, icing or soiling of the blades and the number of times an individual turbine or entire windpark may need to be shut down for maintenance or to avoid damage due to extreme weather conditions. In addition, conditions on the electrical transmission network can impact the amount of energy we can deliver to the network. We cannot assure you that any windpark in our portfolio will meet our energy production expectations in any given time period. If our windpark energy projections are not realized, we could face a number of material issues, including:  our sales of energy may be significantly lower than we forecast;  the amount of capacity we would be permitted to sell from our facilities may be lower than we forecast; 20  our energy hedging arrangements may be adversely affected;  to the extent that we have entered into agreements for the sale of RECs with performance obligations based on our projected production, we may be unable to meet the obligations of these agreements, and as a result could receive less revenue than forecasted from sales of RECs;  we will be entitled to fewer PTCs than projected, which could, to the extent that we have tax equity financing in place, result in a reduction of payments from our tax equity investors in certain of our tax equity financing structures and an extension of the time period during which our tax equity investors receive the cash flow from our windparks; and  our windparks may not generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on principal and interest as they become due on our project financings. As we expand our operations, we may be unable to manage the development, construction and operation of future windparks effectively. Our planned expansion and any additional future expansion will place significant demands on our management, personnel, systems and resources. We plan to significantly increase our development, construction and operation of windparks and to hire additional employees to support these increases. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must effectively:  hire, train, integrate and manage additional construction, operations and finance personnel;  retain key executives and augment our management team;  implement and improve administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls;  expand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and  manage relationships with our landowners, suppliers and other third parties. We may encounter difficulties in effectively managing these and other issues presented by rapid growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. The number of desirable sites available for the development of windparks is limited, and our inability to identify or acquire sites will limit our ability to implement our development strategy. Windparks can be built only in regions with suitable wind conditions. In addition, certain constraints must be taken into account in connection with the development of each windpark. These include topographic constraints, landowners' willingness to grant us access to their land, connection capacities of the local transmission network and regulatory constraints associated with the proximity to housing, airports, protected sites or viewsheds. If these constraints on the development of windparks increase or if we cannot find or acquire sufficient available sites on which to develop our windparks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or on our ability to implement our business strategy. We may be unable to obtain control of and access to the real estate that we need for the construction and operation of our windparks. Windpark facilities, which include turbines, electrical collection systems and substations, are spread over large areas of land. We obtain rights to use land owned by others through leases, easements and other arrangements. If we are unable to secure the land rights we need at reasonable cost, we may have to redesign our projects, which may result in increased development and construction costs and delays in completing the windpark. In addition, we may be required to cancel or reduce the scope of a project if we cannot obtain all of the real estate interests. 21 The access to, availability and cost of transmission networks for our windparks are critical to our development efforts. We will depend on electric transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity that we will sell. We typically will not own or control the transmission facilities other than the limited facilities necessary to connect our windparks to the transmission network. The capacity of the local transmission network may be limited or constrained, and the owner of the network may not allow us to interconnect a new windpark without first constructing the system upgrades that the owner requires. For this reason, we expect to pay some or all of the costs of upgrading the existing transmission facilities to support the additional electricity that our windpark will be delivering into the network. The location of a windpark in a particular area therefore depends significantly on whether it is possible to interconnect with the transmission network at a reasonable cost. Many of our windparks in development will be located in remote areas with limited transmission networks where intense competition exists for access to, and use of capacity on, the existing transmission facilities. We cannot assure you that we will obtain sufficient network connections for future windparks within planned timetables and budgetary constraints. Our windparks are required to meet certain technical specifications in order to be connected to the transmission network. If any of our windparks do not meet, or cease to comply with, these specifications, we will not be able to connect, to or remain connected, to the transmission network. We may also incur liabilities and penalties, including disconnection from the network, if the transmission of electricity by one or more of our windparks does not comply with applicable technical requirements. In the interconnection agreements between our windparks and the applicable transmission owner and/or operator, the transmission owner and/or operator retain(s) the right to interrupt or curtail our transmission deliveries as required in order to maintain the reliability of the transmission network. We have no assurance that our windparks will not be adversely impacted by any such interruption or curtailment. We may incur delays in the process of negotiating our interconnection agreements for our windparks. Our windparks must apply for and obtain interconnection service from the owners and/or operators of the transmission networks in the areas where we propose to develop windparks. In all of the regions where we are developing windparks, we are required to perform studies of the interaction between our windparks and the transmission network in order to satisfy the local transmission owner's and/or operator's technical criteria for interconnecting a new power supplier. The results of these studies will establish the nature and cost of the interconnection facilities that will be necessary to support the interconnection. In most of the regions where we plan to build windparks, the study process is governed by a set of interconnection rules imposed by FERC. These rules generally provide that once a developer has completed the technical study process and defined the facilities that are necessary to accomplish the interconnection, the developer has a right to interconnect the new facility, subject to the negotiation of an interconnection agreement that is acceptable to the owner and operator of the transmission system. We have in the past and may in the future experience delays in completing the negotiation process and executing interconnection agreements for our windparks. The reasons for these delays include, but are not limited to, our inability to deploy sufficient engineering resources to complete the design of the interconnection facilities in the time frames needed to support our construction schedules; the transmission owner's allocation of resources to other projects; the complexity of the system upgrades that may be needed at a particular location; variations in the technical specifications that different transmission owners may apply; and the activities of competitors, who may, under some circumstances, be treated as parties to an interconnection agreement negotiation under the applicable FERC rules. In addition, if we fail to meet the study process milestones set by the rules, we may lose our position in the transmission planning queue, with the possible result that our windparks may be required to restart the study process. 22 The transmission networks to which our windparks connect may fail or experience downtime, which will cause us to lose revenue. Transmission networks may experience congestion, outages or technical incidents, and operators of these networks may fail to meet their contractual transmission obligations or terminate the contracts involved. Moreover, if the interconnection or transmission agreement of a windpark is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to replace it with an interconnection and transmission arrangement on terms as favorable as the existing arrangement or at all, or we may experience significant delays or costs in connection with securing a replacement. If a network to which one or more of our windparks is connected experiences "down time," the affected windpark may lose revenue and be exposed to non-performance penalties and claims from its customers. These may include claims for damages incurred by customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity supply at then-current spot market rates. In addition, network downtime may also reduce the amounts we receive under the terms of any agreement to sell the RECs associated with the windpark. The owners of the network will not usually compensate electricity generators, including our windparks, for lost income due to down time. We rely on third parties to provide the working capital necessary to run our business. We require funds for working capital to pay for our ordinary course expenses, including salaries and benefits for our employees, and professional services fees. We have not yet begun to generate revenue from our windparks. Therefore, our working capital requirements to date have been funded by project-level debt and capital contributions from our sponsors. Because our project-level debt obligations reduce the availability of cash flow from operations, we do not expect that we will generate sufficient cash from our windparks to satisfy all of our working capital needs for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to borrow additional funds or obtain additional capital from existing or future investors, our existing working capital would be depleted, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Revenues from our windparks are exposed to fluctuating market prices for energy and capacity. Although our strategy involves executing financial hedges designed to limit our exposure to fluctuations in energy prices, a portion of the revenues that our windparks will generate are unhedged and therefore depend on market prices of energy in competitive wholesale energy markets. Market prices for both energy and capacity are volatile and depend on numerous factors outside our control including economic conditions, population growth, electrical load growth, government and regulatory policy, weather, the availability of alternate generation and transmission facilities, balance of supply and demand, seasonality, transmission and transportation constraints and the price of natural gas and alternative fuels or energy sources. The wholesale power markets are also subject to market regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC and independent system operators, or ISOs, or regional transmission operators, or RTOs, which can impact market prices for energy and capacity sold in such markets, including by imposing price caps, mechanisms to address price volatility or illiquidity in the markets or system instability and market power mitigation measures. We cannot assure you that market prices will be at levels that enable us to operate profitably or as anticipated. A decline in electricity or capacity market prices below anticipated levels could have a material adverse impact on our revenues or results of operations. In markets where our windparks qualify to receive capacity payments, it is typical that only a portion of the windpark's capacity is eligible to receive capacity payments. This portion is typically based on the previous year's average net capacity factor during peak periods. In addition, changes to regulatory policy or market rules regarding the qualification of wind generation as a capacity resource could limit or eliminate each of our windparks' ability to receive payments for its generating capacity. 23 The price at which we can sell RECs is subject to change, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. Although we have agreed to sell some of our RECs at fixed prices under existing agreements with NYSERDA, portions of the RECs we expect our windparks to generate are not yet or will never be under contract and will be subject to the availability of contracts and changes in market prices. Additionally, under the terms of our contracts with NYSERDA, our ability to sell RECs to NYSERDA from our Altona, Bellmont and Chateguay windparks could be terminated if those windparks are not in operation by November 2008. Any increases in the market supply of RECs or changes in state and federal regulatory policy may decrease our ability to sell RECs in the volumes we forecast or could reduce the sales price of our RECs. Our hedging strategy may not adequately minimize market risk, may expose us to significant losses and may limit our ability to benefit from higher electricity prices. We use and plan to continue using derivative financial instruments, such as our hedging agreement with Credit Suisse Energy LLC, or Credit Suisse, an affiliate of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, to manage market risks and reduce our exposure to fluctuating electricity prices. These activities expose us to certain market risks, including unsuccessful matching of exposures or execution of our hedging strategy, and limit our ability to realize the full benefits of increases in energy prices. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in controlling risk within prescribed boundaries or limits as expected. In addition, future changes in markets may not be consistent with our historical data or assumptions. If we are not able to successfully anticipate and hedge against market risks, volatile electricity prices may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The majority of our current indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations. Our interest rate hedging policy may be insufficient to cover the risk of these fluctuations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. The majority of our current indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, typically based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. We manage interest rate fluctuation risk on our project financing debt by entering into long-term interest rate swaps, which, at December 31, 2007, had a notional value of $229.1 million. We cannot assure you that our interest rate hedging policy will be effective against future interest rate fluctuations, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. If operating costs exceed those projected for any windpark, the cash flow available from that windpark will be adversely affected, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our windparks are exposed to numerous operational risks including the impact of force majeure events, turbine breakdowns, electricity network and other utility service failures and other unanticipated events. The cost of repairing or replacing damaged equipment may be considerable, while repeated or prolonged interruption may result in termination of contracts, substantial litigation and damages or penalties for regulatory or contractual non-compliance, reduced cash flows and increased financing costs. Moreover, these amounts may not be recoverable under insurance policies or contractual claims and, in relation to network failures, network service providers and market operators may also benefit from limitations on liability, which would reduce any recovery of damages from them. In addition, our wind turbines and associated equipment also require routine maintenance in order to continue to function properly. We only recently commenced operation of our first windparks and if the level of maintenance and capital expenditure exceeds our projected or contracted level, the cash flow available from the projects will be reduced, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 24 Spare parts for wind turbines and key pieces of electrical equipment may be unavailable to us. We may be unable to obtain spare parts for our wind turbines. The sources for two significant spare parts for wind turbines, namely gear boxes and blades, are located outside of North America. If we were to experience a serial failure of either spare part we would incur delays in waiting for shipment of these items to delivery ports in the U.S. In addition, we do not carry spare substation main transformers. These transformers are designed specifically for each windpark, and the current lead time to order this equipment is approximately one year. If we have to replace any of our transformers, we would be unable to sell electricity from the affected windpark for over a year. Our windparks' use and enjoyment of real property rights obtained from third parties may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and superior leaseholders of the grantors of these real property rights. Each of our windparks will be located on land occupied pursuant to various easements and leases. Our rights pursuant to these easements and leases allow us to install wind turbines and related equipment and transmission lines for the windpark and to operate the windpark. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements and leases may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement and lease rights of third parties (such as leases of oil, gas, coal or other mineral rights) that were created prior to our easements and leases. As a result, our rights under these easements or leases are subject and subordinate to the rights of such third parties. A default by a landowner at one or more of our windparks under a mortgage could result in a foreclosure on the landowner's property and thereby terminate our easements and leases required to operate the windpark. Similarly, it is possible that another type of lienholder, such as a government authority having a tax lien, could foreclose upon a parcel and take ownership and possession of the portion of the windpark located on the parcel. In addition, the rights of a third party pursuant to a superior lease could result in damage to or disturbance of the equipment at a windpark, or require relocation of windpark assets. If any of our windparks were to suffer the loss of all or a portion of its wind turbines or related equipment as a result of a foreclosure by a mortgagee or other lienholder of a land parcel, or damage arising from the conduct of superior leaseholders, our operations and revenues may be adversely affected. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses we may incur as a result of the construction and operation of our windparks. We are exposed to risks inherent in the construction and operation of windparks, such as natural disasters, breakdowns and manufacturing defects that could harm persons and damage property. We have obtained insurance coverage for the principal risks of our business. However, we cannot assure you that our insurance policies are or will be sufficient to cover possible losses resulting from natural disasters, breakdowns or manufacturing defects. If we were to sustain a serious uninsured loss or a loss exceeding the limits of our insurance policies, the resulting costs could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance policies provide for our premiums to be adjusted annually. If the premiums we pay for the policies covering our windparks increase significantly, we may be unable to maintain the same level of coverage we currently carry, or we will incur significantly greater costs to enjoy the same level of coverage, including through higher deductibles. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 25 We will be required to dismantle wind turbines and other components when a windpark ceases operations. In certain jurisdictions in which we plan to develop windparks, we may be under a legal or contractual obligation to dismantle our windparks and restore the site when we cease operation. In the case of our Bliss, Clinton and Ellenburg windparks, we have entered into agreements with each of the towns in which the windparks are located. Under the terms of these agreements, the towns may require us to dismantle the windparks if we violate local laws that apply to the windparks. Prior to commencing operations at the Bliss, Clinton and Ellenburg windparks, we posted security in an amount equal to the estimated cost of dismantling the wind turbines and restoring the related land, including the removal of access roads and the seeding and revegetating of the land. The amounts are subject to annual adjustment by the towns. We expect to enter into similar agreements for future windparks that we develop. If the costs to dismantle a windpark and restore the related land exceed the amount that we project, including the annual adjustments that are required under the Bliss, Clinton and Ellenburg agreements, it could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to certain risks in relation to our operating model and information technology and systems. We rely upon certain technologies and systems for the operation of our businesses. Our operations depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems that remotely control our operating and maintenance activities. A failure of our network or data gathering procedures, data viruses or attacks by computer "hackers" or other technological problems at our National Operations Center in Plattsburgh, New York, could impede the processing of data, delivery of services and the day-to-day management of our business and could result in disruptions in our operations. In addition, any failure by our information technology systems to connect our National Operations Center to the local control and information systems at each windpark may result in one or more windparks not being operated at optimal efficiency levels or at all until we become aware of a failure, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval, licenses and permits for the development, construction and operation of our windparks is critical to our future success. Each of our windparks must comply with numerous federal, regional, state and local regulations in the course of development, construction and operation. The process of obtaining and maintaining authorization for the development, construction and operation of a windpark is complicated. The authorization process involves a number of state and local governments and agencies, each responsible for evaluating the project, including by means of an environmental impact assessment. Local governments issue the relevant approvals, licenses and permits, including development and operation concessions and building permits. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the approvals, licenses and permits required to develop, construct and operate windparks that are under development or that we may develop in the future. We may also be unable to maintain the approvals, licenses and permits necessary to continue operating our windparks. If we fail to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals, licenses or permits, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Public opposition toward windparks may make it more difficult for us to obtain the necessary permits and authorizations required to develop or maintain a windpark. Public attitude towards the aesthetic and environmental impacts of wind energy projects impacts our ability to develop our windparks. In many states and localities, the environmental impact review process ensures a role for concerned members of the public that can lead to changes in design or 26 layout, extensive impact mitigation requirements, or even the rejection of a project. In some of the regions where we are developing or plan to develop windparks, local acceptance is critical to our ability to obtain and maintain necessary permits and approvals. We can provide no assurance that any of our projects under development will be accepted by the affected population. Public opposition can also lead to legal challenges that may result in the invalidation of a permit or, in certain cases, the dismantling of an existing windpark as well as increased cost and delays. Reduced acceptance of windparks by local populations, an increase in the number of legal challenges or an unfavorable trend in the outcome of these challenges could prevent us from achieving our development plans, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our costs of regulatory compliance are significant and any non-compliance with, or changes in, applicable laws or regulations may result in liabilities or increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our legal and regulatory compliance costs and obligations in connection with the development, construction and operation of our windparks are substantial. For example, some of the environmental permits and governmental approvals that have been issued for our projects contain conditions and restrictions, including restrictions or limits on the disturbance of wetlands, the disruption of wildlife and noise impacts. We expect the permits issued in the future for our projects in development will contain similar requirements. If we fail to comply with these restrictions, or with any other regulatory standards, we may become subject to regulatory enforcement actions and the operation of our windparks could subject us to fines, penalties, additional costs or the inability to renew, maintain or obtain all required environmental permits and governmental approvals. Any decision by the governmental authorities to deny the issuance of or revoke permits or approvals, or our inability to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance costs, the need for additional capital expenditures, a suspension of our windpark operations and development or a default under certain material contracts or our project financing agreements, which could have a have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our financial performance may be adversely affected by changes in the energy laws and regulations that apply to our windparks. We are subject to numerous federal and state energy laws and regulations, including without limitation, the Federal Power Act, or FPA, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, or PUHCA, and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, or PURPA. Changes in applicable energy laws or regulations, or in the interpretations of these laws and regulations, could result in increased compliance costs or the need for additional capital expenditures. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could also be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of fines. Federal and state energy policies, law and regulation supporting the creation of wholesale energy markets is currently, and may continue to be, subject to challenges, modifications and restructuring proposals, which may result in limitations on the commercial strategies available to us for the sale of our power. Under the FPA, FERC regulates wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by "public utilities" as defined under the FPA and places constraints on the conduct of their business, including, among other things, rate and corporate regulation. In addition, we are subject to regulation by state agencies with respect to the operation of our windparks. In order for each of our windparks to make wholesale sales of electric energy and capacity at negotiated or market rates, it needs the authorization of FERC. Wholesale sellers authorized by FERC to sell at market-based rates may obtain waivers or blanket pre-approvals as to certain of the regulatory 27 requirements of the FPA, including waiver of FERC's accounting regulations and blanket pre-authorization to issue securities and assume liabilities. If certain conditions are not met, FERC has the authority to revoke or revise market-based rate authority and require sales to be made based on cost of service rates. While each of the Initial New York Windparks and certain of our other windparks have obtained such market-based rate authorization from FERC, there is no guarantee that regulatory or other changes will not result in limitation or the loss of such authorization or prevent our other windparks from obtaining such authorization. A loss of our market-based rate authority could have a materially negative impact on our business. Even where market-based rate authority has been granted, FERC may impose various forms of market mitigation measures, including price caps, bidding rules and operating restrictions, where it determines that potential market power might exist and that the public interest requires such potential market power to be mitigated. In addition, PUHCA provides, in relevant part, that any entity that owns, controls or holds power to vote 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a "public utility company" (which is defined to include an "electric utility company") or a company that is a "holding company" of a public utility company or public utility holding company, is subject to certain regulations granting the FERC access to books and records and oversight over certain affiliate transactions. State regulatory commissions may in some instances also have access to books and records of holding companies. Entities that are holding companies solely by virtue of their ownership of qualifying facilities, or QFs, and exempt wholesale generators, or EWGs, are exempt from FERC access to books and records under PUHCA. In order to obtain EWG status pursuant to PUHCA, the owner of a generating facility must demonstrate that it is engaged directly, or indirectly through one or more affiliates, and exclusively in the business of owning and/or operating facilities used exclusively for the generation of electricity for sale at wholesale. In order to obtain QF status pursuant to PURPA, a generating facility must qualify as a small power production facility or cogeneration facility that has either filed a self-certification of QF status with, or has received a QF certification order from, FERC. A wind generation facility may qualify as small power production facility QF if it is less than 80 MW. We have received QF status designation from FERC for our Texas windparks. While each of the Initial New York Windparks has filed a self-certification with the FERC that it is an EWG, there is no guarantee that regulatory or other changes will not result in the loss of such EWG status or prevent our other windparks from obtaining such status, in which case we may become subject to regulation under PUHCA. We also face regulatory risk imposed by various transmission providers and operators, including RTOs and ISOs, and their corresponding market rules. Transmission providers have FERC-approved tariffs that govern access to their transmission systems. These tariffs may contain provisions that limit access to the transmission grid or allocate scarce transmission capacity in a particular manner. To conduct our business, we must obtain licenses, permits and approvals for our windparks. These licenses, permits and approvals can be in addition to any required environmental permits. No assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain and comply with all necessary licenses, permits and approvals for our windparks. If we cannot comply with all applicable regulations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We cannot predict whether federal or state governmental entities or regulatory authorities will adopt new laws or regulations, or modify existing ones, affecting the electric power industry in general, or our windparks in particular, and we cannot provide assurance that the introductions of new laws and regulations, or other future regulatory developments, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Regulatory changes in a jurisdiction where we are developing a project may make the continued development of the project infeasible or economically disadvantageous and any expenditures we have made to date on such project may be wholly or partially written off. Any of these changes could significantly increase the regulatory-related compliance and other expenses incurred by the projects and could significantly reduce or entirely eliminate any potential revenues that can be generated by one or more of the projects, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 28 As a result of our operating as a public company, our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives, which may divert management's attention from the growth and operation of our business. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market impose a number of requirements on public companies, including provisions regarding corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantial additional costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we will need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Risks Relating to this Offering Conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our sponsors. Immediately following this offering, the sponsors will hold, in the aggregate, % of our common stock ( % if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). Because of these holdings, the sponsors (subject to regulatory approval in the case of CPPIB) will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions, and they will have significant control over our management and policies. The directors elected by the sponsors will also be able to control decisions affecting our capital structure. In addition, we intend to avail ourselves of the "controlled company" exception under The NASDAQ Stock Market rules, which eliminates the requirement that we have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and that we have compensation and nominating committees composed entirely of independent directors, but retains the requirement that we have an audit committee composed entirely of independent directors. Our governance agreements will provide that, initially, persons designated by JPMP and, subject to regulatory approval, persons designated by CPPIB will serve on our board of directors following the completion of this offering. JPMP shall have the right to designate additional persons to serve on our board of directors as additional independent directors are added to our board of directors so long as JPMP maintains certain ownership levels and we continue to be permitted to avail ourselves of the "controlled company" exception permitted under The NASDAQ Stock Market rules. Additionally, our governance agreements 29 provide that directors shall be elected by a plurality of votes and do not provide for cumulative voting rights. Because of the significant common stock ownership of the sponsors, and because our board of directors will be divided into three staggered classes, the sponsors may be able to influence or control our affairs and policies even after they cease to have a right to designate a majority of the non-disinterested directors. The directors elected by the sponsors will have the authority, subject to the terms of our debt, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends, pay advisory fees and make other decisions, and they may have an interest in our doing so. The sponsors and their affiliates may invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us or companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts between the interests of either of the sponsors and the interests of our other stockholders arise, the sponsor-designated directors may have conflicts of interest. Although our directors and officers will have a duty of loyalty to us under Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation that will be adopted in connection with this offering, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible, if done in compliance with Delaware law and our governance agreements. The actions of our controlling stockholders may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest. There has been no prior market for our common stock and an active trading market may not develop. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. An active trading market may not develop following the closing of this offering or, if developed, may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares of common stock at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the market value and increase the volatility of your shares of common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration. The price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and your investment may decline in value. The initial public offering price for the shares of our common stock to be sold in this offering was determined by negotiation between the representatives of the underwriters and us. This price may not reflect the market price of our common stock following this offering. In addition, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;  failure to meet our earnings estimates;  failure to develop and construct planned windparks on time and on budget;  conditions and trends in the energy, capacity and REC markets in which we operate and changes in the estimation of the size and growth rate of these markets;  availability of equipment, labor and other items required for the development and construction of a windpark;  changes or proposed changes in, or differing interpretations of, laws or regulations affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;  additions or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel; 30  announcements of significant contracts or development by us or our competitors;  loss of one or more of our significant revenue sources;  changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;  the trading volume of our common stock; and  general market and economic conditions. In addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market, as well as the market for broader energy and renewable energy companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected. These broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our management team may invest or spend the net proceeds of this offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways that may not yield a positive return. Presently, we anticipate using the net proceeds to us from this offering for general corporate purposes, including funding the costs of our corporate, operating and project development activities, the investment of equity into project companies and the funding of other capital expenditures, including under turbine supply agreements. Accordingly, our management will have considerable discretion in the application of these proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity to assess whether these proceeds are being used appropriately. These proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. Until the net proceeds are used, we will invest them in investment grade, short-term interest bearing marketable securities. Future sales of our common stock may depress our share price. After this offering, we will have shares of common stock outstanding. The shares sold in this offering (or shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from us in full) will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under federal securities laws unless purchased by our affiliates. The remaining shares of common stock outstanding after this offering are subject to lock-up agreements, will be available for sale in the public market beginning 180 days after the date of this prospectus, and will be subject to certain volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The representatives of the underwriters may waive the lock-up provisions in their sole discretion. In addition, the sponsors and other significant stockholders will have certain demand and "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to the common stock that they will retain following this offering. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market following this offering, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. This offering will cause substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of your shares of common stock. If you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you will experience immediate dilution of $ per share based on the mid-point of the range on the cover page of this prospectus because the price that you pay will be substantially greater than the adjusted pro forma net tangible book value per share of common stock that you acquire. This dilution is due in large part to the fact 31 that our sponsors and certain members of management paid substantially less per share of common stock (after giving effect to the conversion of their equity interests into our common stock at the consummation of this offering) than the price per share to the public in this offering. If outstanding options to purchase our common stock are exercised, you will experience additional dilution. See the section entitled "Dilution" in this prospectus for a more detailed description of this dilution. Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent acquisition of us, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders. These provisions include:  a classified board of directors;  limitations on the removal of directors;  the power of the board of directors or the sponsors, in the case of a vacancy of a sponsor board designee, to fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;  the ability of our board of directors to designate one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval;  the inability of stockholders to fix the number of directors;  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent if less than a majority of our outstanding common stock is owned by the sponsors; and  the inability of stockholders to call special meetings. Our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to shares of preferred stock, par value $ per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. Although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. 32 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the statements made in this prospectus are forward-looking statements. These forward looking statements are based upon our current expectations and projections about future events. When used in this prospectus, the words "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "expect," "should," "may" and similar expressions, or the negative of such words and expressions, are intended to identify forward- looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words or expressions. The forward-looking statements in this prospectus are primarily located in the material set forth under the headings "Prospectus Summary," "Risk Factors," "Capitalization," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business," but are found in other locations as well. These forward-looking statements generally relate to our plans, objectives and expectations for future operations and are based upon management's current estimates and projections of future results or trends. Although we believe that our plans and objectives reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we may not achieve these plans or objectives. You should read this prospectus completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We will not update forward-looking statements even though our situation may change in the future. Specific factors that might cause actual results to differ from our expectations or may affect the value of our common stock include, but are not limited to:  significant considerations and risks discussed in this prospectus;  operating risks and the amounts and timing of revenues and expenses;  interruptions or failures in the transmission networks that we use;  delays, cancellations or cost overruns involving the development or construction of our windparks;  financial market conditions and the results of financing efforts;  our dependence on federal tax benefits and state regulatory benefits for renewable energy generation, which may expire or may be modified in a manner that reduces available benefits;  political, legal, regulatory, governmental, administrative and economic conditions and developments in the U.S.;  environmental constraints on operations and environmental liabilities arising out of past or present operations;  the effectiveness of our commodity hedges and the creditworthiness of our commodity hedge counterparties;  the vulnerability of our windparks to adverse meteorological and atmospheric conditions;  the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory proceedings and changes, including legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry and incentives for the production of renewable energy, changes in environmental and other laws and regulations to which we are subject, as well as changes in the application of existing laws and regulations;  current and future litigation;  competition from other similar renewable energy projects, including any such new renewable energy projects developed in the future, and from alternative electricity producing technologies;  the effect of and changes in economic conditions in the areas in which we operate; 33  market or business conditions and fluctuations in demand for and price of energy, capacity or RECs in the markets in which we operate; and  the direct or indirect impact on our business resulting from terrorist incidents or responses to such incidents, including the effect on the availability of and premiums on insurance. INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus concerning the wind energy industry and our general expectations concerning this industry are based on information from independent industry analysts and publications and management estimates. We have derived management estimates from publicly available information as well as data from our internal research. None of the independent industry publications used in this prospectus was prepared on our or our affiliates' behalf. Estimates of historical growth rates in the markets in which we operate are not necessarily indicative of future growth rates in such markets. We have included a glossary of selected industry terms on page 147. CORPORATE REORGANIZATION We are currently a Delaware limited liability company. In connection with this offering, we will convert into a Delaware corporation. This conversion has been authorized by our board of managers pursuant to the authority granted to them in our operating agreement, without any further action, including any vote or consent, required or anticipated on the part of our existing preferred or common unitholders. Upon the effectiveness of our corporate reorganization, each outstanding preferred unit and common unit will be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to the cash proceeds that are assumed to be received by such preferred or common unitholders in a distribution according to the relative rights and preferences as set forth in the operating agreement divided by an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Our corporate reorganization will be effective prior to the completion of this offering. After the conversion but prior to the completion of this offering, our preferred unitholders will hold % of our outstanding common stock and our common unitholders will hold % of our outstanding common stock. 34 USE OF PROCEEDS Based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share (the mid-point of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus), we estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs of approximately $ million payable by us, will be approximately $ million (or $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in full). We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including funding the costs of our corporate, operating and project development activities, the investment of equity into project companies and the funding of other capital expenditures, including under turbine supply agreements. The amount and timing of these expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the federal, state and local permitting process, the construction schedule of our projects and contractors, the delivery of goods and equipment by our suppliers and various other considerations typically associated with large-scale construction projects. Pending their use, we will invest the net proceeds of the offering in investment grade, short-term, interest-bearing, marketable securities. A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ would increase or decrease net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $ million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering. Each increase of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 increase in the assumed public offering price of $ per share, would increase the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $ million. Similarly, each decrease of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 decrease in the assumed public offering price of $ per share, would decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $ million. We do not expect that a change in the offering price or the number of shares by these amounts would have a material effect on our use of proceeds from this offering. 35 DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid dividends on shares of our common stock or made cash distributions in respect of our common and preferred units. We expect to retain any future earnings to finance the development and growth of our business. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our future decisions regarding the payment of dividends on shares of our common stock will depend on our results of operations, our financial condition and our development plans, as well as any other factors that our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may consider relevant. In addition, the terms of our existing indebtedness restrict, and our future indebtedness may restrict, our ability to pay dividends. 36 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and our consolidated capitalization as of December 31, 2007:  on an actual basis;  on a pro forma basis to reflect our corporate reorganization, including the filing of our certificate of incorporation to authorize shares of common stock and shares of undesignated preferred stock and the automatic conversion of all our outstanding preferred and common units into shares of common stock as described under "Corporate Reorganization"; and  on a pro forma as adjusted basis to reflect the sale by us of shares of common stock in this offering at an assumed initial offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the range on the cover of this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses. You should read this table in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Use of Proceeds" included elsewhere in this prospectus. As of December 31, 2007 Actual Pro Forma Pro Forma As Adjusted(1) (in thousands) Total debt $ 899,070 $ $ Members'/stockholders' equity: Preferred units, 3,024,761 issued and outstanding, actual; no preferred units issued and outstanding, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted 302,476 Common units, 46,326 issued and outstanding, actual; no common units issued and outstanding, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted 46 Undesignated preferred stock, $ par value, no shares authorized, issued and outstanding, actual; shares authorized, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted; no shares issued and outstanding for all periods presented  Common stock, $0.01 par value, no shares authorized, issued and outstanding, actual; shares authorized, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted; and shares issued and outstanding, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted, respectively  Additional paid-in capital  Accumulated deficit (72,009 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (5,737 ) Total members'/stockholders' equity 224,776 Total capitalization $ 1,123,846 $ $ (1) Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed public offering price of $ per share would increase (decrease) each of additional paid-in capital, total stockholders' equity and total capitalization by approximately $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as 37 set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering. Each increase of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 increase in the assumed offering price of $ per share, would increase each of additional paid-in capital, total stockholders' equity and total capitalization by approximately $ million. Similarly, each decrease of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 decrease in the assumed offering price of $ per share, would decrease each of additional paid-in capital, total stockholders' equity and total capitalization by approximately $ million. The as adjusted information discussed above is illustrative only and will adjust based on the actual public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. 38 DILUTION If you invest in our common stock in this offering, you will experience dilution to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share you pay in this offering and the pro forma net tangible book value or deficit per share of our common stock after this offering. Net tangible book value per share is determined at any date by subtracting our total liabilities from the total book value of our tangible assets and dividing the difference by the number of shares of common stock deemed to be outstanding at that date. Our pro forma net tangible book value as of December 31, 2007, was $ million, or $ per share, based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2007 after giving effect to our corporate reorganization. After giving effect to the sale of common stock offered in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31, 2007 would have been approximately $ million, or approximately $ per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value of $ per share to existing stockholders, and an immediate dilution of $ per share to investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering. The following table illustrates this substantial and immediate per share dilution to new investors: Assumed initial public offering price per share $ Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of December 31, 2007 $ Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share to existing stockholders attributable to investors in this offering Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering Pro forma dilution per share to new investors $ Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed public offering price of $ per share would increase or decrease our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value by approximately $ million, or approximately $ per share, and the pro forma dilution per share to investors in this offering by approximately $ per share, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering. An increase of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 increase in the assumed offering price of $ per share, would result in a pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value of approximately $ million, or $ per share, and the pro forma dilution per share to investors in this offering would be $ per share. Similarly, a decrease of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares offered by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 decrease in the assumed public offering price of $ per share, would result in an pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value of approximately $ million, or $ per share, and the pro forma dilution per share to investors in this offering would be $ per share. The pro forma as adjusted information discussed above is illustrative only and will adjust based on the actual public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in this offering, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering would be $ per share, the increase in the pro forma net tangible book value per share to existing 39 stockholders would be $ per share and the pro forma dilution to new investors purchasing common stock in this offering would be $ per share. Differences Between New and Existing Investors in Number of Shares and Amount Paid The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2007, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to our corporate reorganization the differences between the number of shares of common stock purchased from us, the total consideration and the weighted average price per share paid by existing stockholders and by investors participating in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses: Shares purchased Total consideration Average price per share Number Percent Amount Percent Existing stockholders % $ % $ Investors in the offering % $ % $ Total 100 % $ 100 % $ The number of shares of common stock outstanding in the table above is based on the pro forma number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and assumes no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, the number of shares of common stock held by existing stockholders will be reduced to % of the total number of shares of common stock to be outstanding after this offering, and the number of shares of common stock held by investors participating in this offering will be increased to shares or % of the total number of shares of common stock to be outstanding after this offering. As of December 31, 2007, there were no options or warrants to purchase common stock outstanding. Effective upon the closing of this offering, an aggregate of shares of our common stock will be reserved for future issuance under our benefit plans. To the extent that any of these options are exercised, new options are issued under our benefit plans or we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, there will be further dilution to investors participating in this offering. 40 SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA The following table sets forth our selected consolidated financial data for the periods ended and at the dates indicated in such table.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, statements regarding the industry outlook, our expectations regarding the future performance of our business, and the other non-historical statements contained herein are forward-looking statements. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." You should also review the "Risk Factors" section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements. Overview We are a rapidly growing wind energy company operating 282 MW of electrical generating capacity with more than 950 MW of additional capacity that we expect to commence operations during 2008 and 2009. We are focused on developing, financing, constructing, owning and operating windparks in attractive energy markets in the United States. Our strategy is to grow our fully integrated business principally through organic development in regions with deregulated energy markets, acceptable wind resources and favorable legislative and economic incentives such as RPS programs and active REC markets. Recent Developments In March 2008, we commenced operation of our Bliss and Ellenburg windparks. In April 2008, we commenced operation of our Clinton windpark. All three of these windparks are located in New York, and we refer to them as our Initial New York Windparks. We expect that these windparks will collectively provide 282 MW of capacity. We will sell the energy generated by, and capacity of, these windparks to the New York Independent System Operator, or NYISO, the entity that oversees the wholesale electricity markets in the state of New York. In order to limit our exposure to volatility in NYISO energy trading prices, we have entered into a hedging arrangement with Credit Suisse with respect to a substantial portion of the energy we generate at these windparks. We have also agreed to sell the majority of the RECs generated through the operation of these windparks to New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA, the entity that administers the central procurement of RECs for the State of New York. On April 8, 2008 we entered into a mandate letter with a group of financial institutions, under which the financial institutions agreed to provide construction and term loans, letter of credit facilities and tax equity financing for our Great Plains I windpark that is currently in construction in Texas. The financial institutions' commitment under the mandate letter is subject to the completion of definitive agreements and customary conditions precedent. In connection with our continual assessment of our capital and resource allocation, we determined that it was strategically appropriate to sell two windparks that were in development in Michigan. On February 29, 2008, our subsidiary, Noble Thumb Windpark, LLC, entered into an agreement with Babcock & Brown Renewable Holdings Inc. for the sale of the wind power development assets associated with our projects in Huron and Sanilac Counties, Michigan as well as 46 wind turbines intended for use in the Huron County project. The sale price is approximately $85.1 million and we have scheduled a tentative closing in May 2008. The sale price is subject to certain adjustments; however, we believe that the sale price, less selling expenses, will exceed the carrying amount of the assets group held for sale. Accordingly, we do not expect to recognize a loss in connection with this transaction. 43 Revenues We expect to generate revenues from the sale of energy and capacity from our operating windparks as well as from the sale of RECs attributable to such operations. Our revenues from the Initial New York Windparks will consist of:  Sale of Energy. We will sell the energy that we produce at the Initial New York Windparks into NYISO at the market clearing price on an hourly basis. The market clearing price will be determined by supply and demand in the NYISO market at any given time at the point of sale and is largely tied to the marginal cost of production of the conventional power generators.  Sale of RECs. We have agreed to sell the majority of the RECs we expect to generate at our Initial New York Windparks to NYSERDA pursuant to executed standard form long-term, fixed-price contracts. One REC is created for each MWh of energy we produce. However, the total amount of RECs we can sell under the NYSERDA contracts with respect to all three Initial New York Windparks is limited to 850,000 per contract year. Consequently, to the extent that we create an amount of RECs that exceed that number in any contract year, we intend to sell the excess RECs on the open market.  Sale of Capacity. We expect to receive monthly payments for the installed capacity, or ICAP, at our Initial New York Windparks. These payments will be determined by a formula based on a fixed percentage of the ICAP of the Initial New York Windparks multiplied by a fluctuating price, referred to as the ICAP price. We have not yet entered into any agreements for the sale of ICAP, however, we may sell the ICAP either directly to NYISO or to third-party market participants. Prices for the sale of the ICAP will be made at auction clearing prices if sold through NYISO, or at negotiated market prices at the time of any sale if sold to third-party market participants. In markets where our windparks qualify to receive capacity payments, generally only a portion of the windpark's capacity is eligible to receive capacity payments. This portion is typically based on the previous year's average net capacity factor during peak periods. In order to limit our exposure to price volatility in the NYISO energy market, our subsidiary, Noble Environmental Power 2006 Hold Co, LLC, or NEP NY 2006, entered into a ten-year energy hedging arrangement with Credit Suisse. Under this financial fixed-for-float energy swap arrangement:  we pay Credit Suisse a monthly amount equal to the product of (i) the prevailing market price for energy that we sell in that month, and (ii) the actual amount of energy that we generated during such month up to a specified cap; and  Credit Suisse pays us a monthly amount equal to the product of (i) a specified fixed price, and (ii) the actual amount of energy that we generated during such month up to the same specified cap. Pursuant to this agreement, we have implemented a tracking account that tracks, on a monthly basis, the difference between our energy production from the Initial New York Windparks and a predetermined notional volume under the swap for that month. Our monthly net settlement payments with Credit Suisse may be more or less than would otherwise be due based on the notional volume of the swap. This tracking account was incorporated into the hedge in order to allow us to manage our risk associated with the inherent volatility associated with the volume of energy production from our windparks. In addition, (i) in certain circumstances where our energy production levels and the price of energy sold into the NYISO generate excess cash flow, we are required to make cash payments to Credit Suisse in addition to those described above, which are credited in our favor in the tracking account, and (ii) in certain circumstances where our energy production levels and the price of energy sold into the NYISO are below specified amounts, and if certain thresholds are met, Credit Suisse is required to make monthly cash payments to us, which have no impact on the tracking account. The tracking account is designed to capture the net amounts, if any, of over or under-payment between the 44 parties over the life of the agreement and is settled at the end of the ten-year term of the hedging arrangement. We have the option to repay any amounts due from us to Credit Suisse over a two year period following the end of the hedging arrangement, subject to certain conditions, including the requirement that we provide additional collateral to Credit Suisse. We anticipate that in future projects we will generate revenue in a similar fashion, including from the sale of energy and RECs and, if a capacity market exists in the relevant jurisdiction, from the sale of capacity. We also expect to enter into energy hedges with respect to our future projects similar to our current energy hedge arrangement with Credit Suisse. Expenses Our principal expenses include those associated with our corporate- and project-level operations and new project development efforts. Our corporate operating expenses include salaries and wages, employee taxes and fringe benefits and general and administrative expenses, including payments for legal, accounting and other professional services. Our project-level expenses include labor costs, easement payments to our landowners, interest expenses and associated financing costs, insurance and costs to maintain permits, payments under local taxing authority agreements, payments under agreements with local governments and municipalities, the cost for spare parts for wind turbines and other turbine-maintenance expenses, and expenses for legal, engineering and other professional services. New project development expenses include expenses relating to initial project development activities, including labor costs, expenses related to our feasibility analyses and other studies, payments for legal and other professional and advisory services, and easement payments made before a project becomes financially viable and capitalized. Certain of these expenses may be capitalized depending on the stage of development of a particular windpark based on our estimates and judgments involving the completion of certain milestones. A discussion of these determinations and the capitalization of such expenses is included under the caption "Critical Accounting PoliciesCapitalization and Investment in Project Assets." During recent periods, we have seen increases in the costs relating to key aspects of our windpark development, financing, construction and operations activities. These include increases in:  the prices we must pay to landowners for access to land with attractive wind resources;  the interest rates, target yields and fees we may have to pay in connection with the debt and tax equity financing structures that we use;  the price of wind turbine generators and transportation costs;  the cost of construction due to increased labor and subcontracting costs and increases in the prices of certain construction equipment that we rely on for turbine erection; and  the amounts we must pay in order to attract and retain talented development, project financing, meteorological, construction and operations professionals. We believe that the costs for some or all of these items are likely to continue to increase in future periods and therefore could negatively impact our results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements included within this prospectus have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP. Our critical accounting 45 policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this prospectus. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. Such estimates are based on management's historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, management's observance of trends in the wind energy industry, information provided by our suppliers and counterparties and information available to management from other outside sources, as appropriate. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that involve significant judgments and the most uncertainty. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially affect our financial position and results of operations and are therefore important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Capitalization and investment in project assets. Our windparks have four basic phases: (i) development (which includes pre-development), (ii) financing and commodity risk management, (iii) engineering and construction and (iv) operation and maintenance. The development phase is further divided into pre-development and development sub-phases. During the pre-development sub-phase, milestones are created to ensure that a project is financially viable. Project viability is obtained when it becomes probable that costs incurred will generate future economic benefits sufficient to recover these costs. Examples of milestones required for a viable windpark include the following:  the identification, selection and acquisition of sufficient land for control of the land area required for a windpark;  the confirmation of a regional electricity market and the availability of RECs;  the confirmation of acceptable wind resources;  the confirmation of the potential to interconnect to the electric transmission grid;  the determination of limited environmental sensitivity; and  the confirmation of local community receptivity and limited potential for organized opposition. All project costs are expensed during the pre-development phase. Once the milestones for development are achieved, a project is moved from the pre-development phase into the development and engineering and construction phases. Costs incurred in these phases are capitalized as incurred, included within construction in progress, or CIP, and not depreciated until placed into commercial service. From our inception to date, interest expense and associated financing costs have been capitalized into our projects. At December 31, 2007, we had capitalized $105.5 million of these expenses and costs. Once a project is placed into operation, all accumulated costs will be reclassified from CIP to property and equipment, and become subject to depreciation or amortization over a 25 year estimated life. Valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets. We will periodically evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment, if and when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of property and equipment is considered impaired when its anticipated undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value. A loss is then recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. We are in the process of making a significant investment in our windparks and we will continue to make significant investments over the next several years. We will evaluate the recoverability of these 46 assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of our assets may not be recoverable. We have written off certain construction in progress. Write-offs totaled $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and $6.0 million from inception through December 31, 2007. The $0.6 million write-off in 2007 consisted primarily of internal salaries and overhead, third party engineering, other professional fees and certain material costs incurred in connection with the purchase of certain project development rights from a third party. In June 2007, in connection with our continual assessment of our capital and resource allocation, we determined the project was no longer in our economic interests, and wrote off all capitalized costs. During 2006, we recognized a charge to operations totaling $5.5 million related to previously capitalized costs incurred in connection with the development of Noble Thumb Windpark I. Such costs consisted primarily of internal salaries and overhead, third-party engineering, mobilization and transportation costs and certain transformer and substation costs. The write-off was determined to be necessary based on changes associated with the scope and interconnection of the original project. We determined that the original project should be split into multiple projects. Accordingly, certain costs incurred for the original project could no longer be utilized and were written off. However, as discussed above, in February 2008, we agreed to sell the assets associated with this project. Derivative Instruments. We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivatives to manage our interest rate and commodity exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met as discussed below. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recorded in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. SFAS 133 enables companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the exposure being hedged. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and are reclassified into income as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, at inception we prepare formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with SFAS No. 133. If it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. The application of SFAS 133 is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives, determination of the fair value of derivatives, identification of hedge relationships, assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness and election and designation of the normal purchases and sales exception. All of these judgments, depending upon their timing and effect, can have a significant impact on our consolidated operations. For cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, we estimate the future cash flows represented by the forecasted transactions, as well as evaluate the probability of occurrence and timing of such transactions. Changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could require discontinuance of hedge accounting or could affect the timing for the reclassification of gains or losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income/loss into earnings. 47 In the event the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer probable, the amount in other accumulated comprehensive income/loss is recognized in earnings and generally the hedge relationship is terminated. Gains resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining maturity of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap. Accounting for Income Taxes. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes as prescribed by the SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes." This method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax return and financial statement reporting bases of certain assets and liabilities. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)," which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations. We account for asset retirement obligations and conditional assets retirement obligations under SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," and FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Assets Retirement Obligations." SFAS 143 and FIN 47 require that a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation (which represents the cost for removal of turbines and related equipment and remediation of the land) be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The asset retirement cost is subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over a 25-year estimated useful life. Changes in the asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimates of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the asset retirement cost and asset retirement obligation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, " Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ," which expands derivative disclosure by requiring an entity to disclose: (i) an understanding of how and why an entity uses derivatives; (ii) an understanding of how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for; and (iii) transparency into the overall impact of derivatives on an entity's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after November 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is encouraged. We are currently analyzing the requirements of SFAS 161 and will adopt the standard on January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, " Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements ," which significantly changes the financial reporting relationship between a parent and non-controlling interests (i.e. minority interests). SFAS 160 requires all entities to report minority interests in subsidiaries as a separate component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the amount of net income attributable to the non-controlling interest is required to be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. Further, SFAS 160 requires that the transactions between a parent and non-controlling interests should be treated as equity. However, if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, a parent is required to recognize a gain or loss. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. SFAS 160 will be applied prospectively, except for presentation and disclosure requirements which are 48 required to be applied retrospectively. We will adopt SFAS 160 effective January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, " The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ." SFAS 159 permits, but does not require, entities to account for financial instruments at fair value. The standard does not extend to non-financial instruments. We have elected not to adopt the fair value provisions of SFAS 159. In September 2006, the FASB, issued SFAS No. 157, " Fair Value Measurements ," which establishes a framework for identifying and measuring fair value and is required to be implemented in the first quarter of 2008. SFAS 157 provides a fair value hierarchy, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and is expected to be applied to fair value measurements of derivative contracts that are subject to mark-to-market accounting and other assets and liabilities reported at fair value. In most cases, SFAS 157 is required to be implemented prospectively with adjustments to fair value reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of members' equity as of January 1, 2008. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS 157 except for non-financial assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources and those based on an entity's own assumptions. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to fair value measurement into three levels: Level 1measurements utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access. These consist primarily of listed equity securities, exchange traded derivatives and certain U.S. government treasury securities. Level 2measurements include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and other observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. These consist primarily of non-exchange traded derivatives such as swaps, forward contracts or options and most fixed income securities. Level 3measurements use unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities, are based on the best information available and might include an entity's own data. In some valuations, the inputs used may fall into different levels of the hierarchy. In these cases, the financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. These consist mainly of assets and liabilities valued through an internal modeling process. The following table presents information about our respective assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2007, including the fair value measurements and the levels 49 of inputs used in determining those fair values as we would expect to report them had we adopted SFAS 157 as of December 31, 2007.

Results of Operations Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 and the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Year Ended December 31, Period-to- Period Change 2007 2006 (in thousands) Revenues $  $   Salaries, wages, employment taxes and fringe benefits 10,627 9,788 8.6 % Write-off of construction in progress 574 5,500 (89.6 )% General and administrative expenses 8,265 4,024 105.4 % Depreciation 776 492 57.7 % New project development 3,625 2,241 61.8 % Change in fair value of derivative contract 21,073   Other expense 32 18 77.8 % Operating loss 44,972 22,063 103.8 % Interest income 2,486 1,384 79.6 % Net loss $ 42,486 $ 20,679 105.5 % Revenues. We did not generate any revenues in the years ended December 31, 2007 or 2006, as none of our windparks had yet commenced operations. Salaries, Wages, Employment Taxes and Fringe Benefits. Salary, wages, employment taxes and fringe benefits for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $10.6 million, as compared with $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which represented a $0.8 million or 8.6% increase. This increase was due to an overall increase in headcount across our business to 138 at December 31, 2007 from 91 at December 31, 2006. In addition, we hired several executives during this timeframe which further increased salary and wage expense from that of prior periods. 50 Write-off of Construction In Progress. Write-offs of construction in progress for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $0.6 million, as compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which represented a $4.9 million or 89.6% decrease. The $0.6 million write-off in 2007 related to professional, consulting and material costs incurred in connection with the purchase of certain project development rights from a third party. The $5.5 million write-off in 2006 was associated with previously capitalized costs incurred in the development of Noble Thumb Wind Park I. Based on changes associated with the scope and interconnection of the original project, we determined that we could no longer utilize certain costs incurred for the original project and wrote-off those costs. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $8.3 million, as compared with $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which represented a $4.3 million or 105.4% increase. This increase was due primarily to increases in professional fees (legal and accounting services) of approximately $2.3 million, and an increase in rent, utilities, recruiting, temporary personnel, public relations and other overhead expenses of approximately $2.0 million. The increase in professional fees related to non-capitalized legal costs incurred in connection with project organization, permitting and regulatory matters, and costs associated with professional advisory services and financing transactions. Additionally, professional fees included increased costs associated with our financial statement audit and tax compliance requirements. Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $0.8 million, as compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which represented a $0.3 million or 57.7% increase. The increase was due to additions to property and equipment of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. New Project Development Expenses. New project development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $3.6 million, as compared with $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which represented a $1.4 million or 61.8% increase. This increase was due to an increase in personnel and consultants associated with the expansion of our project development activities. Change in fair value of derivative contract. We entered into a ten-year fixed-for-float energy hedging arrangement with Credit Suisse in June 2007. The change in the fair value of this derivative contract for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $21.0 million. As the wind generating assets associated with this instrument were not yet generating power at December 31, 2007, and this instrument was not designated as a hedge under SFAS 133, we recorded the decrease in the fair value as a liability and a corresponding charge to operations. Interest Income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2.5 million, as compared with $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which represented a $1.1 million or 79.6% increase. This increase was due to an increase in interest earned in connection with the short-term investment of cash and restricted cash balances. Cash and restricted cash balances available for investment purposes increased to approximately $97.2 million at December 31, 2007 from $19.7 million at December 31, 2006. Interest during 2007 and 2006 was earned on our short-term investment of cash and restricted cash balances associated with capital contributions from our sponsors received during 2007 and 2006 of approximately $128.3 million and $158.5 million and proceeds from borrowings of approximately $1,015.4 million and $663.8 million, respectively. Net Loss. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $42.5 million, as compared with $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which represented a $21.8 million or 105.5% increase. This increase was attributable to the factors discussed above. 51 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2006 and the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Year Ended December 31, Period-to- Period Change 2006 2005 (in thousands) Revenues $  $   Salaries, wages, employment taxes and fringe benefits 9,788 2,919 235.3 % Write-off of construction in progress 5,500   General and administrative expenses 4,024 4,771 (15.7 )% Depreciation 492 83 492.8 % New project development 2,241 10 NM * Other expense 18   Operating loss 22,063 7,783 183.5 % Interest income 1,384 24 NM * Net loss $ 20,679 $ 7,759 166.5 % * NM = not meaningful Revenues. We did not generate any revenues in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 as none of our windparks had yet commenced operations. Salaries, Wages, Employment Taxes and Fringe Benefits. Salary, wages, employment taxes and fringe benefits for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $9.8 million, as compared with $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, which represented a $6.9 million or 235.3% increase. This increase was due to an overall increase in head count across our business to 91 at December 31, 2006 from 41 at December 31, 2005. In addition, we hired several executives during this timeframe which increased salary and wage expense from that of prior periods. Write-off of Construction in Progress. Write-offs of construction in progress for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $5.5 million are discussed above. There were no write-offs of construction in progress during the year ended December 31, 2005. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $4.0 million, as compared with $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, which represented a $0.8 million or 15.7% decrease. This decrease was due primarily to decreases in professional fees and easements costs of approximately $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, offset by increases in other overhead amounts of approximately $0.7 million. The decrease in professional fees and easement costs resulted from our capitalization during 2006 of certain costs as project construction in progress rather than the expensing of such costs as had been done during 2005. Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.5 million, as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, which represented a $0.4 million or 492.8% increase. The increase was due to additions to property and equipment of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. New Project Development Expenses. New project development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.2 million. There was no material new project development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005. The expense during 2006 was due to an increase in additional personnel and consultants and feasibility analysis expenses associated with the expansion of our project development activities. Interest Income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1.4 million. We had no material interest income during the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest during 2006 was earned 52 on our short-term investment of cash and restricted cash balances associated with capital contributions from our sponsors received during 2006 of approximately $158.5 million and proceeds from short-term borrowings of approximately $663.8 million. Net Loss. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $20.7 million, as compared with $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, which represented a $12.9 million or 166.5% increase over 2005. This increase was attributable to the factors discussed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to funding our general corporate and administrative, overhead expenses and working capital needs, our principal liquidity requirements can be separated into four general categories. These include liquidity required to:  fund the purchase of turbines for our windparks;  fund the cost of our development efforts with respect to a particular windpark;  prior to the commencement of operations at a particular windpark, fund windpark construction and refinance indebtedness associated with previously purchased turbines; and  after the commencement of operations at a particular windpark, refinance indebtedness incurred in connection with the construction of that windpark and the refinancing of turbine costs. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in property and equipment relating to the development of our windparks. We currently expect to spend approximately $4.3 billion on these items over the next three years. The primary working capital needs for an individual windpark include spare parts, operations and maintenance fees and real estate easement payments. The initial working capital needs for a windpark are included in the capital budget for completing construction and are financed with proceeds from the construction loan. We anticipate that our cash and restricted cash on hand, together with our expected cash flow from operations, borrowings under our turbine credit facilities, capital contributions from tax equity investors and current and future borrowings under project construction and term loans, will provide us with sufficient capital and liquidity to fund our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. Additional funds may be necessary sooner than we currently anticipate in the event of changes in our development schedule, increases in our development costs, unanticipated prepayments to suppliers, cost overruns or any shortfall in our estimated levels of operating cash flow, or to meet other unanticipated expenses. While we expect that we will have access to capital from institutional investors interested in investing in our tax equity financing structures and from the commercial bank lending market for project construction loans and term loans to our project companies on a limited recourse basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. See "Risk FactorsOur development plan requires substantial additional capital, and we may be unable to raise financing when needed or on acceptable terms, which could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our development plans" and "Our use of tax equity financing structures will place certain limits on our project subsidiaries' operational flexibility and our rights to the cash flow generated by the windparks." A substantial portion of our subsidiaries' assets has been pledged as security for our credit facilities. These credit facilities restrict the subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends (with certain exceptions), or make loans or advances to us. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements" for additional information on our credit facilities. Turbine Financing We fund the cash required to pay for turbines purchased under turbine supply agreements with GE with borrowings by certain of our subsidiaries under turbine credit facilities, which consist of a first 53 lien revolving turbine credit facility and a second lien turbine credit facility entered into by such subsidiaries. Together, these facilities allow us to finance between 60% and 100% of our turbine purchases with debt. Our indirect subsidiary, NEP Equipment Finance Co., LLC, is the borrower under the first lien revolving turbine credit facility, which provides for up to $460.0 million of revolving borrowings and matures in March 2010. Borrowings under this facility currently accrue interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum, with interest on outstanding borrowings ranging from 6.6% to 7.0% as of December 31, 2007. We are also required to pay a commitment fee, currently equal to 1.375%, on the undrawn portion of the facility. As of December 31, 2007, we had $230.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under this facility. Obligations under the first lien revolving turbine credit facility are secured by first priority liens on the assets of, and first priority pledges of all of the equity interests of, NEP Equipment Finance Co., LLC and each of our subsidiaries that are parties to the turbine supply agreements. Borrowings under the first lien revolving turbine credit facility are limited to the sum of (i) 80% of the contract price of the turbines we purchase that have been allocated to a qualified project, (ii) 60% of the contract price of the turbines we purchase that have not been allocated to a qualified project, (iii) all interest and fees under the facility, and (iv) 80% of the historic financing costs with respect to the turbine supply agreements in an aggregate amount not to exceed $18.2 million. To the extent that borrowings under the first lien revolving turbine credit facility exceed this amount and in certain other circumstances, we may be required to make prepayments under the first lien revolving turbine credit facility. Certain windparks identified in the first lien revolving turbine credit facility have been pre-approved as qualified projects. Further windparks need to be approved by a committee of lenders and the administrative agent (based on procedures and criteria specified in the first lien revolving turbine credit facility) in order to become qualified projects. Projects can lose their status as "qualified projects" for various reasons specified in the first lien revolving turbine credit facility, including (i) circumstances in which it is clear (based on specified procedures, which include independent third-party review by the specified engineer if the parties are unable to agree) that the particular project will not achieve completion sufficiently in advance of the expiration date for PTCs applicable to such project and (ii) circumstances in which the equity interests in the applicable owner of the applicable project have not been pledged to the lenders as required under the first lien revolving turbine credit facility. The first lien revolving turbine credit facility also requires that we maintain a minimum equity investment in NEP Equipment Finance Co., LLC, which we provide for in part through borrowings under the second lien turbine credit facility. Our subsidiary, NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC, has borrowed $260.0 million under the second lien turbine credit facility, which bears interest at a rate of 15% per annum and matures in July 2010. We may voluntarily make repayments of the second lien turbine credit facility at any time, with voluntary prepayments made prior to October 26, 2008 being subject to a make-whole premium and voluntary prepayments made thereafter not being subject to premium or penalty. We are required to make prepayments of the second lien turbine credit facility to the extent that the amount outstanding under the facility exceeds the sum of: (i) the positive difference (if any) between the aggregate contract price paid under all turbine supply agreements (subject to certain adjustments) and any amounts borrowed under the first lien revolving turbine credit facility plus (ii) $40 million. As of April 21, 2008 we were not required to make any prepayments of the amounts borrowed under the second lien turbine credit facility as those amounts were $2.4 million less than the amounts calculated pursuant to the sentence above. Obligations under the second lien turbine credit facility are secured by second priority liens on the assets that secure the first lien revolving turbine credit facility and by a first priority pledge of the membership interests in NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC, the parent company of NEP Equipment Finance Co., LLC, the borrower under the turbine credit facilities and in Noble Environmental Power 2009 Equipment Co., LLC, a party to a turbine supply agreement with GE, as well as a first priority pledge of the rights of Noble Environmental Power 2009 Equipment Co. in such 54 turbine supply agreement. The pledge with respect to Noble Environmental Power 2009 Equipment Co. will become a second priority pledge at such time as it is required to be pledged under the first lien revolving turbine credit facility. Each of the turbine credit facilities contains certain restrictive covenants that restrict the actions of the borrower as well as customary affirmative covenants and events of default. For a further discussion of the first and second lien turbine credit facilities, see "Capital Structure and Financial Resources" and "Description of Certain Financing ArrangementsSenior Secured Turbine Credit Facilities." Wind Park Development Financing During the development phase of a particular windparkthe phase during which our efforts are focused on an analysis of feasibility, acquisition of real property rights, pre-construction engineering and permitting, but prior to the commencement of constructionlenders are typically unwilling to finance our operations with debt on terms that are acceptable to us due to the relative uncertainties associated with such early-stage projects. As a result, we have historically funded cash requirements during this period through equity contributions funded or debt guaranteed by our sponsors and in the future expect to fund such cash requirements with a combination of cash flows from operations as well as the proceeds of this offering and possible future equity or debt offerings. We seek to minimize cash expenditures during the development phase for our windparks. Wind Park Construction Financing After we have advanced the development of a particular windpark to the point where we are prepared to commence construction of the windpark, we typically enter into a limited recourse project construction loan. The proceeds of a project construction loan are used to, among other things, (i) make repayments of amounts drawn on our turbine credit facilities with respect to turbines deployed in the applicable windpark, (ii) fund the cash required to complete construction and commence operations of the applicable windpark, including additional payments under our turbine supply agreements and (iii) fund the costs of the construction loan itself, including fees and interest incurred during the construction period. For a further discussion of the project financing facility that we entered into in connection with the construction of the Initial New York Windparks, see "Description of Certain Financing ArrangementsInitial New York Project Financing." At the time that we enter into a project construction loan, we also make cash equity contributions, the amount of which is dependent on the total estimated cost to construct the windpark, the amount of equity previously invested in the windpark, the predicted performance characteristics of the windpark based upon meteorological data that we have gathered and the associated revenues and expenses resulting in the final anticipated capital structure of the windpark. These cash contributions have historically been funded by our sponsors and in the future we expect to fund these cash requirements with a combination of cash flows from operations as well as the proceeds of this offering and possible future equity or debt offerings. In the case of the Initial New York Windparks, we made an initial cash equity contributions of approximately $88.5 million, and secured a project construction loan of $305.4 million, as well as an equity bridge loan of $179.6 million, for a total financing of $485.0 million. Refinancing Upon Commencement of Commercial Operations and Tax Equity Financing Once construction of a windpark is completed and commercial operations have commenced, our financing requirements with respect to that windpark will depend on the type of tax equity financing we obtain for that windpark, which we expect to generally follow one of the following two approaches:  In certain cases, when a windpark commences commercial operations, a portion of the construction loan automatically converts into a long-term loan facility, typically with a 10- to 15-year term. The remaining portion of the construction loan is then repaid using (i) the cash proceeds of equity investments in the applicable windpark by tax equity investors who make 55 contributions at the time that the applicable windpark commences operations, as well as additional fixed and contingent (based on kWhs produced) contributions over a period of time up to ten years and (ii) in some cases, additional cash equity contributions from us. We refer to this form of tax equity financing as an Additional Equity Contribution partnership, or AEC, structure. See "BusinessOrganization of Our BusinessFinancing and Commodities Risk ManagementProject FinancingTax Equity Financing."  In other cases, we expect that when a windpark commences commercial operations all of the project construction loan will be repaid at that time using (i) the cash proceeds of equity investments by tax equity investors who make their entire contribution at the time the applicable windpark commences operations, (ii) additional cash equity contributions from us, which additional cash equity contribution may be funded by a loan at the member level and (iii) possibly a term loan at the project company or project holding company level in certain circumstances. We refer to this form of tax equity financing as a pre-tax, after-tax partnership structure or PAPS, structure. See "BusinessOrganization of Our BusinessFinancing and Commodities Risk ManagementProject FinancingTax Equity Financing." We expect to fund any additional cash equity contributions required from us through a combination of a portion of the proceeds of this offering, future equity or debt offerings and expected cash flow from operations. In addition, we expect that tax equity financings of our future windparks will comply with an IRS safe harbor for wind credit investment structures. We have the intent and the ability to refinance the outstanding $485.0 million of the Initial New York Windparks' construction loan and equity bridge loan as follows:  approximately $324.7 million of the construction and equity bridge loans will be converted into a ten-year term loan facility; and  tax-equity investors will make an equity investment of approximately $220 million in NEP NY 2006, our subsidiary that owns the Initial New York Windparks. On May 7, 2008, we issued a notice of term conversion to Dexia Credit Local, New York Branch, or Dexia, and to our tax equity investors. The notice triggers the conversion of our construction loan and a portion of our equity bridge loan to a term loan, and triggers the requirement for the tax equity investors' investment in NEP NY 2006. The conversion is expected to take place within four banking days from the date of the notice. The tax equity investment will occur simultaneously with the term conversion closing. In addition, we expect that the tax equity investors in the Initial New York Windparks will contribute additional amounts at the end of each fiscal quarter based on the amounts of PTCs generated by the Initial New York Windparks. In future windparks under the AEC structure, a portion of the payments will be fixed and the remaining payments will be contingent to conform to an IRS safe harbor for wind credit investment structures. This expected stream of additional cash flows based on energy production is added to the cash available for debt service and enables us to support a larger term loan. The terms of our relationship with the tax equity investors in the Initial New York Windparks will be governed by the limited liability company agreement of NEP NY 2006. We refer to this operating agreement as the New York 2006 LLC Agreement, and we expect that this agreement will be executed prior to the completion of this offering. The New York 2006 LLC Agreement will provide that we will control the day-to-day operations of NEP NY 2006 with most material actions requiring the agreement of the tax equity investor. The New York 2006 LLC Agreement will also govern the sharing of cash flows and tax attributes between us and the tax-equity investor. As shown in the table below, the allocation of cash flows will change at two defined points in time. In general, all cash available after debt service will be distributed to us until the earlier of (i) the date our capital account in NEP NY 2006 is first reduced to zero or (ii) the date our capital account is projected to first reach zero under certain probability modeling. We refer to this date 56 as the "cash flip." After the cash flip, all cash available after debt service will be distributed to the tax-equity investor, or used to prepay the term loan, until the earlier of (i) the later of the tenth anniversary of the tax equity investor's equity capital contribution date or the date the tax equity investor achieves its target rate of return, or "flip rate," taking into account both tax attributes and cash distributions and (ii) the date the tax equity investors reach the flip rate and the term loan is repaid. We refer to this date as the "flip point." At all times until the flip point, all of the tax attributes associated with NEP NY 2006 (specifically, the PTCs and the accelerated depreciation) will be allocated to the tax equity investor. In the event the IRS were to successfully challenge these allocations based on non-binding guidance issued prior to the equity capital contribution date, or such guidance becomes binding law, and the allocations are negatively impacted, the flip point could be delayed. After the flip point, the tax equity investor will retain a small residual equity interest in the entity, with all other cash distributed to us. Cash Distributions PTCs and Depreciation (1) Noble Investor Noble Investor Year One  Cash Flip 100 % 0 % 0 % 100% (2) Cash Flip  Flip Point 0 % 100 % 0 % 100% (2) After Flip Point 95 % 5 % 95 % 5 % (1) PTCs provide the tax investor with a tax credit based on energy revenues against federal income taxes for a ten-year period following the date that the relevant wind turbine is placed in service. Most windpark assets are depreciable over a 5-year period after the commencement of operations. (2) In future windparks, PTCs and depreciation generally will be allocated 99% to the Investor and 1% to Noble over the initial 10-year period to conform to an IRS safe harbor for wind credit investment structures. Tax equity investors are willing to provide us with relatively low-cost capital because they can use the PTCs and accelerated depreciation generated by the windparks to offset their taxable income. Given our history of operating losses, and the fact that we expect such losses to continue, we cannot, and do not in the foreseeable future expect to be able to, use these tax attributes to reduce our own taxes. Historical Cash Flows Our cash flows for the periods discussed below were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Cash flows provided (used) by operating activities $ 39,921 $ (20,210 ) $ (6,036 ) Cash flows used by investing activities (617,867 ) (507,141 ) (47,206 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 618,043 532,591 54,375 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $40.0 million, as compared with net cash used by operating activities of $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in cash provided by operating activities of $60.2 million was due to a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $69.5 million and an increase in non-cash adjustments of $16.2 million offset by increases in net loss of $21.8 million and other current and noncurrent assets of $3.7 million. Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $617.9 million, as compared with $507.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in cash used by investing activities of $110.8 million resulted from increased capitalized spending of approximately 57 $86.4 million associated primarily with project development, construction and wind turbine and transportation costs. In addition, our restricted cash balances, primarily associated with collateral requirements on our outstanding letters of credit, increased by $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $618.0 million, as compared with $532.6 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $85.4 million resulted from increased borrowings (net of repayments and deferred costs) under our turbine supply and related credit facilities (approximately $116.3 million) offset by a decrease in equity contributions of approximately $30.2 million and an increase in deferred offering costs of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $20.2 million, as compared with $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This $14.2 million increase was principally attributable to the increase in net loss of approximately $12.9 million and operating cash use due to changes in assets and liabilities of approximately $7.5 million, offset by the effect of non-cash adjustments to net loss of approximately $6.2 million due mainly to the 2006 $5.5 million write-off of construction in progress. Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $507.1 million, as compared with $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This $459.9 million increase was principally attributable to the increase in capitalized spending of $366.9 million and construction material deposits for wind turbines of $80.1 million made during the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. In addition, our restricted cash balances, primarily associated with collateral requirements on our outstanding letters of credit, increased by approximately $12.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $532.6 million, as compared with $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This $478.2 million increase was principally due to increased borrowings and deferred financing costs on our turbine supply agreements and related credit facilities of approximately $333.7 million and increase in equity contributions of approximately $144.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Capital Structure and Financial Resources At December 31, 2007, our debt consisted of:  $490.1 million of borrowings under our turbine financing arrangements;  $257.1 million and $179.6 million of borrowings under the construction loan and equity bridge loan portions of our project finance loan, respectively, related to the Initial New York Windparks; and  $31.5 million in letters of credit issued under our project construction loan. 58 Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007, excluding interest and our obligations under the hedging arrangements with Credit Suisse: Payments due by period Description Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years (in thousands) Long-term debt $ 926,791 $  $ 513,866 $ 58,962 $ $353,963 Capital lease obligation      Operating lease obligations 7,584 4,313 2,966 305  Purchase obligations 1,011,250 595,528 384,579 5,028 26,115 Asset retirement obligations 10,228    10,228 Other long-term liabilities      Total $ 1,955,853 $ 599,841 $ 901,411 $ 64,295 $ 390,306 The above schedule excludes certain of our long-term commitments that are not quantifiable until paid. Such commitments include payments to be made under our easement contracts, interest under variable rate arrangements and distributions to our tax equity investors. This table also does not include the payments that we will make to Credit Suisse under our financial energy hedging agreement. See "Revenues." In accordance with SFAS 6, " Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to be Refinanced ," we have classified amounts due under the construction and equity bridge loans as long-term debt at December 31, 2007. Such classification is deemed appropriate as we have both the intent and ability to refinance these obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business, that have or are reasonable likely to have a material current effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks from changes in energy prices and interest rates, which may affect our results of operations and financial condition, and consequently our fair value. Changes in Energy Prices Although our strategy involves executing financial hedges designed to limit our exposure to fluctuations in electricity prices, a portion of the revenues that our windparks generate are unhedged and therefore depend on market prices of electricity. Market prices for both electricity and capacity are volatile and depend on numerous factors including economic conditions, population growth, electrical load growth, government policy, weather, the availability of alternate generation and transmission facilities and the price of natural gas and alternative fuels or energy sources. We cannot assure you that market prices will be at levels that enable us to operate profitably or as anticipated. We have entered into a financial energy hedging agreement for our Initial New York Windparks which will limit our exposure to volatility in energy prices for approximately 80% of the expected annual production of these facilities during the first ten years of their operation. Because we have not entered into any hedges for the initial New York Windparks beyond the first ten years of operation, and have not executed any hedges for any of our other windparks, a decline in energy market prices below 59 anticipated levels could have a material adverse impact on our revenues or results of operations, and could restrict or eliminate our ability to develop, finance, and complete planned windparks for which hedging transaction have not yet been executed. Because we have not executed contracts to sell the capacity of any of our windparks, a decline in capacity market prices below anticipated levels could have a material adverse impact on our revenues. Although we have agreed to sell approximately 95% of the RECs we anticipate generating from our Initial New York Windparks and our windparks in New York that are expected to commence operations in 2008 under executed ten-year fixed price contracts, a small portion of the RECs we expect our Initial New York Windparks to generate, and all of the RECs that our other windparks are expected to generate are not currently under contract and will be subject to the availability of contracts and changes in market prices. Any increases in the market supply of RECs, a decrease in the market price of RECs or changes in state and federal regulatory policy may decrease our ability to sell RECs in the volumes we forecast or could reduce the sales price of our RECs, which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues. We use and plan to continue using derivative financial instruments, such as our hedging agreement with Credit Suisse, to manage market risks and reduce our exposure to fluctuating electricity prices. These activities expose us to certain market risks, including unsuccessful matching of exposures or execution of our hedging strategy, and limit our ability to realize the full benefits of increases in energy prices. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in controlling risk within prescribed boundaries or limits as expected. In addition, future changes in markets may not be consistent with our historical data or assumptions. If we are not able to successfully anticipate and hedge against market risks, volatile electricity prices may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that managing our energy price exposure will reduce the volatility implicit in our business. However, it will also tend to reduce our ability to benefit from favorable energy price changes. Finally, hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty defaults. Changes in Interest Rates We are subject to interest rate risk under our bank facilities where the rate varies with changes in LIBOR rates. Although the first lien revolving turbine credit facility and the construction loan and equity bridge loan entered into in connection with the Initial New York Windparks each have variable interest rates that are based upon LIBOR, these loan facilities are used to finance construction activities and the related interest costs are capitalized. We have entered into interest swap contracts to protect against changes in the benchmark LIBOR interest rate on the variability of the specified future LIBOR interest payments relating to all but $20.0 million of the expected principal of our future Dexia term loan facility. As a result, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have no more than a $0.2 million impact on our annual interest expense. 60 DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS Senior Secured Turbine Credit Facilities First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility In October 2007, our indirect subsidiary, NEP Equipment Finance Co., LLC, as the borrower, entered into a revolving first lien senior secured promissory note, or the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility, with HSH Nordbank AG, New York Branch, as collateral agent, administrative agent and mandated lead arranger, KeyBank National Association, as lead arranger, and certain other financial institutions as lenders. Borrowings under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility are used to finance the purchase of wind turbines under certain turbine supply agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and GE. The First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility provides for up to $460.0 million in borrowings and will mature in March 2010. As of December 31, 2007, we had $230.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under this facility. Loan Maximum Outstanding The maximum amount of loans that can be outstanding at any time under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility is the sum of (i) 80% of the amount of the contract price under the turbine supply agreements (excluding amounts solely attributable to transportation costs), as the contract price may be adjusted from time to time (including in connection with the permitted exercise of options to purchase additional equipment or services under those agreements and as may be necessary to give effect to any reduction associated with any appraisal (as described below) of turbines required under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility), provided that if any turbine has not been allocated to a qualified project, the percentage specified above shall be reduced to 60%, (ii) all interest and fees under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility and (iii) 80% of the historic financing costs in respect of the turbine supply agreements in an aggregate amount not to exceed $18.2 million. Certain projects identified in the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility have been pre-approved as qualified projects. Further projects need to be approved by a committee of lenders and the administrative agent (based on procedures and criteria specified in the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility) in order to become qualified projects. Projects can lose their status as "qualified projects" for various reasons specified in the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility, including (i) circumstances in which it is clear (based on specified procedures, which include independent third-party review by a specified engineer if the parties are unable to agree) that the particular project will not achieve completion sufficiently in advance of the expiration date for PTCs applicable to such project and (ii) circumstances in which the equity interests in the applicable owner of the applicable project have not been pledged to the lenders as required under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility. In addition to the foregoing, if the then-current expiration date for PTCs has not been extended beyond December 31, 2009 (with tax benefits similar to or better than the PTCs applicable under the current PTC), the maximum amount that we are entitled to draw under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility with respect to turbines to be purchased by Noble Environmental Power 2009 Equipment Co. under its turbine supply agreement is $150.0 million. Required Take Out and Appraisal On or prior to the dates specified in the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility, we are required to have repaid a portion of the indebtedness under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility applicable to certain turbines (based on the turbine supply agreement under which such turbines were purchased). In event that amounts are not so repaid, so long as the warranty under the applicable turbine supply agreements will be in effect for at least 24 months after the expected 61 commercial operation date of the project to which such turbines have been allocated, the applicable turbines are subjected to an appraisal procedure specified in the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility. If the appraisal indicates a value that is more than 3% less than the purchase price under the applicable turbine supply agreement, we are required to recalculate the amount of indebtedness permitted to be outstanding under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility (using 80% or 60%, as applicable, of the appraised value, as opposed to the purchase price) and repay the difference. This appraisal procedure is repeated every four months until the indebtedness applicable to such turbines has been repaid. If, during appraisal procedure process, the warranty under the applicable turbine supply agreements will not be in effect for at least 24 months after the expected commercial operation date of the project to which such turbines have been allocated, we are required to immediately repay all indebtedness in respect of such turbines. Interest Rate and Fees All borrowings under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility accrue interest, at the election of the borrower, at LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.75% per annum or a prime rate plus a margin equal to 1.75% per annum. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility, we are also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 1.375% per annum of the daily average undrawn portion of the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility, which shall accrue from October 2007 and is payable quarterly in arrears. Equity Investment The First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility provides that NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC, the parent of the borrower and one of our subsidiaries, from time to time shall invest equity in the borrower such that its investment is at all times equal to or greater than the aggregate of: (i) 25% of the amount of first lien senior loans outstanding (other than loans applied to the contract price at the 60% advance rate described above); (ii) 66.66% of the amount of loans applied to the contract price at the 60% advance rate described above; and (iii) the amount by which the Loan Maximum Outstanding described above may be reduced from time to time due to an appraisal. NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC has raised financing for the equity investment through the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility described below. Prepayments The borrower may voluntarily prepay the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The borrower is obligated to make a mandatory prepayment of loans under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility: (i) to the extent that the Loan Maximum Outstanding as described above is exceeded (including after giving effect to any reduction in the Loan Maximum Outstanding resulting from the removal of the turbines or termination of any turbine supply agreement or any failure to have turbines thereunder allocated to a qualified project); (ii) as and when specified above under the heading "Required Take Out and Appraisal;" and (iii) to the extent that amounts available to be borrowed under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility (together with any equity and permitted alternative debt funding sources available to the borrower) are less than the aggregate contract price remaining to be paid for 62 turbines financed under the turbine supply agreements (in excess of a 10% payment to be made at the commissioning of turbines). Security The borrower's obligations under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the borrower (which consist primarily of its ownership interests in the equity interests of our subsidiaries who are parties to the turbine supply agreements) and a first priority pledge of the equity interests in the borrower by NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC, as well as the turbine supply agreements (and the turbines supplied thereunder). Certain Covenants and Events of Default The First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the borrower's ability to incur debt, grant liens, sell or lease certain assets, transfer equity interests, dissolve, pay dividends and make other distributions and change its business. The First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility also includes customary affirmative covenants and events of default (including a cross-default to our Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility described below) as well as a requirement to maintain sufficient availability (through the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility or other acceptable financing sources, including equity) in order to permit us to make required payments under the turbine supply agreements and to pay the related interest and fees. Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility In October 2007, NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC, as the borrower, entered into a second lien secured promissory note, or the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility, with Paragon Noble LLC, as lender, to finance NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC's obligations to make equity investment under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility. The Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility provides for a $260.0 million senior secured term loan that will mature in July 2010. As of December 31, 2007, we had $260.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under this facility. Interest Rate All borrowings under the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility accrue interest at 15% per annum. Prepayments After October 26, 2008, the borrower may voluntarily prepay the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Voluntary prepayments made prior to October 26, 2008 are subject to a make-whole premium based on the U.S. Treasury rate plus 50 basis points. If the principal amount outstanding under the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility ever exceeds the aggregate of (i) the positive difference, if any, between the amount of the aggregate contract price paid under all turbine supply agreements (excluding amounts solely attributable to transportation costs but reflecting applicable adjustments, if any, pursuant to the permitted exercise of options to purchase additional turbines under those agreements or any reduction associated with any appraisal of turbines required under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility) and any amounts borrowed under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility and used to fund such payments plus (ii) $40.0 million, the borrower is required to make a mandatory prepayment of the loans in an amount equal to such excess (which amounts may not be reborrowed) or to post cash collateral in amount equal to such excess 63 (which amount can be withdrawn to the extent such excess no longer exists). Any mandatory prepayment will be without premium or penalty. Guarantee and Security The obligations under the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility are secured by a second priority lien on the assets that secure the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility. NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC's obligations under the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility are also secured by a first priority pledge of the membership interests in NEP Equipment Finance Hold Co., LLC and in Noble Environmental Power 2009 Equipment Co., LLC, a party to a turbine supply agreement with GE, as well as a first priority pledge of the rights of Noble Environmental Power 2009 Equipment Co. in such turbine supply agreement. The pledge with respect to Noble Environmental Power 2009 Equipment Co. will become a second priority pledge at such time as it is required to be pledged under the First Lien Revolving Turbine Credit Facility. The obligations under the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility are also supported by a guarantee by Noble Environmental Power, LLC. The guarantee contains a number of covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, Noble Environmental Power, LLC's ability to incur debt, grant liens, sell or lease certain assets, transfer equity interests in the borrower under the Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility, dissolve or enter into certain merger transactions. The guarantee also contains customary representations and warranties and reporting requirements. Certain Covenants and Events of Default The Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the borrower's ability to incur debt, grant liens, sell or lease certain assets, transfer equity interests, any dividends, dissolve or change its business. The Second Lien Turbine Credit Facility also includes customary affirmative covenants and events of default. Letter of Credit Facility On February 14, 2008, our subsidiary, Noble Credit Funding, LLC, or Noble Credit, entered into a Master Credit Agreement with RBS Citizens, National Association, or RBS. The Master Credit Agreement is a revolving letter of credit facility, under which RBS may issue, on behalf of Noble Credit or any of its affiliates, one or more standby letters of credit to third parties, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Master Credit Agreement. The maximum amount of letter of credit obligations that may be outstanding at any time under the Master Credit Agreement is $45.0 million. The Master Credit Agreement expires on February 14, 2010, and all letters of credit issued under the agreement must expire at least ten days prior to such date. As of April 28, 2008, there was a face amount of $30.3 million outstanding under letters of credit issued pursuant to the Master Credit Agreement. Noble Credit is required to cash collateralize 100% of the face value of each letter of credit issued under the Master Credit Agreement. Pursuant to a Pledge and Security Agreement, Noble Credit granted RBS a security interest in any cash collateral, provided that RBS may not foreclose on any cash collateral if such foreclosure would lead to the cancellation of any outstanding letter of credit. In addition, Noble Credit issued to RBS a Revolving Credit Note, under which RBS may demand payment of any fees or expenses payable to RBS if Noble Credit does not pay on a timely basis or if RBS is unable to access the cash collateral after a certain period. Neither Noble Credit's failure to pay any fees or other amounts due under the Master Credit Agreement nor the existence of an obligation under the Revolving Credit Note gives RBS the right to cancel any outstanding letter of credit. 64 Initial New York Project Financing Construction Loan, Equity Bridge Loan, Term Loan and Letters of Credit In June 2007, an indirect subsidiary of the company, Noble Environmental Power 2006 Hold Co, LLC, which we refer to as NEP NY 2006, entered into a financing agreement with (i) Dexia Credit Local, New York Branch, as lead arranger, joint bookrunner, technical and documentation agent, co-syndication agent, LC fronting bank and administrative agent for the lenders, (ii) HSH Nordbank AG, New York Branch, as lead arranger, joint bookrunner and co-syndication agent and (iii) the other lenders party thereto to fund the Initial New York Windparks. The financing provided for a construction loan of up to $305.4 million in the aggregate and an equity bridge loan of up to $179.6 million, each with a maturity date of May 16, 2008. In addition, in connection with the construction loan, we provided a maximum $15.0 million guaranty to cover cost overruns, completion reserves and the repayment of any portion of the construction loan that could not be converted. Upon the satisfaction of the conditions in the financing agreement, which include the investment of tax equity in NEP NY 2006, the construction loan and a portion of the equity bridge loan will convert into a term loan. We refer to the date of this conversion as term conversion. There is also an additional $76.5 million available in letters of credit (of which no more than $45.0 million can be outstanding under the energy hedge letter of credit and no more than $31.5 million can be outstanding under the debt service reserve account letter of credit). The term loan and the letters of credit will mature approximately ten years after the date of term conversion. Additionally, upon term conversion, a portion of the equity bridge loan discussed above will be repaid from the proceeds of the initial equity investment by EFS Noble Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation, in the borrower. Interest Rate All borrowings under the construction loan and the equity bridge loan accrue interest at LIBOR plus: (i) 1.375% from June 22, 2007 to July 30, 2007; and (ii) 1.250% from and including July 30, 2007, to but excluding the date of term conversion. All borrowings under the term loan will accrue interest at LIBOR plus: (i) 1.250% from and including the date of term conversion to but excluding the fifth annual anniversary thereof; (ii) 1.375% from and including the fifth annual anniversary of the date of term conversion to but excluding the ninth annual anniversary thereof; and (iii) 1.500% from and including the ninth anniversary of the Term Conversion Date to and including the date the term loan matures. Distribution Reserve Account Amounts that would otherwise be available for distribution to the equity holders except for the failure to meet the distribution requirements will be held in the distribution reserve account until such distribution requirements are met. The distribution requirements include that distributions may be made only after the first repayment date following commencement of operations at our windparks, that no event of default has occurred or is continuing and that the reserve and other accounts are fully funded. Any amounts held in the distribution reserve account for more than twenty-four consecutive months will be used to prepay the loans. 65 Prepayments The borrower may, at its option, prepay the construction loan, the equity bridge loan, the term loan, the debt service reserve account letter of credit or the energy hedge letter of credit, provided that, after giving effect to any such prepayment, the outstanding obligations under such loans do not exceed $20.0 million in the aggregate. The borrower is only permitted to make such prepayment if concurrently with such prepayment it replaces the energy hedge letter of credit issued by Dexia (without causing any draw by the energy hedge provider on such energy hedge letter of credit) with a replacement energy hedge letter of credit issued by a person acceptable to the energy hedge provider. The borrower is obligated to make a mandatory prepayment of loans: (i) to the extent a change in law makes it unlawful or impossible for a lender to make or maintain the loans and (ii) to the extent that any amounts have remained undisbursed in the distribution reserve account for 24 consecutive months. Security The borrower's obligations under the construction and equity bridge loans are, and the term loan will be, secured by a first priority lien, subject to certain permitted liens, on the assets of the borrower including its interest in the project companies which own the Initial New York Windparks, and a first priority pledge of the equity interests in the borrower by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Noble Environmental Power Hold Co. Prime, LLC, which we refer to as Noble Prime, as well as pledges of the equity interests in the borrower's subsidiaries and their assets (including the turbine supply agreements). The borrower's obligations under the construction and equity bridge loans are, and the term loan will be, also secured by a first priority pledge of the equity interests in the borrower by EFS Noble Holdings. Certain Covenants and Events of Default of Term Loan The construction loan and equity bridge loan contain and the term loan will contain a number of covenants including those that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the borrower's ability to incur other debt, grant liens, sell or lease certain assets, transfer equity interests, lose material permits, modify permits, modify documents, dissolve, pay dividends and make other distributions and change its business. The construction loan and the equity bridge loan include and the term loan will include customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a cross-default for certain other debt of the borrower and its subsidiaries. Membership Interest Purchase and Equity Capital Contribution Agreement In June 2007, Noble Prime and NEP NY 2006 entered into a Membership Interest Purchase and Equity Capital Contribution Agreement, or ECCA, with EFS Noble Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of GE, which we refer to as EFS. Pursuant to the ECCA, on the date of term conversion, NEP NY 2006 will issue (i) Class A membership interests to the Class A members in exchange for the equity capital contribution of the Class A members, and (ii) Class B membership interests to Noble Prime in exchange for Noble Prime's original membership interests in NEP NY 2006. The ECCA provides for the equity capital contribution of the Class A members to be made in up to four installments. The amount of the initial equity capital contribution made on the term conversion date will be based on the number of wind turbines in our Initial New York Windparks that have achieved substantial completion as of such date. If applicable, the balance of the equity capital contribution of the Class A members will be made as the remaining wind turbines achieve substantial completion. 66 Upon execution of the ECCA, Noble Environmental Power, LLC issued a guaranty in favor of the Class A member of the amounts due and payable by the Class B member to the Class A member under the indemnity provisions of the ECCA and under the New York 2006 LLC Agreement. The guaranteed amount is limited to the aggregate amount of equity capital contributions of the Class A member, less any cash distributed to such member pursuant to the New York 2006 LLC Agreement. Pay-As-You-Go Capital Contribution Agreement At the time Noble Prime entered into the ECCA, it also entered into a Pay-As-You-Go Capital Contribution Agreement, or PAYG agreement, pursuant to which the Class A members have agreed to make additional capital contributions to NEP NY 2006 at the end of each fiscal quarter period based on the amount of PTCs generated by the projects. This obligation will become effective on the date of term conversion, with EFS's initial equity capital contribution, and generally will end on the date the "flip point" occurs, which will be the earlier of (i) the later of the tenth anniversary of the equity capital contribution date or the date the Class A members realize their target after-tax rate of return, or "flip rate," and (ii) the date the Class A members realize the flip rate and the term loan is repaid. The Class A members' obligations under the PAYG agreement will terminate prior to the flip point in the event title to all Class A membership interests is transferred to the term loan lenders. From and after the date on which the Class A members realize the flip rate, if the obligations of NEP NY 2006 under the term loan have not been fully repaid, NEP NY 2006 must apply all of the PAYG capital contributions relating to periods after the flip rate is realized to prepay the term loan. Only wind energy sold to unrelated parties qualifies for the PTC. However, the parties have agreed that if a Class A member or its affiliate becomes a related party and fails to comply with its obligations under the New York 2006 LLC Agreement to take all actions necessary to cease being a related party (and Noble Prime complied with its obligations under the New York 2006 LLC Agreement), the PAYG capital contributions will be made as if the Class A member had not become a related party. Conversely, if a Class A member becomes a related party as a result of Noble Prime's failure to comply with its obligations under the New York 2006 LLC Agreement, then the PAYG capital contributions will be reduced to account for the failure to qualify for PTCs and will be further reduced by the amount of any damages owed to the Class A member in accordance with the New York 2006 LLC Agreement. See also "Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company AgreementIndemnification ObligationsRelated Party Problems." Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement Pursuant to the ECCA, on the date of term conversion, Noble Prime will enter into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, or New York 2006 LLC Agreement, governing NEP NY 2006 in connection with the initial equity investment by EFS in our Initial New York Windparks. NEP NY 2006 holds all the interests in three subsidiary limited liability companies, or project companies, which hold the assets of the Initial New York Windparks. The New York 2006 LLC Agreement will provide for two classes of membership interests, Class A membership interests and Class B membership interests. We expect that we will hold 100% of the outstanding Class B membership interests, and EFS will hold 100% of the outstanding Class A membership interests. Management Under the terms of the New York 2006 LLC Agreement, Noble Prime will be the managing member of NEP NY 2006 and will be responsible for its day-to-day operations, subject to certain approval rights of the Class A members described below. The day-to-day administration and operation 67 of the projects will be delegated to our subsidiaries, Noble Management Services, LLC and Noble Wind Operations, LLC, pursuant to agreements between the project companies and these entities. Prior to the flip point, material actions will require the approval of Class A members holding a majority of the Class A membership interests. After the flip point, the approval rights of the Class A members will be limited to a small subset of these material actions reflecting the Class A members' reduced minority interest. Material actions will include significant matters relating to the management and operation of NEP NY 2006 and the project companies and approval of an annual operating budget. As managing member, Noble Prime will be required to perform its obligations under the New York 2006 LLC Agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement and the standards set forth therein. As managing member, Noble Prime will be required to perform its duties and its obligations at all times in good faith and in the best interest of NEP NY 2006 and the project companies. In addition, in instances involving, directly or indirectly, the construction, operation and management of the Initial New York Windparks, Noble Prime will be required to act in accordance with a prudent operator standard. In discharging its duties as managing member, Noble Prime will be permitted to rely on legal counsel, qualified industry consultants or other advisors. Noble Prime will be able to be removed as managing member only upon the occurrence of certain special events described below. Allocations and Distributions Profits, losses and other tax items (including PTCs and accelerated tax depreciation) will be allocated 100% to the Class A members until the flip point occurs. Thereafter, profits, losses and other tax items will be allocated 5% to the Class A members and 95% to the Class B members. The flip point will be the earlier of (i) the later of the tenth anniversary of the Class A members' equity capital contribution or the date the Class A members realize the flip rate, and (ii) the date the Class A members realize the flip rate and the term loan is repaid. The flip rate will be a pre-determined after-tax internal rate of return, taking into account cash contributions and distributions as well as the tax benefits (primarily PTCs and accelerated depreciation) and tax costs realized by the Class A members. The calculation of the flip rate will be done as necessary on a monthly basis by the managing member, in accordance with a model based on certain fixed assumptions relating to tax rates, depreciation methods and conventions, and the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction to the members, but taking into account the actual amount of particular items realized or deemed realized by NEP NY 2006 and the project companies. In the event the IRS were to successfully challenge these allocations based on non-binding guidance issued prior to the Class A members' equity capital contribution, or such guidance were to become binding law, and the allocations are negatively impacted, the flip point could be delayed. Distributable cash initially will be distributed 100% to the Class B member until the earlier of (i) the date the Class B member's capital account is first reduced to zero or (ii) the date that Class B member's capital account is projected to first reach zero under certain probability modeling. Thereafter cash will be distributed 100% to the Class A members until the flip point occurs, except that if the Class A members realize their flip rate before the term loan has been repaid, then 95% of the distributable cash will be used to service the term loan. After the flip point, cash will be distributed 5% to the Class A members and 95% to the Class B member. Indemnification Obligations The New York 2006 LLC Agreement will provide that any member who breaches the New York 2006 LLC Agreement may be held liable to any other member, NEP NY 2006 or the project companies for any damages (including the value of any lost PTCs) sustained by such person as a result of the breach. In addition, members will make certain covenants to each other, the breach of which 68 could result in indemnification obligations to NEP NY 2006, the project companies and/or other members, including:  Related Party Problems. Only wind energy sold to unrelated parties qualifies for the PTC. Accordingly, to avoid potential related party problems, as managing member, Noble Prime will be obligated to notify the members prior to entering into any power sales agreement. If Noble Prime fails to notify the members as required and, as a result, any member becomes a related party, Noble Prime will be obligated to indemnify the members for any damages (including the value of lost PTCs) suffered as a result. Conversely, if any member becomes a related party and fails to comply with its obligations to take all actions necessary to cease being a related party, such member will be obligated to indemnify NEP NY 2006, the project company and the other members for any damages (including the value of lost PTCs) suffered as a result.  Array Loss. The Class B member will agree not to develop or construct any windpark, other than our projects in development in Chateaugay and Bellmont, within 20 rotor diameters of the projects if it could reasonably be expected to result in a 0.5% or greater reduction of the net annual energy output of the projects, unless the Class B member agrees to compensate the affected project for any damages. If the reduction could reasonably be expected to be 2.0% or greater, the Class B member will be required to obtain the approval of a majority of the Class A members. With respect to our projects in development in Chateaugay and Bellmont, the Class B member will enter into a separate affiliate array loss agreement setting forth the terms of compensation payable to the affected projects.  Estoppel and New York State Electric and Gas, or NYSEG, Events. NEP NY 2006 will agree to indemnify the Class A members in certain circumstances if its failure to obtain all necessary estoppels prior to the initial equity capital contribution of EFS results in an impairment of the net annual energy output of the affected project. NEP NY 2006 similarly will agree to indemnify the Class A members in certain circumstances in the event of a dispute with NYSEG that results in an impairment of the net annual energy output of the affected project. In either case, any indemnification will be paid by means of a priority distribution of cash from NEP NY 2006. These indemnification rights and obligations will not be exclusive and will be in addition to any rights and remedies available to NEP NY 2006, the project company or the members at law or in equity. Special Events The New York 2006 LLC Agreement will provide that upon the occurrence of certain "special events" prior to the flip point, the Class A members may exercise the following rights, in addition to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, including seeking damages if the Class B member fails to cure the special event and fully indemnify the Class A members for any damages sustained as a result of the special event within 30 days of receiving notice of the special event: (i) cause NEP NY 2006 to withhold distributions otherwise payable to the Class B member; (ii) remove Noble Prime as managing member; and (iii) take material actions on behalf of NEP NY 2006 or any project company without the Class B member's consent. Special events will include: (i) the bankruptcy of NEP NY 2006 or any project company; (ii) bankruptcy of the Class B member if it has a material adverse effect; (iii) a breach or default under any principal project document if it has a material adverse effect; (iv) a default under the term loan that results in the acceleration of the obligation or a payment default that is not timely cured; (v) failure to make required distributions; (vi) a change of control of the Class B member not otherwise permitted (which will not include a change of control of Noble Environmental Power, LLC); (vii) a violation of law that has a material adverse effect or results in criminal liability of NEP NY 2006 or any project company and (viii) the commission of fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. 69 Transfers Under the terms of the New York 2006 LLC Agreement, the members' ability to transfer their interests in NEP NY 2006 will be subject to general restrictions, including prohibitions on the transfer of interests to competitors of NEP NY 2006, persons adverse to NEP NY 2006, the project companies or the members, persons who purchase electricity from NEP NY 2006 and other disqualified transferees. In addition, the New York 2006 LLC Agreement will provide that prior to the flip point, the Class B member may not transfer more than 49% of its Class B membership interest without the consent of the Class A member, and the Class A member may only transfer its Class A membership to a transferee that meets minimum credit rating requirements and who expressly assumes the Class A member's obligations under the PAYG agreement. These same restrictions also will apply to the transfer of controlling interests in the members. After the flip point, if the Class B member receives a bona fide third-party offer to acquire all of the membership interests in NEP NY 2006, the Class B member will have the right to force the Class A members to join the sale provided the purchase price of the Class A membership interests is at least fair market value. If the Class B member does not elect to exercise these drag-along rights, the Class A members will have the right to force the Class B member to purchase their interests if not purchased by the third-party. Redemption and Buyout Rights The New York 2006 LLC Agreement will provide that the Class B member will have the right to purchase for fair market value all, but not less than all, of the outstanding Class A membership interests upon the later of the flip point or the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the New York 2006 LLC Agreement, and on the fifth anniversary of the later of the two dates. In addition, the Class B member will have the option to cause the redemption of the Class A members at a significant premium upon the occurrence of any transaction that results in a change of control of Noble Environmental Power, LLC after the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the New York 2006 LLC Agreement. The Class B member also will have the right, in certain circumstances, to cause the redemption of a Class A member that objects to any material action requiring their consent. In the case of any such redemption, the Class B member will be required to contribute sufficient cash to NEP NY 2006 necessary to enable NEP NY 2006 to redeem the Class A member or members for an amount equal to, at the option of the Class A member, fair market value or an amount that will result in the redeemed Class A members having realized a pre-determined after-tax internal rate of return. All members will have the right to acquire for fair market value the membership interests of any member that becomes bankrupt or can no longer legally remain a member or any Class A member that fails to maintain the minimum required credit rating. 70 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Renewable energy is produced using resources that are naturally replenished, such as wind, sunlight, geothermal heat, tides and biofuels. Technologies that produce energy from these renewable sources (other than biofuels) are often referred to as "clean" or "green" as they produce few, if any, pollutants that negatively impact the environment. Comparatively, fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil are exhaustible and release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide or other pollutants into the atmosphere during energy production. As a result of increased environmental awareness, the deployment of renewable energy technologies has grown rapidly during the past several years, with 26% of new U.S. power generation capacity in 2006 consisting of renewable technologies, compared with only 2% in 2003. This increase is expected to continue, with the American Council on Renewable Energy forecasting renewable energy capacity to grow by a compounded annual growth rate of 11% through 2025, yielding a potential 550,000700,000 MW of additional renewable capacity. At this rate, the United States could supply 25% of its electrical energy requirements with renewable energy by 2025. Wind energy is the fastest-growing renewable energy generation technology worldwide due to its cost efficiency, technological maturity, and the wide availability of wind resources. We believe that it has the greatest potential among all renewable energy technologies for further growth in the United States. Although the United States has hydroelectric and geothermal resources, many potential hydroelectric sites have already been developed and geothermal production is confined by geographical limitations to only certain areas of the United States. In contrast, according to the American Wind Energy Association, or AWEA, the available untapped wind resources across the United States remain vast. Additionally, other renewable energy technologies, such as solar power, are currently less economically attractive than wind energy, and others, such as biofuels, emit particulates which have a greater negative impact on the environment than wind energy. Growth in U.S. Wind Energy We believe that the growth in U.S. wind energy will continue due to a number of key factors, including:  Increases in electricity demand coupled with the rising cost of fossil fuels used for conventional energy generation resulting in increases in electricity prices;  Heightened environmental concerns, creating legislative and popular support to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases;  Regulatory mandates, such as state RPS programs, as well as federal tax incentives including PTCs and accelerated tax depreciation;  Improvements in wind energy technology;  Increasing obstacles for the construction of conventional fuel plants; and  Abundant wind resources in attractive energy markets within the United States. From its beginnings in California, wind energy in the United States has expanded steadily to 35 of the 50 states. As depicted on the maps on the next page, the total installed capacity of U.S. windparks increased by over 570% from 2,500 MW to over 16,800 MW between December 1999 and December 2007. 71 Source: American Wind Energy Association, January 16, 2008 According to AWEA, installed U.S. wind capacity increased by 2,426 MW (27%) in 2006, and over 5,244 MW (45%) in 2007. Despite this growth, wind energy generation still only represented just under 1% of U.S. electricity supply in 2006, and we believe that the prospects for further growth are very favorable. According to Emerging Energy Research, wind energy could provide approximately 50,000 MW of installed capacity in the United States by 2015. The chart on the next page illustrates the projected growth of U.S. wind capacity through 2015. 72 Historical and Forecasted U.S. Installed Wind Capacity Source: Emerging Energy Research, June 2007. Increases in Electricity Demand Coupled with the Rising Cost of Fossil Fuels Used for Conventional Energy Generation The demand for electricity has historically exhibited steady growth and has increased by a cumulative amount of 22% or 656 billion kWh from 1995 through 2006. According to the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, electricity demand in the United States is forecasted to continue to grow at a steady long-term rate with a cumulative increase from 2007 through 2030 of 32%. Most of this demand has historically been supplied by coal- or natural gas-fired power plants, which accounted for 49% and 20%, respectively, of U.S. electrical power generation in 2006. Many of the most densely populated regions in the United States (including the population centers in New York, New England, Texas and California) rely on natural gas for a significant portion of their electricity production, and this high usage, combined with the increased presence of natural gas-fired power plants, has made it the fuel that determines the price of power in these markets. We believe that the significant increases in commodity fuel prices have spurred demand for alternative fuels such as wind energy. From 1998 to 2007, the average price of natural gas increased by approximately 235%, while the average price of oil increased by 402% over the same period. The following two charts illustrate the price increases of input fuel commodities such as crude oil and natural gas as well as retail electricity in New York and Texas. 73 Indexed Price of Oil and Natural Gas Source: Bloomberg. Average of daily oil and natural gas prices for each year during the period from 1998 to 2007. 1. Oil index is the West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price; 100% = $14.38 per barrel. 2.

Wind energy, which has no fuel costs, has become much more competitive by comparison to traditional electricity generation sources, and has grown dramatically relative to other non-hydroelectric renewable sources (including biofuels, geothermal and solar) in recent years, as shown in the following two charts. 74 Comparative Cost of Electric Power Generation Source: IEA / NEA 2005 Projected Costs of Generating Electricity, 2005. United States Wind Generation Growth Source: Energy Information Administration 1. Non-hydro renewables consist of wind, solar, geothermal and biomass Wind energy also offers an attractive method of managing commodity price risk while maintaining strict environmental standards, as it provides a stable, affordable hedge against the risk of increases in the price of coal, natural gas and other fuels over time. Increasing the use of wind energy also has the implied benefit of lowering overall demand for natural gas, particularly during winter peak demand. We believe that concern over the recent increases in fuel prices in the United States, coupled with the country's significant dependence on fossil fuels, has been a factor in the political and social movement towards greater use of clean energy. 75 Heightened Environmental Concerns, Creating Legislative and Popular Support to Reduce Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases The growing concern over global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions has also contributed to the growth in the wind energy industry. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, experts have noted that eleven of the last twelve years (19952006) rank among the warmest years since 1850. Additionally, the global average sea level has risen at an average rate of 1.8 millimeters per year since 1961 and at 3.1 millimeters per year since 1993, due to the melting of glaciers, ice caps and polar ice sheets, coupled with thermal expansion of the oceans. The importance of reducing greenhouse gases has been recognized by the international community, as demonstrated by the signing and ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires reductions in greenhouse gases by the 177 (as of March 2008) signatory nations. While the United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, state-level initiatives have been undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. California was the first state to pass global warming legislation, and ten states on the east coast have signed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which proposes to require a 10% reduction in power plant carbon dioxide emissions by 2019. Substituting wind energy for traditional fossil fuel-fired generation would help reduce CO 2 emissions due to the environmentally-friendly attributes of wind energy. According to the EIA, the United States had the highest CO 2 emissions of all countries in the world in 2005, contributing approximately 20% of the world's CO 2 emissions. Since 1990, CO 2 emissions from the United States' electric power industry have increased by a cumulative amount of 27%, from 1.9 billion metric tons to 2.5 billion metric tons. Indexed Electric Power Industry CO 2 Emissions: 19902006 Source: Energy Information Administration 1. 1990: 100% = 1.9 Billion Metric Tons of CO 2 . Environmental legislation and regulations provide additional incentives for the development of wind energy by increasing the marginal cost of energy generated through fossil-fuel technologies. For example, regulations such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the Regional Haze Rule have been designed to reduce ozone concentrations, particulate emissions and haze and other requirements to control mercury emissions can require conventional energy generators to make significant expenditures, implement pollution control measures or purchase emissions credits to meet compliance requirements. These measures have increased fossil fuel-fired generators' capital and operating costs and put upward pressure on the market price of energy. Because wind energy producers are price takers in energy markets, these legislative measures effectively serve to make the return on wind energy more attractive relative to other sources of generation. 76 We believe there is significant support in the U.S. to enact legislation which will attempt to reduce the amount of carbon produced by electrical generators. Although the ultimate form of legislation is still being debated, the two most likely alternatives are (i) a direct emissions tax or (ii) a cap-and-trade regime. We believe either of these alternatives would likely result in higher overall power prices, as the marginal cost of electricity in the U.S. is generally set by carbon intensive generation assets which burn fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal. As a non-carbon emitter and a market price taker, we are positioned to benefit from these higher power prices. Regulatory Mandates, Such as State RPS Programs, as Well as Federal Tax Incentives Including Production Tax Credits and Accelerated Tax Depreciation Growth in the United States' wind energy market has also been driven by state and federal legislation designed to encourage the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies. This support includes:  Renewable Portfolio Standards. In response to the push for cleaner power generation and more secure energy supplies, many states have enacted RPS programs. These programs either require electric utilities and other retail energy suppliers to produce or acquire a certain percentage of their annual electricity consumption from renewable power generation resources, or, as the case in New York, designate an entity to administer the central procurement of RECs for the state. Wind energy producers generate renewable energy certificates due to the environmentally beneficial attributes associated with their production of electricity. The number of states with RPS programs has doubled in the last six years and as of April 2008, 31 states and the District of Columbia had adopted some form of RPS program. The District of Columbia and 25 of the 31 states have mandatory RPS requirements and combined, these 25 states represent over 50% of total U.S. electrical load. A number of states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Texas, have been so successful in meeting their original RPS targets that they have revised their programs to include higher targets. Other states such as Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont and Virginia have adopted state goals, which set targets, not requirements, for certain percentages of total energy to be generated from renewable resources. The states that have adopted RPS or set state goals, as well as the related requirements or targets, are set forth in the following map. U.S. RPS Programs and Goals for Renewable Energy Generation Source: United States Department of EnergyEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, April 2008. 77 Almost every state that has implemented an RPS program will need considerable additional renewable energy capacity to meet its RPS requirements. Much of Emerging Energy Research's forecasted 50,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2015 will be driven by current and proposed RPS targets, along with additional demand from states without renewable standards.  Renewable Energy Certificates. A REC is a stand-alone tradable instrument representing the attributes associated with one MWh of energy produced from a renewable energy source. These attributes typically include reduced air and water pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased use of domestic energy sources. Many states use RECs to track and verify compliance with their RPS programs. Retail energy suppliers can meet the requirements by purchasing RECs from renewable energy generators, in addition to producing or acquiring the electricity from renewable sources. Under many RPS programs, energy providers that fail to meet RPS requirements are assessed a penalty for the shortfall, usually known as an alternative compliance payment. Because RECs can be purchased to satisfy the RPS requirements and avoid an alternative compliance payment, the amount of the alternative compliance payment effectively sets a cap on REC prices. In situations where REC supply is short, REC prices approach the alternative compliance payment, which in several states is in the $50-$59/MWh range. As a result, REC prices can rival the price of energy and RECs can represent a significant additional revenue stream for wind energy generators.  Production Tax Credits. The PTC provides wind energy generators with a credit against federal income taxes, annually adjusted for inflation, for a duration of ten years from the date that the wind turbine is placed into service. In 2007, the PTC was $20/MWh. Wind energy generators with insufficient taxable income to benefit from the PTC may take advantage of a variety of investment structures to monetize the tax benefits. The PTC was originally enacted in 1992 for windparks placed into service after December 31, 1993 and before July 1, 1999. The PTC subsequently has been extended five times, but has been allowed to lapse three times (for periods of three, six and nine months) prior to retroactive extension. Currently, the PTC is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2008 unless an extension or renewal is enacted into law.  Accelerated Tax Depreciation. Tax depreciation is a non-cash expense meant to approximate the loss of an asset's value over time and is generally the portion of an investment in an asset that can be deducted from taxable income in any given tax period. Current federal income tax law requires taxpayers to depreciate most tangible personal property placed in service after 1986 using the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, under which taxpayers are entitled to use the 200% or 150% declining balance method depending on the class of property, rather than the straight line method. In addition, under MACRS, a significant portion of windpark assets is deemed to have depreciable life of five years which is substantially shorter than the 15 to 25 year depreciable lives of many non-renewable power supply assets. This shorter depreciable life and the accelerated depreciation method results in a significantly accelerated realization of tax depreciation for windparks compared to other types of power projects. Wind energy generators with insufficient taxable income to benefit from this accelerated depreciation often monetize the accelerated depreciation, along with the PTCs, through forming a limited liability company with third parties. Improvements in Wind Energy Technology Wind turbine technology has improved considerably in recent years with significant increases in capacity and efficiency. Multiple types and sizes of turbines are now available to suit a wide range of wind resource characteristics and landscapes. Modern wind turbines are capable of generating high-quality, grid-compatible electricity for more than 25 years, with remote monitoring and relatively low maintenance. 78 There have been two major trends in the development of wind turbines in recent years:  individual turbine capacity has increased dramatically over the last 25 years, with 30 kW machines that operated in 1980 giving way to the 1.5 MW machines that are standard today; and  windpark performance has improved significantly, with turbines installed after 2005 averaging a 36% net capacity factor (the ratio of the actual output over a period of time and the output if the windpark had operated at full capacity over that time period) as compared to the 22.5% net capacity factor realized by turbines installed prior to 1998. Additionally, as wind energy technology has continued to improve, according to AWEA, the capital cost of wind energy generation has fallen by approximately 80% over the past 20 years. Increasing Obstacles for the Construction of Conventional Fuel Plants In addition to the impediments presented by the extensive and growing environmental legislation, new power plants that use conventional fuels, such as coal and nuclear technologies, face a difficult, lengthy and expensive permitting process. Furthermore, increasing opposition from public environmental groups towards coal-fired power plants, coupled with rising construction costs, contributed to the cancellation of many planned coal plants in 2007. According to Resource Media, a public relations firm representing environmental groups in the western United States, the construction of 31 coal-fired plants totaling 24,250 MW was canceled or delayed in 2007. As a result, despite increasing gross margins, only about 2,000 MW of net new capacity from coal and nuclear plants was brought online between 2003 and 2006. Additionally, in October 2007, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment became the first government agency in the United States to cite carbon dioxide emissions as the reason for rejecting an air permit for a proposed coal-fired electricity generating plant, saying that the greenhouse gas threatens public health and the environment. Traditional energy developers and utilities are likely to face similar permitting and restricted supply issues in the future. As a result, alternative energy sources such as wind will need to be developed to meet increasing electricity demand and will be able to capitalize on the resulting higher energy prices. 79 Abundant Wind Resources in Attractive Energy Markets within the United States The potential for future growth in the U.S. wind energy market is supported by the large land area available for turbine installations and the availability of significant wind resources. According to the AWEA, annual average wind speeds of 11 miles per hour or greater are required for grid-connected windparks. As shown in the map below, a large portion of the United States exhibits wind speeds sufficient for windpark development. Source: United States Department of EnergyPacific Northwest National Laboratory, October 1986. Wind Energy Fundamentals The term "wind energy" refers to the process used to generate electricity through wind turbines. The turbines convert wind's kinetic energy into electrical power by capturing it with a three blade rotor mounted on a nacelle that houses a gearbox and generator. When the wind blows, the combination of the lift and drag of the air pressure on the blades spins the blades and rotor, which turns a shaft through the gearbox and generator to create electricity. Wind turbines are typically grouped together in what are often referred to as "windparks." Electricity from each wind turbine travels down a cable inside its tower to a collection point in the windpark and is then transmitted to a substation for voltage step-up and delivery into the electric utility transmission network, or "grid." Today's wind turbines can efficiently generate electricity when the wind speed is between 11 and 55 miles per hour. A key factor in the success of any windpark is the profile and predictability of the wind resources at the site. Extensive studies of historical weather and wind patterns have been performed across North America and many resources, in the forms of charts, graphs and maps, are available to wind developers. The most attractive windpark sites offer a combination of land accessibility, power transmission, proximity to construction resources and strong and dependable winds. When wind energy developers identify promising sites, they perform detailed studies to provide greater certainty with respect to the long-term wind characteristics at the site and to identify the most effective turbine siting strategy. The long-term annual output of a windpark is assessed through the use of on-site wind data, publicly available reference data and sophisticated software. Wind speeds are 80 estimated in great detail for specific months, days or even hours, and are then correlated to turbine manufacturers' specifications to identify the most efficient turbine for the site. Additional calculations and adjustments for turbine availability (which is principally affected by planned and unplanned maintenance events), wake effects (wind depletion caused by turbines sited upwind), blade soiling and icing and other factors are made to arrive at an estimate of net expected annual kilowatt hour electricity production at the site. Sources of Revenue for Wind Generators Wind energy generators primarily derive revenue from three sources:  Energy sales. Energy sales are derived from the sale of energy into a wholesale market or to a specific customer, such as a utility or power marketer;  REC sales. In many states, conventional energy producers are required either to produce a certain percentage of their energy from renewable sources or to purchase RECs from renewable energy producers. RECs represent the environmental attributes associated with electricity from renewable sources. RECs are a tradable instrument that can be sold separately from the electricity produced by a renewable generation source, thereby providing an additional revenue stream; and  Capacity sales. In some, but not all states in which we are operating or developing windparks, payments are made to energy generators, including windparks, as a market incentive to promote the development and continued operation of capacity sufficient to meet regional load and reserve requirements. Market systems have been established to ensure that generators receive these payments based on their availability to generate electricity. Payments are generally allocated to windparks based on the previous year's capacity for the super-peak hours during winter and summer qualifying periods. 81 BUSINESS Company Overview We are a rapidly growing wind energy company operating 282 megawatts, or MW, of electrical generating capacity with more than 950 MW of additional capacity that we expect to commence operations during 2008 and 2009. We are focused on developing, financing, constructing, owning and operating windparks in attractive energy markets in the United States. Our strategy is to grow our business principally through organic development in regions with deregulated power markets, acceptable wind resources and favorable legislative and economic incentives such as renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, programs and active renewable energy certificate, or REC, markets. Through RPS programs and REC markets, we are able to monetize the environmental attributes associated with our power, in addition to generating revenue from the actual power we produce. Operating in these attractive deregulated energy markets also enables us to execute our energy hedging strategy, which helps stabilize our revenues while allowing us to benefit from future increases in energy prices. We were founded in August 2004 and commenced operations of our first windparks in March 2008. We have grown into a fully integrated wind energy company with 152 employees, with the capability to develop, finance, construct, own and operate our windparks. We utilize our understanding of the commodity markets to site our windparks in attractive regions and to monetize the output of our projects effectively. Our engineering and construction team has the ability to either act as general contractor on a project, coordinating with third-party construction contractors, or to engage a third-party in the general contractor or construction management role. We make these decisions based on economic benefit to us. We believe that this two-fold construction strategy differentiates us from other independent U.S. wind energy companies, which typically rely only upon third-party general contractors. Similarly, while we generally intend to operate and maintain our windparks ourselves, we retain the flexibility to use third-party service providers. This also differentiates us from other independent U.S. wind energy companies. In addition to our current capacity of 282 MW, we have begun construction of additional windparks in New York and Texas that we expect will provide 465 MW of capacity in 2008. We plan to grow our capacity significantly over the next several years. By the end of 2012, we expect to have approximately 3,850 MW of capacity as we further expand into attractive wind energy markets in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Vermont and Wyoming. In addition, we continuously identify and evaluate new windparks as part of our core business strategy. Windpark project development has been and will continue to be one of our core strengths and areas of focus. Based on our historical success in identifying new windpark projects, we expect that these project development efforts will result in an additional 4,000 MW development pipeline of windparks, which could be constructed after 2012. We also maintain strong relationships with major turbine suppliers, who we expect will provide the turbines required for our expanding windpark portfolio. We have secured access to the turbines needed for our projects slated for construction through 2009. We believe that the strong track record of our experienced management team, the expertise of our project development team dedicated to sourcing new opportunities, our integrated business model and our turbine supply relationships provide us with the knowledge and resources necessary to rapidly grow our windpark portfolio. 82 Growth in Our Windpark Portfolio (1) Capacity represents the maximum output, measured in megawatts, that an individual wind turbine generator is designed to produce. The capacity of a windpark equals the capacity of the generators multiplied by the number of generators included in the windparks. Our Windpark Portfolio Our operational project portfolio is located in New York and consists of three windparks: Bliss, Clinton and Ellenburg. We refer to these windparks as our "Initial New York Windparks." Additionally, we have 465 MW of projects currently in construction in New York at our Altona, Bellmont, Chateaugay and Wethersfield windparks and in Texas at phase I of our Great Plains windpark, all of which we expect to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. We also have 1,205 MW of projects currently in development, which we expect to commence operations in 2009 and 2010 and an additional 1,900 MW of projects in development, which we expect to commence operations during 2011 and 2012. Substantially all of these identified projects are located in attractive deregulated energy markets and in areas that we have determined have acceptable wind resources. For projects that we expect will commence operations between 2008 and 2010, we have secured control of the land necessary to construct our windparks, identified transmission interconnection and established relationships in the local communities. In addition, we have secured the turbines needed to support our windparks slated for construction through 2009. We focus on certain key energy market characteristics when identifying projects to add to our portfolio. Potential projects are then evaluated against our investment criteria to determine their attractiveness. The energy market characteristics are:  Liquid Energy Markets. We seek to locate our projects within established, deregulated energy markets, with price levels and market liquidity that provide us with attractive returns and greater hedging flexibility. Often these attractive markets are located in regions where gas fired electricity generation sets the market price the majority of the time, or where tight supply/demand balances result in attractive market clearing prices, and where an independent system operator administers the energy markets, creating price visibility and physical liquidity.  Active REC Markets. We also look at whether the state or region in which the potential site will be located has an RPS program that presents an opportunity to generate additional revenues through the sale of RECs. These credits represent the monetization of wind energy's environmental benefits and are generally purchased by electric utilities or other retail energy suppliers, or procured by a state agency as mandated by state law (as is the case in New York). 83  Available Capacity Markets. When we consider whether to site a windpark in a particular location, we also evaluate the opportunity for receiving payments in the capacity market. In certain markets, capacity payments are paid to generators for having operating generation facilities capable of producing energy within the applicable power pools and provide additional revenues to enhance the economics of our projects. In addition to exhibiting key energy market characteristics, our projects must also meet a stringent set of development criteria and are regularly evaluated to ensure that key milestones are being met. These development criteria are:  Land Control. For us to consider this milestone completed, we must have obtained easements or other written rights of access to a majority of the land that we believe is necessary for the construction and operation of the windpark.  Transmission Interconnection Study. For us to consider this milestone completed, we must have identified a point of interconnection to the transmission system, obtained a queue position and commenced or completed a system impact study. A system impact study and its approval by the relevant transmission system operator is a prerequisite to the design and construction of the facilities that will interconnect the windpark with the transmission system.  Meteorological Data. For us to consider this milestone completed, we must have reviewed existing wind information, installed one or more measurement towers on site, developed a site plan, evaluated all of these data and made an estimate of project energy output that we believe is acceptable for a viable windpark.  Turbine Supply Secured. For us to consider this milestone completed, we must have entered into a written agreement that secures the turbines necessary for the windpark. Typically, turbine suppliers will only contract for turbines approximately two years in advance of their scheduled delivery date.  Environmental Impact Study and Permitting. In most of the states where we develop windparks, completion of an environmental impact study, or EIS, is a prerequisite to obtaining the key permits necessary for the construction and operation of our project. We generally initiate the studies needed for an EIS approximately 18 months prior to the anticipated construction start date and receive the material permits shortly before financing close and start of construction. For us to consider this milestone completed, we will have either finished an EIS or received the material permits for the construction and operation of our windpark. In our view, when all of these milestones and development criteria have been met, it is likely that the windpark will be able to meet the conditions necessary to obtain project financing and ultimately be constructed and commence operations. This development process typically spans two to three years. 84 The following chart sets forth our windparks in operation, in-construction and in-development and indicates the market characteristics that exist and the key development criteria that have been met for each windpark: Windpark Characteristics Location and Capacity Market Characteristics Development Criteria State ISO Capacity (MW) Liquid Energy Market REC Market Capacity Market Land Control Transmission Study Commenced or Completed Met Data Available Turbines Secured EIS / Permits Initial New York Windparks Bliss NY NYISO 100.5 ü ü ü Clinton NY NYISO 100.5 ü ü ü Operational Windparks Ellenburg NY NYISO 81.0 ü ü ü Capacity Subtotal 282.0 2008 Windparks Altona NY NYISO 97.5 ü ü ü ü ü ü ü ü Bellmont NY NYISO 21.0 ü ü ü ü ü ü ü ü Chateaugay NY NYISO 106.5 ü ü ü ü ü ü ü ü Wethersfield NY NYISO 126.0 ü ü ü ü ü ü ü ü Great Plains I TX SPP 114.0 ü ü  ü ü ü ü ü Capacity Subtotal 465.0 2009 Windparks Ball Hill/Villanova NY NYISO 100.5 ü ü ü ü ü ü ü  Centerville/Rushford NY NYISO 100.5 ü ü ü ü ü ü ü  Chateaugay II NY NYISO 19.5 ü ü ü ü ü ü ü  Great Plains II TX SPP 126.0 ü ü  ü ü ü ü ü Mitchell County I (Phase I) TX ERCOT 153.0 ü ü  ü ü ü ü  Capacity Subtotal 499.5 2010 Windparks Burke NY NYISO 60.0 ü ü ü ü ü ü   Farmersville NY NYISO 100.5 ü ü ü   ü   Mitchell County I (Phase II) TX ERCOT 147.0 ü ü  ü ü ü   Mitchell County II TX ERCOT 150.0 ü ü  ü ü ü   Grandpa's Knob VT ISONE 72.0 ü ü ü ü  ü   Granite Reliable NH ISONE 75.0 ü ü ü  ü ü   Flat Hill I MN MISO 100.5 ü ü  ü  ü   Expected Capacity Subtotal 705.0 Expected Total Capacity through 2010 1,951.5 2011/2012 Windparks Expansion of existing windparks 800.0 New windparks in existing states 550.0 Windparks in new states 550.0 Estimated Capacity Subtotal 1,900.0 Expected Total Capacity through 2012 3,851.5 85 Projects in Development for 2011-2012 We have identified 1,900 MW of windpark projects that we expect will commence operations in 2011 and 2012. Of this amount, we expect a geographic distribution of projects as shown below: State Estimated Capacity (MW) Maine 50 Michigan 400 Minnesota 200 New York 175 Texas 800 Vermont 175 Wyoming 100 Total 1,900 The windparks in Minnesota, New York, Texas and Vermont will represent additional operations or expansions of the windparks that we expect to have in operation in these states by 2010. The windparks in Maine, Michigan and Wyoming represent new states being added to our project portfolio, although we have significant experience with the energy markets and regulatory environment in Michigan as a result of our prior development activities in that state. For the majority of these projects, we have secured a portion of the land necessary to place our turbines and have analyzed the characteristics of the applicable energy, capacity and REC markets. We have also performed preliminary wind analysis, started discussions concerning the interconnection process and initiated a dialogue with the local communities. The development of these projects, however, is still subject to many of the risks described in "Risk Factors," which may cause delays or in some cases, termination of the project. Our project development group continuously explores opportunities to add new windparks to our portfolio. We expect that these project development efforts will result in a 4,000 MW development pipeline of projects which could be constructed after 2012, adding to the 3,850 MW portfolio that we expect to have in operation at the end of 2012. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that the following strengths position us to profitably grow our windpark portfolio in the rapidly developing U.S. wind energy market:  High-quality portfolio of operating, in-construction and in-development windparks located in attractive U.S. energy markets;  Fully integrated in-house capabilities to develop, finance, construct, own and operate windparks and to support the continuing growth of our portfolio;  Experienced and proven management team with an average of more than 20 years of experience with complex power projects;  Strong relationships with major turbine suppliers and all of the turbines secured to support our projects slated for construction through 2009; and  Substantial local presence and community stakeholder involvement in the markets in which we are active. 86 High-quality portfolio of operating, in-construction and in-development windparks located in attractive U.S. energy markets We believe that our strategically located portfolio of operating, in-construction and in-development windparks ideally positions us within the rapidly growing U.S. wind energy market. We currently have projects representing 282 MW of capacity in operation in New York. Later in 2008, we expect to commence operations in Texas and bring further New York projects online, representing an aggregate addition of 465 MW of capacity. In 2009, we expect to bring further New York and Texas projects online, representing an aggregate addition of 500 MW of capacity. In 2010, we expect to commence operations in New England (New Hampshire and Vermont) and Minnesota, as well as bring further New York and Texas projects online, representing an aggregate addition of 705 MW of capacity. By the end of 2012, we expect to have operational projects representing 3,850 MW of capacity in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Texas, Vermont and Wyoming. As indicated in the discussion of our windpark portfolio above, we have already completed substantial milestones for our projects targeted for completion through 2010. In addition, we believe that our development portfolio will give us significant scale across a geographically diverse national footprint. We carefully select our project sites to ensure that they are in regions characterized by acceptable wind resources, high power prices in deregulated energy markets and favorable renewable energy policies. We believe our management's experience in developing windparks in new markets and adding projects in our existing markets will enable us to continue to successfully expand our development portfolio. Additionally, we believe our management's understanding of deregulated energy markets enables us to maximize the value of our development portfolio. We devote considerable resources to structuring and assembling our project portfolio to achieve disciplined growth in the regions that we believe offer the most economically attractive returns. Fully integrated in-house capabilities to develop, finance, construct, own and operate windparks and to support the continuing growth of our portfolio Our fully integrated, cross-functional organizational structure enables us to develop, finance, construct, own and operate each of our projects with a long-term ownership perspective. Our commodities and risk management team works closely with our developers and meteorological team on identifying regions for optimal project development. Collaboration among the developers, engineers and managers on each of our projects allows us to transition from one stage to the next and to regularly identify process and technical improvements over the life-cycle of each project. This integrated project management strategy enables us to continuously improve the development timing, cost and capital structure and revenue optimization of projects across our portfolio. Additionally, our management team has extensive project finance and commodity hedging expertise, allowing us to optimize our capital structure and reduce the impact of spot market price volatility. At our windparks, we have staff from the development, legal, construction, operations and asset management disciplines. Our fully integrated approach can provide us significant operational flexibility, a high level of quality control and the ability to manage costs and make decisions quickly and efficiently. For example:  during the construction period of the Initial New York Windparks, when we had to change the path of a collection line (a cable that connects the turbines to the substation), our development team worked with the affected landowners, while the onsite environmental team assessed any potential impact on existing permits and the construction team gave real-time input as to the feasibility of alternate routes;  our operators were involved in the commissioning of the turbines at our Initial New York Windparks and will operate them throughout their life, including during the initial warranty period provided by GE under the turbine supply agreements. This familiarity with our assets has 87 enabled the operating team to develop a tailored preventative maintenance program and smoothly integrate with the asset management and commodities groups to maximize the revenues from these windparks; and  at our Initial New York Windparks, we acted as the general contractor for the construction process and we have served as the operator since the Initial New York Windparks were commissioned. We believe that these efforts have enabled us to save the mark-up that we would have incurred if third parties had provided these services. These arrangements also gave us significantly more flexibility to make changes in the construction scope and timetable (which may have resulted in penalties if we had used a third-party general contractor). Experienced management team with an average of more than 20 years of experience with complex power projects Our management team has extensive knowledge of every aspect of the development, financing, construction and operation of windparks, as well as many years of experience in traditional independent electricity generation. Our senior management has an average of over 20 years of experience and involvement in bringing domestic and international power projects online, from initial development through financing to ongoing operations and maintenance, and have devoted their careers to the power and wind industries. They have formerly held leadership positions at many national and international power companies, including GE, FPL Energy, Public Service Enterprise Group, U.S. Generating Company, Kenetech, Enron, Vestas American Wind Technology and Sempra Energy. Additionally, members of our finance team have held leadership positions raising project financing for or providing investment banking services to the power sector at JPMorgan Chase, HSBC Securities, Wachovia Securities and Société Générale. We also have significant experience in our E&C and O&M functions. Our senior construction team includes personnel who have supervised the design and construction of power facilities in excess of 5,400 MW over the last ten years. Additionally, our senior operations team has been responsible for the operation of windparks in excess of 2,100 MW over the last ten years. Strong relationships with major turbine suppliers and all of the turbines secured to support our projects slated for construction through 2009 Access to wind turbines is a crucial factor in the ability of wind energy developers to build out their pipeline of projects. As a result of the rapid growth in the wind energy industry, developers are facing increased competition in procuring wind turbines. In order to address this issue, we have built strong relationships with major turbine suppliers and have successfully secured all of the turbines needed to support our projects slated for construction through 2009. Our exclusive turbine supplier to date has been General Electric. With over 6,500 GE 1.5 MW wind turbines installed worldwide, GE turbines have an established track record and a solid history of reliability. Each of our operating technicians undergoes an intense training program at the GE Wind Training Center to standardize maintenance practices and minimize variability of our maintenance procedures among our windparks. In addition to GE, we maintain an active dialogue with another turbine supplier, as well as with the suppliers of spare parts for our turbines. As we continue to grow our portfolio, we believe that our strong relationships, scale and purchasing power will enable us to continue to secure the turbines and related spare parts necessary to support our growth on favorable terms with respect to payment, pricing and flexibility. Substantial local presence and community stakeholder involvement in the markets in which we are active We maintain permanently staffed project offices in Altona, Arcade, Bliss, Churubusco and Fredonia, New York; Austin and Hitchland, Texas; Lancaster, New Hampshire; Ubly, Michigan and 88 Rutland, Vermont. By maintaining these offices and becoming involved in local community affairs, we develop a meaningful local presence, which we believe provides us with a significant advantage when navigating the local permitting processes and helps to enlist the support of the local communities for our projects. When we identify a new project, our developers move to that local area and integrate themselves into the community by attending public meetings. In this way, the local community recognizes that we are committed to making positive contributions to the area. Additionally, our involvement in the area helps to generate support from key local stakeholders such as significant landowners, local political bodies and business leaders. We believe that our community based approach has enabled us to secure approvals and support for our projects in regions that have historically voiced meaningful opposition and has given us a significant advantage over competitors who are not as active in the local communities. Business Growth Strategy We intend to implement the following strategies to profitably grow our windpark portfolio in the rapidly developing U.S. wind energy market:  Focus development of wind capacity in attractive deregulated and geographically diverse energy markets;  Enter regional markets in scale, primarily through organic development;  Extract the efficiency benefits of our fully integrated business model;  Manage commodity price risk while retaining potential energy value;  Utilize debt and tax equity finance structures;  Create relationships as a community stakeholder; and  Attract, train and retain top talent. Focus development of wind capacity in attractive deregulated and geographically diverse energy markets We seek to develop windparks within geographically diverse, established and deregulated energy markets that have attractive energy pricing, strong RPS programs and, in many cases, capacity payments. In implementing this strategy, we have initially focused on New York, Texas, New England and a limited number of other states, which meet this criteria. We intend to expand our operating wind generation portfolio by entering into new markets, while simultaneously adding projects adjacent to our existing projects. We believe that this carefully designed expansion plan will allow us to effectively leverage our existing resources while seeking development opportunities in new markets. We seek to develop our projects in markets with attractive pricing dynamics, as indicated by tightening supply and low or declining reserve margins. A reserve margin is a measure (expressed as a percentage) of the available capacity that is expected to exceed forecasted peak demand across a region. A decline in reserve margins indicates a reduction in the supply of capacity relative to peak demand. This increasing scarcity of capacity and transmission constraints is likely to put upward pressure on both energy prices and capacity payments. Regulatory or administrative bodies typically set targets or requirements for reserve margins. For instance, the New York State Reliability Council set reserve margins for New York at 16.5% and ERCOT, the system operator in Texas, set a minimum reserve margin of 12.5%. Additionally, according to the Energy Information Administration, the vast majority of regions in which we intend to grow our project portfolio have experienced declining reserve margins since 2004. From 2004 to 2006, the average reserve margin in the contiguous United States declined from 26% to 19%, with continued 89 declines forecasted through 2011. The following table summarizes the significant characteristics of the energy markets in which we intend to develop and operate windparks.

Enter regional markets in scale, primarily through organic development Upon entering a market, we seek to become a leading wind energy operator and an influential voice within the region. We believe that our large scale projects will enable us to take full advantage of the benefits of our local presence and spread our fixed infrastructure and operating costs over a large number of turbines. While we may opportunistically acquire existing or partially developed windparks, we expect to grow our portfolio primarily through organic development, which means developing each project in-house, from initial site selection through construction and operation. We believe that this approach will allow us to execute a deliberate expansion plan for growth without relying on acquisitions. We believe that our organic development model is generally preferable to acquiring projects because of the time and risk related to finalizing development on a third party's project and the premium these opportunities attract in the current competitive market. Extract the efficiency benefits of our fully integrated business model We seek to maximize project efficiency and reduce costs by taking advantage of our in-house capabilities in development, financing, construction and operations. For example, in the construction phase, we believe our ability to choose between using outside providers or taking advantage of our in-house capability to act as a general contractor gives us significant flexibility. Additionally, we will maintain a central warehouse of spare parts, which we believe will result in significant benefits, 90 including increased operational flexibility as we will not have to delay maintenance as a result of waiting for an item with a long-lead time to arrive. As our asset base grows, we believe we will achieve further cost reductions due to economies of scale in maintaining our windparks and purchasing components. Manage commodity price risk while retaining potential energy value We have implemented and expect to continue to implement financial hedges with respect to the majority of the energy we produce. The effect of these hedges is to help stabilize our revenue stream by reducing the impact of regional energy spot market price volatility. We forgo some of the potential benefit of increases in future energy prices by receiving the fixed price from the hedge counterparty rather than the floating price we would otherwise receive from the market. However, our hedging arrangements are designed to protect us against the risk of decreases in energy rates. This benefits both us and our lenders by strengthening our ability to provide sufficient debt service coverage and as a result greatly enhances our ability to obtain debt financing on attractive terms. We can still benefit from future increases in energy prices through the unhedged portion of our energy production both in the early years of the project's life (as the actual energy volume generated by the projects is expected to be greater, on average, than the hedged volume) and in the time after the hedging arrangement expires. Furthermore, our strategy of entering into hedges around the time of the closing of financing for a windpark as opposed to pursuing power purchase agreements, or PPAs, allows us to potentially benefit from future energy price movements and avoid the cost and price competition involved in bidding on PPAs. Additionally, our current arrangements incorporate the concept of a "tracking account" that effectively defers some or all of the risks associated with the variability in our energy production volume until later in the project's operational life when the project debt has been significantly amortized. The tracking account essentially transfers the credit risk of this deferral to the hedge counterparty. For further discussion of our hedging strategy, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRevenues." Utilize debt and tax equity finance structures In our selection of the various financing alternatives generally available to wind energy developers, we seek to maximize the rate of return on our project investments and monetize the tax benefits that we currently cannot utilize due to our lack of taxable income. We attempt to finance substantially all of our turbine purchases with debt secured primarily by the turbines themselves in order to increase our flexibility with respect to the specific projects in which turbines will be placed. We also use construction and project debt financing to minimize recourse against the issuer while optimizing our use of third-party capital. Finally, we will use tax equity financing arrangements in order to monetize the value generated by PTCs and accelerated tax depreciation that are available to us as a wind energy generator. We will be able to enter into these arrangements at a cost of capital that reflects the tax equity investor's ability to utilize these tax benefits. Until we have significant taxable income, we intend to continue financing our windparks with tax equity financing structures so long as tax incentives and tax equity investors remain available. Create relationships as a community stakeholder As part of our development strategy, we aim to create strong community relationships that we believe are critical to securing the land necessary for our windparks. Our team works closely with the landowners who will host the windpark to ensure that they fully understand the impact of having turbines on their property. Throughout the process, we assess and monitor the landowners' and broader community's receptiveness and willingness to host a windpark, while providing a program to educate the communities on the benefits of having a windpark in their area. This proactive involvement in the community also enables us to submit permit applications that are tailored to address local concerns. 91 Attract, train and retain top talent As we continue to grow our business and add new windparks to our portfolio, we will need to attract, train and retain additional employees. We believe that our collaborative culture, fully integrated management model and internal human resource development abilities are critical to attracting new and experienced talent and retaining key team members, such as our engineers, developers and meteorology experts. We provide extensive training, and we believe that we offer attractive employment opportunities in the markets in which we operate. In addition, as part of our retention strategy, we will be issuing equity incentive awards to certain key members of our team in connection with this offering. Organization of Our Business Our business is organized around the projects in our portfolio. There are four key functional stages associated with developing and operating a windpark: (i) development, (ii) financing and commodity risk management, (iii) engineering and construction and (iv) operations and maintenance. Development Site Selection, Land Control and Permitting Our development professionals select areas for development, first by evaluating regional energy, REC and capacity market characteristics, wind resources and land use patterns, and then by screening specific candidate sites for transmission availability, interconnection options, environmental sensitivity, local community receptivity and the potential for organized opposition. In performing this screening, we use both advanced technology and human capital to fully investigate and understand the factors that will affect our ability to permit and develop a project with attractive financial potential. Once a suitable site is located, the development phase begins with the identification, selection and securing of the land area required for the windpark. Developers work one-on-one with the landowner or landowners to obtain access and control over the real estate needed to support the windpark and transmission facilities. We memorialize our agreements with landowners through easements and leasing arrangements, which generally provide for a nominal rent payment over the remaining development 92 and construction periods and increased payments when the windpark is operational. The majority of those payments are based on the performance of the windpark once operational. Early in the development cycle, prior to the finalization of a windpark's design, we also begin the environmental impact evaluation process. This entails extensive field work to identify environmental concerns that may impact the issuance of a permit for construction and project layout, such as the presence of endangered species, valuable wetlands or protected scenic views. At all the stages of the development process, we believe that it is important for members of our development team to live in and become active members of the communities in which they work. This approach gives our staff the opportunity to develop relationships with members of the community and educate them about the benefits of our projects, which we believe reduces the chance of community opposition. Strong relationships with community members also enable our developers to identify local issues of concern and address these in the project designs. The local team also works closely with our environmental and legal groups to ensure that the projects can be efficiently permitted. In addition, our public affairs group conducts community outreach in the local area near the proposed windpark and helps to communicate information about wind energy, windparks and our long-term commitment to the host communities. Once a windpark is operational, we continue to maintain a local presence at the site to retain the support of the community and address concerns in a timely fashion. With a long-term vision for development, we understand the importance of maintaining a continuous dialogue with all stakeholders who may be involved in our current and future projects. Wind/Meteorological Analysis A key factor in the success of any windpark is the profile and predictability of the wind resources at the site. Extensive studies of historical weather and wind patterns have been performed across North America and many resources, in the forms of charts, graphs and maps, are available to wind developers. The most attractive windpark sites offer a combination of land accessibility, power transmission, proximity to construction resources and favorable and dependable winds. When wind energy developers identify promising sites, they perform detailed studies to provide greater certainty with respect to the long-term wind characteristics at the site and to identify the most effective turbine siting strategy. The long-term annual output of a windpark is assessed through the use of on-site wind data, publicly available reference data and sophisticated software. Wind speeds are estimated in great detail for specific months, including intra-day variations, and are then correlated to turbine manufacturers' specifications to identify the most efficient turbine for the site. Today's wind turbines can efficiently generate electricity when the wind speed is between 11 and 55 miles per hour. Additional calculations and adjustments to determine turbine availability (which is principally affected by planned and unplanned maintenance events), wake effects (wind depletion caused by turbines sited upwind), blade soiling and icing and other factors are made to arrive at an estimate of the net capacity factor. A windpark's net capacity factor is the percentage represented by the energy output in MWh measured at the revenue meter over a period of time, divided by the product of the capacity of the windpark in MW multiplied by the number of hours in the measurement period. For example, if a 100 MW windpark generates 306,600 MWh in one year (8,760 hours), the net capacity factor equals 35%. We have an in-house wind technologies team, including three professionals with graduate degrees in meteorology who provide support at each stage of the development and construction processes and during ongoing operations. Our in-house scientists work closely with several leading subcontractors to develop statistical modeling, data quality assurance and sophisticated programs to measure wind characteristics at turbine hub-height and above. We also research wind characteristics over the entire wind turbine rotor disk (the diameter of the spinning blades). Finally, our meteorological team 93 investigates climate variability. This research often leads to improvements in our routine wind energy assessment program. Our wind program starts with prospecting for windy sites over a wide area by using public wind maps or maps that we commission. These maps are generated with sophisticated statistical models, which use global climatic data and detailed local terrain characteristics, and identify the most attractive land for a windpark in a specific region. Once our development team secures access to a portion of the targeted land, we begin a field program by establishing a long-term reference 60-meter instrumented tower. This field test is followed by the installation of numerous additional towers that probe the wind resources across the entire prospective site plan. Depending on site specific issues, we may do additional studies with hub-height fixed towers or SODAR, which is a remote sensing technology that measures winds up to a height of 200 meters without the need for a tower. Our in-house experts also use statistical models for siting wind turbines within a windpark in conjunction with our field environmental team. Together, these teams determine areas where wind turbines cannot be located due to environmental, zoning, turbine-related or other restrictions. This modeling enables us to adjust site plans very quickly, which substantially shortens our development and engineering cycles. We and our consultants prepare estimates of the long-term energy production capability of each project, as well as the short-term energy variability characteristics, while adhering to a rigorous quality assurance program to ensure the quality of the wind data required by our commodity hedge counterparties and lenders. These energy estimates are continuously improved as data is collected. Prior to obtaining project financing, we submit our data and analyses for review by independent wind consultants. Transmission Interconnection Transmission interconnection is one of the key elements of windpark development as it ensures connectivity and access to power markets. We seek to identify the most cost effective point of interconnection to the regional power grid while not compromising the reliability and security of the transmission network or market access. The first step in the interconnection process is filing an interconnection application with the regional independent system operator, or RTO. The ISO then coordinates with us to complete three consecutive studies: a feasibility study, a system impact study and a facilities study. The objective of the feasibility study is to determine whether there is adequate transmission resource sufficiently close to the proposed windpark. The goal of the system impact study is to evaluate the impact of the proposed windpark on the transmission network, while the facilities study determines the required physical interconnection facilities and any network upgrades along with the costs associated with such requirements. In aggregate, these studies generally take nine to twelve months to complete; however, this timeline can change from ISO to ISO, depending on the number of proposed projects in the ISO's interconnection applications queue. In addition, if we fail to meet the study process milestones set by the rules, we may lose our position in the transmission planning queue, with the possible result that our windparks may be required to restart the study process. At the conclusion and acceptance of the facilities study, we negotiate an interconnection agreement with the ISO and the transmission owner. This agreement defines the cost allocation and schedule for interconnection and upgrades as well as outlines the facilities' ownership and operation. In certain cases, where an agreement for an interconnection agreement with the transmission owner and or/operator is not reached after 60 days of negotiation, we can request that the transmission owner and/or operator submit an unexecuted interconnection agreement to FERC. The transmission interconnection process, from the start of the studies through the filing of the interconnection agreement, can take up to two years or more to complete. 94 Financing and Commodities Risk Management We have established two groups responsible for executing our windpark financing and commodity risk management strategies. Our financing and commodities risk management groups work closely together to ensure that our projects can be economically financed in a timely manner and to manage our exposure to and maximize our potential upside from volatility in the energy markets. These two groups are charged with implementing and managing the financing structures that we use to fund our windparks' development, construction and operations, executing our electricity hedging strategy and managing our energy, capacity and REC sales. Turbine Financing We fund the cash required to pay for turbines purchased under our turbine supply agreements through borrowings by certain of our subsidiaries under turbine credit facilities. We currently have in place a first lien revolving turbine credit facility and a second lien turbine credit facility. These facilities allow us to finance between 60% and 100% of our turbine purchases with debt. These facilities are secured by, among other things, turbines not yet transferred to a project subsidiary for use in a particular windpark. By not transferring turbines specifically to the owners of our windparks and not pledging all general project assets as collateral, we maintain the ability to purchase turbines in advance of project development and construction, which provides us with a large degree of flexibility regarding the specific windparks in which turbines will be ultimately placed. For a further discussion of the first and second lien turbine credit facilities, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationLiquidity and Capital Resources" and "Description of Certain Financing ArrangementsSenior Secured Turbine Credit Facilities." Commodity Risk Management We view the understanding of, and participation in, the energy commodity markets as an integral component required for success in the U.S. wind energy industry. Our commodity risk management team designs and implements energy hedging structures to help manage energy commodity price risk and production volume fluctuation risk. Our energy hedging arrangements enable us to effectively transfer energy price risk to our hedging counterparty with respect to a portion of the energy generated at our windparks. These arrangements protect us from volatility in the energy markets and are essential tools in helping us to arrange financing for the construction of our windparks. For further discussion of our hedging strategy, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRevenues." Project Financing The project finance team structures and negotiates debt and tax equity financings for the construction and operation of our projects, with the goal of minimizing recourse and maximizing our after-tax financial returns, while also preserving our managerial control over the project companies. In support of these activities, the project finance team maintains close relationships with active renewable energy lenders and potential tax equity investors. Debt Financing. Debt for windparks is typically provided by commercial banks and institutional lenders that have the expertise to evaluate the risks associated with the technology, construction, operations and wind resources necessary for windparks. These lenders provide construction financing for most sizable industrial and infrastructure projects. After construction of a windpark has been completed, these banks often remain as lenders at the project level. 95 Project financing options have improved substantially as the market has matured over recent years. Wind technology and project fundamentals are now widely understood by project finance lenders and U.S. institutional investors. According to Project Finance International, the wind sector received 56% of the $35.0 billion of renewable technology project financing issued from 2000 to 2006. For further discussion of our project debt financing arrangements, see "Description of Certain Financing ArrangementsInitial New York Project Financing." Tax Equity Financing. U.S. windparks are currently supported by the ten-year PTC and five-year accelerated tax depreciation. While the PTC can be applied to reduce federal income tax liabilities on a dollar-for-dollar basis and accelerated depreciation can reduce taxable income or generate tax losses, we, like many wind energy companies, do not currently have the taxable income necessary to use these tax benefits. Accordingly, as part of the financing strategy for our windparks, we seek to monetize the value of these tax benefits by entering into investment structures with tax equity investors, who can utilize the benefits. Typically, we will form a limited liability company with the tax investors, who will be allocated most of the tax benefits and will receive significant cash distributions during the ten-year PTC period. Typical tax equity investors include large financial institutions, such as banks or insurance companies, utilities or other institutional investors with relatively low funding costs and significant income against which they could apply the tax benefits generated by our windparks. We expect that increasing numbers of participants will be willing to provide tax equity financing in the future, so long as the tax incentives remain available. For example, according to JP Morgan Capital Corporation, in 2006, $3.1 billion in tax equity was raised. For a further discussion of our tax equity financing structures, and the tax equity financing related to our Initial New York Windparks, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationLiquidity and Capital ResourcesRefinancing Upon Commencement of Operations and Tax Equity Financing" and "Risk FactorsThe federal government may not extend or may decrease tax incentives for renewable energy, including wind energy, which would have an adverse impact on our development strategy." Engineering and Construction (E&C) As part of our strategy to fully integrate our capabilities across all aspects of windpark development, financing, construction and operations, we have an in-house team of 43 E&C professionals who perform engineering and construction services for many of our projects. Our engineering and construction team has the ability to either act as general contractor on a project, coordinating with third-party construction contractors, or to engage a third-party in the general contractor or construction management role. We make these decisions based on economic benefit to us. We believe that this two-fold construction strategy differentiates us from other independent U.S. wind energy companies, which typically rely only upon third-party general contractors. Our E&C team is comprised of highly experienced project and construction managers, superintendents, field engineers, safety technicians, quality specialists and project control engineers and includes personnel who have supervised the design and construction of power facilities in excess of 5,400 MW over the last ten years. Where we act as general contractor, each project site has a dedicated resident construction manager and team of construction professionals and engineers. Other E&C functions are centralized, which allows the group to efficiently scale its resources to support our developing national platform and growth capabilities. In general, we provide E&C services pursuant to contracts between our E&C subsidiary and each project subsidiary. Our E&C team also works closely with our development teams to provide input throughout the development cycle from land acquisition through permitting and financing of our windparks. We provide a highly responsive and flexible approach to resolving any issues that arise during the 96 development of a project. Immediate access to engineering and construction expertise enhances our ability to make practical, cost effective decisions during the development cycle. Additionally, the close co-ordination of our development and E&C teams ensures that our construction designs are compatible with permits and landowner agreements to minimize any problems during the construction phase and ensure a timely start of construction. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) We perform O&M services in-house through our experienced and well-trained team of 25 professionals, who have been responsible for the operation of windparks in excess of 2,100 MW over the last ten years. Our O&M department closely monitors the performance of the equipment at our windparks to prevent and minimize downtime. This constant feedback offers managers an effective and timely method to measure their performance and identify areas for improvement and allows us to take preventative action rather than simply reacting to problems. We also use problem-solving tools designed to determine the root cause of problems and to continuously improve quality and maximize run time. We have also established a National Operations Center, which allows us to remotely monitor and control, if necessary, each of our turbines from a central location. We have installed equipment that allows us to combine historical trend analysis with real-time operational data to predict possible turbine performance issues. We also employ predictive maintenance techniques, including borescopic visual analysis that tracks the performances of gear boxes, main bearings and generators, as well as infrared camera analysis, which monitors the effectiveness of transformers, collection system connections and control panels. In addition, our meteorology group works closely with our National Operations Center to provide forecast information in support of power scheduling and for windpark performance assessment, which will aid in the scheduling of preventative maintenance services. These predictive tools allow us to perform scheduled repairs instead of reacting to expensive unexpected problems, which we believe helps us reduce the more than 70% of our O&M expenses related to labor and component usage. Through our equipment subsidiary, we also intend to carry key spare wind turbine parts at our National Operations Center, which we believe will result in significant reductions in costs and turbine downtime by enabling us to procure long lead-time components before engaging sub-contractors. Our O&M team is easily scalable to meet our growth needs. It works closely with GE, our current turbine supplier, to identify and remedy any turbine component failures as our turbine supply agreements with GE provide us with a two-year warranty on all wind turbine components. We currently have 13 technicians, each of whom has or will undergo an intense training program at the GE Wind Training Center to learn standardized maintenance practices and optimal turbine operation procedures, which minimizes the variability of our maintenance procedures and troubleshooting techniques among our windparks. As we continue to grow our operating portfolio, we plan to expand our O&M team, placing an emphasis on hiring personnel from the local communities in which we operate. As with E&C services, we generally provide O&M services pursuant to contracts between our O&M subsidiary and each project subsidiary. Similarly, while we generally intend to operate and maintain our windparks ourselves, we retain the flexibility to use third-party service providers. This also differentiates us from other independent U.S. wind energy companies. Asset Management We have adopted a commercial strategy of managing our projects and other assets with an in-house asset management team of 11 professionals acting as "owner's representatives." The role of the asset management group is to manage each individual windpark by overseeing the E&C, O&M and parts supply contracts and to closely monitor the performance of each windpark from an owner's point of view in order to maximize financial performance and minimize risk. With a group of seasoned managers from the wind and independent power sectors, our asset management team optimizes the commercial performance of our assets, services the project debt, manages project agreements and 97 compliance and has ultimate responsibility for the financial performance of each project. The team also manages our extensive real estate obligations, which currently include approximately 700 individual easements for 26 projects, as well as our corporate insurance program, municipal obligations, home office, remote facilities and mobile assets. Our asset management team is scalable and organized regionally in order to facilitate a seamless transfer of responsibilities from the development team through construction to commercial operations. Accounting, Legal and Human Resources We have developed sophisticated support capabilities in these critical areas through our team of 19 professionals. Our accounting group is responsible for the preparation of our financial statements and related financial reports. The legal group provides direct support to our project development team at all phases of siting and construction and counsels the company and its board of directors on compliance matters. The human resources function oversees all employment policies and procedures, implements recruiting and training and supports our growth. Our Projects We currently have three windparks in operation in New York with a capacity of 282 MW.  The Noble Bliss Windpark is located in the rolling hills of western New York, within Wyoming County.

This 21.0 MW project is expected to consist of 14 GE 1.5 MW sle turbines. In 2009, we plan to construct three additional windparks in New York, the remaining MW at the Great Plains project and one additional windpark in Texas, adding 499.5 MW of capacity to our operating portfolio.  The Noble Ball Hill/Villenova Windpark will be located in the hills of western New York, within Chautauqua County. This 100.5 MW project is expected to consist of 67 GE 1.5 MW sle turbines. 98  The Noble Centerville/Rushford Windpark will be located in the hills of western New York, within Allegany County. This 100.5 MW project is expected to consist of 67 GE 1.5 MW sle turbines.  The Noble Chateaugay II Windpark will be located contiguous to the Noble Chateaugay Windpark. This 19.5 MW project is expected to consist of 13 GE 1.5 MW sle turbines.  The Noble Mitchell County I Windpark will be located in the open ranch land of western Texas, within Mitchell County. This 300 MW project, 153 MW (Phase I) of which will be constructed in 2009 and 147 MW (Phase II) of which will be constructed in 2010, is expected to consist of 200 GE 1.5 MW sle turbines. In 2010, we plan to construct two additional windparks in New York, the remaining MW at the Mitchell County I project and one additional windpark in Texas, two new windparks in New England and one new windpark in Minnesota, adding 705 MW of capacity to our operating portfolio.  The Noble Burke Windpark will be located adjacent to the Noble Chateaugay and Bellmont Windparks.

This 100.5 MW project is expected to consist of 67 GE 1.5 MW sle turbines. We have identified an estimated 1,900 MW of additional windparks that we expect to commence operations in 2011 and 2012. Of this amount, we expect that approximately 50 MW will be located in Maine, 400 MW will be located in Michigan, 200 MW will be located in Minnesota, 175 MW will be located in New York, 800 MW will be located in Texas, 175 MW will be located in Vermont and 100 MW will be located in Wyoming. The windparks in Minnesota, New York, Texas and Vermont will represent additional operations or expansions of our windparks that we expect to be in operation in those states by 2010. The windparks in Maine, Michigan and Wyoming represent new states in our project portfolio. For the majority of these windparks, we have secured a portion of the land necessary to place our turbines and have analyzed the characteristics of the applicable energy, capacity and REC markets. We have also performed preliminary wind analysis, started discussions related to the interconnection process and initiated a dialogue with the local communities. Competition We compete with other renewable energy companies, but principally with those companies in the wind energy industry, including public utilities that are much larger than we are with substantially greater financial resources. In the wind energy sector, competition occurs primarily during the 99 development phase, principally in the identification and procurement of suitable sites with high wind resources availability, grid connection capacity and the availability of land, wind turbines, spare parts and the other key equipment we depend on to construct and operate our windparks. Depending on the regulatory framework and our approach in certain regions, we may also face competition for long-term power purchase agreements. Additionally, we face competition for the sale of RECs generated by our windparks and for personnel experienced in the wind power industry. Customers We sell the energy generated by, and we expect to sell the capacity of, our windparks into the market operated by NYISO. We have also agreed to sell the majority of the RECs generated through the operation of these windparks to NYSERDA. For more information, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRevenues." We expect that the sale of energy into the market operated by NYISO (net of any gain or loss associated in our energy hedging transactions) and the sale of RECs to NYSERDA will account for approximately 78% and 19%, respectively, of our revenues during 2008. We expect to use similar arrangements with respect to energy, capacity and REC sales with NYISO, NYSERDA and other parties in our future windparks. Each regional wholesale electricity market in which we intend to operate is administered by an Independent System Operator, or ISO, or a Regional Transmission Operator, or RTO, which also operate the electric transmission facilities within a specific state or region. Below is a description of the NYISO, where we currently sell our electricity and capacity, and of the other regional markets in which we intend to sell our electricity and capacity.  The NYISO has been the independent system operator for the New York state transmission system and wholesale electricity markets since 1999. The NYISO consists of 11 different zones or sub-regions which are separated by transmission constraints. The NYISO manages approximately 11,000 miles of transmission lines and more than 300 generation units totaling almost 40,000 MW of capacity. The products that are traded in the NYISO include energy, capacity, and financial transmission rights. Energy markets are comprised of a day-ahead market and a real-time market with pricing based on least-cost bids submitted by electricity generators within each zone. Capacity is sold through a series of auctions for various time periods of the year. Natural gas-fired electric generation sets the market clearing price for electricity for most hours, and summer reserve margins in each of 2005 and 2006 were 17%.  The Southwest Power Pool, or SPP, is an RTO whose territory covers Kansas, Oklahoma and parts of New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas. SPP has 11 load zones and does not currently have a separate capacity market. Market participants trade physical electricity bilaterally, either directly or through brokers, and through the real-time energy imbalance service market. The region is characterized by coal and natural gas on the margin for most hours and had a summer reserve margin of approximately 13-14% during the years 2004 through 2006. Noble expects to build windparks in the parts of Texas located in SPP.  The ISO New England, or ISO-NE, covers several states in the northeastern United States, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and parts of Maine. Load zones and locational pricing are differentiated by state, except for Massachusetts, which is divided into three areas: Northeastern Massachusetts, Southeastern Massachusetts and Western/Central Massachusetts. Similar to NYISO, ISO-NE has separate energy and capacity markets with natural gas-fired electric generation also setting the price of electricity for most hours. These markets include day ahead and real-time spot market with locational marginal pricing. Further, summer reserve margins have declined significantly from 29% in 2004 to 10% in 2006. 100  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, covers most of Texas and is divided into four zones: Houston, North, South and West. Like SPP, ERCOT is an energy-only market, with no separate transactions for capacity. Market participants trade physical electricity bilaterally, either directly or through brokers, and through the energy imbalance service market. The region currently has excess capacity with some generation recently "moth-balled" or decommissioned. However, according to the FERC, reserve margins are nevertheless expected to decline to levels consistent with the target set by ERCOT of 12.5% target in the next two years. Additionally, summer reserve margins have declined from 26% in 2004 to 14% in 2007. Within ERCOT, natural gas-fired electric generation sets the price of electricity for the majority of hours.  The Midwest ISO, or MISO, covers all or most of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and parts of Montana, Missouri, Kentucky and Ohio. MISO is divided into several markets, including Cinergy, First Energy, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. Additionally, MISO is an energy-only market with coal-fired electric generation setting the market clearing price for electricity for most hours. The Midwest ISO administers a two-settlement (day ahead and real-time) energy market known as the Day-2 market that produces hourly locational marginal prices. Summer reserve margins have declined from 22% in 2005 to 18% in 2006. Suppliers The key component for our windparks is wind turbines. Turbine costs generally represent between 55% and 65% of our total windpark capital costs. There are a limited number of turbine suppliers and current demand worldwide for turbines exceeds production capacity. See "Risk FactorsWe currently rely extensively on one of a small number of wind turbine manufacturers." Our turbine supply strategy is largely based on establishing master supply agreements and developing strong relationships with leading turbine suppliers to secure our turbine needs. GE has supplied us with turbines for our Initial New York Windparks totaling 282 MW, and we have contracted with GE for turbines through 2009 totaling an additional 965 MW. Our contract with GE generally covers the production, erection and commissioning phases and includes a warranty period typically of two years, unless otherwise negotiated. In addition to GE, we maintain an active dialogue with another major turbine supplier, as well as with the suppliers of spare parts for our turbines. The suppliers for two of our key spare parts, namely gear boxes and blades, are located outside of North America. See "Risk FactorsSpare parts for wind turbines and key pieces of electrical equipment may be unavailable to us." Our other important suppliers are engineering and construction companies, including suppliers of crane equipment and operators, that are contracted during the development and construction stages to perform certain work for our windparks, including the construction of portions of the required infrastructure. Employees As of May 5, 2008, we had 152 employees, of which 64 are based in our corporate headquarters, 82 are based in our various project offices and 6 are based in our National Operations Center. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees, and we have never experienced any labor dispute, strike or work stoppage. Insurance We maintain business interruption insurance, casualty insurance, including flood and earthquake coverage, primary and excess liability insurance, customary workers' compensation, automobile insurance and such other insurance as is generally carried by companies engaged in a similar business in the same general areas. In addition, at the individual project companies, we maintain builder's "all risk" insurance coverage for each windpark under construction as well as business interruption and operational risk coverage for each windpark in operation. These project company policies are sized on a project-by-project basis. 101 Regulation The following is a summary overview of certain applicable regulations in the United States and should not be considered a full statement of the law or all related issues. Energy Regulation FPA Under the Federal Power Act, or FPA, the FERC has exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and transmission in interstate commerce. The FPA subjects "public utilities" within the meaning of the FPA, among other things, to rate and corporate regulation by FERC. In particular, sellers of electricity at wholesale in interstate commerce and transmitters of electricity in interstate commerce are regulated by FERC with respect to: the review of the terms and conditions of wholesale electricity sales and transmission of electricity; the need to obtain advance approval of certain dispositions of public utility facilities, mergers, purchases of securities of other public utilities, acquisitions of existing generation facilities and changes in upstream ownership interests; the regulation of their borrowing and securities issuances and assumption of liabilities; and the review of interlocking directorates. Future issuances of our equity securities may also be subject to FERC approval under Section 203 of the FPA. FERC has authority under Section 206 of the FPA in certain circumstances to order refunds and, under FPA amendments pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has expanded authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for violations of the FPA. We can offer no assurance that, at some future time, Congress will not change the relevant provisions of the FPA, or that FERC will not change its regulations implementing the requirements of the FPA. Wholesale electricity sellers authorized by FERC to sell at market-based rates may obtain waivers or blanket pre-approvals as to certain of the regulatory requirements of the FPA, including waiver of FERC's accounting regulations and blanket pre-authorization with respect to its regulation of issuances of securities and assumption of liabilities. We can offer no assurance that FERC will not revisit its policies at some future time with the effect of limiting market-based rate authority, regulatory waivers and blanket authorizations. Each of our Initial New York Windparks and certain of our other windparks have been granted market-based rate authority, and as a result, may sell electric energy and capacity at market or otherwise negotiated rates. While our Texas windpark has obtained QF status pursuant to PURPA and FERC's implementing regulations, we anticipate that our Texas windpark will sell electricity at wholesale pursuant to market-based rate tariff on file with FERC, rather than pursuant to a PURPA contract. As a result of the grant of market-based rate authorization by FERC, each of our Initial New York Windparks and our other windparks with market-based rate authorization is subject to regulation by FERC as a "public utility" pursuant to the FPA. FERC's orders that grant market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if FERC subsequently determines that the market-based rate seller can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. FERC may impose various forms of market mitigation measures, including price caps and operating restrictions, where it determines market power may exist and that the public interest requires such potential market power to be mitigated. We are also required to report to FERC any material changes in status that would reflect a departure from the characteristics that FERC relied upon when granting market-based rate authority, make quarterly electronic filings with FERC providing information on sales of electricity and comply with market behavior and manipulation rules. If any of our windparks were to lose its market-based rate authority, it would be required to obtain FERC's acceptance of cost-of-service rate schedules and would become subject to the accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. 102 In addition to direct regulation by FERC, our windparks are subject to rules and terms of participation imposed and administered by various RTOs and ISOs. Although these entities are themselves ultimately regulated by FERC, they can impose rules, restrictions and terms of service on market participants, like our windparks, that can have a material impact on our business. For example, ISOs and RTOs may impose bidding and scheduling rules, both to curb market power and to ensure functioning markets. FERC rules for the establishment, approval and enforcement of Electric Reliability Standards require each of our windparks to register with the North American Electric Reliability Council and the regional Electric Reliability Organization. We are also required to comply with applicable Reliability Standards approved by FERC. PUHCA and PURPA The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, or PUHCA, in relevant part, provides that any entity that owns, controls or holds power to vote 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a "public utility company" (which is defined to include an "electric utility company") or a company that is a "holding company" of a public utility company or public utility holding company, is subject to certain regulations granting FERC, access to books and records and oversight over certain affiliate transactions. State regulatory commissions may in some instances also have access to books and records of holding companies. Entities that are holding companies solely by virtue of their ownership of qualifying facilities, or QFs, and exempt wholesale generators, or EWGs, are exempt from FERC access to books and records under PUHCA. In order to obtain EWG status pursuant to PUHCA, the owner of a generating facility must demonstrate that it is engaged directly, or indirectly through one or more affiliates, and exclusively in the business of owning and/or operating facilities used exclusively for the generation of electricity for sale at wholesale. In order to obtain QF status pursuant to PURPA, a generating facility must qualify as a small power production facility or cogeneration facility that has either filed a self-certification of QF status with, or has received a QF certification order from, FERC. A wind generation facility may qualify as small power production facility QF if it is less than 80 MW. We have received QF status designation from FERC for our Texas windparks. Each of our Initial New York Windparks has filed a self-certification with the FERC that it is an EWG. As a result, under current federal law, we are not subject to regulation as a holding company under PUHCA and will not be subject to this regulation as long as each "public utility company" in which we have an interest is (i) a QF, (ii) an EWG or (iii) subject to another exemption or waiver. State Regulation Some of our windparks are or will be subject to varying degrees of regulation by state public utility commissions, or PUCs. PUCs have historically had broad authority to regulate both the rates charged by, and the financial activities of, electric utilities that sell electricity at retail, and a number of other matters relating to electric utilities, as described below. State laws may also impose certain regulatory and reporting requirements on other owners and operators of generation facilities. Independent power producers are considered to be public utilities in some states and are subject to varying degrees of regulation by PUCs, ranging from a requirement to obtain a "certificate of public convenience and necessity" in order to construct and operate a generating facility, to regulation of organizational, accounting, financial and other corporate matters. While FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates for wholesale sales of electric energy, states may assert jurisdiction over the location and construction of electric generating facilities, and in certain situations, over the issuance of securities and the sale or other transfer of assets by these facilities. In New York, the New York Public Service Commission, or PSC, has asserted only limited authority over generation facilities selling exclusively into the wholesale market. The PSC's regulation 103 of electricity suppliers does not include regulation of the rates that New York generators may charge. However, the PSC requires new generators to obtain operating licenses pursuant to the state Public Service Law, or PSL, and may condition those licenses on the generator's compliance with siting and operating restrictions. Our Initial New York Windparks have received such licenses from the PSC, as have the projects we expect to build in Altona, Bellmont, Chateaugay and Wethersfield, New York. Section 70 of the PSL requires electric corporations, such as our Initial New York Windparks, to obtain approval of the PSC in advance for certain dispositions of their facilities, mergers, purchases of securities of other public utilities and changes in upstream ownership interests. Each of our Initial New York Windparks has obtained a determination from the PSC that it will be subject to "lightened regulation" by the PSC. For lightly regulated electric corporations like the Initial New York Windparks, there is a presumption that no PSC approval will be required under Section 70 of the PSL for the transfer of ownership interests (including transfers of stock) in entities upstream from the Initial New York Windparks, unless there is a potential for harm to the interests of captive utility ratepayers, which is sufficient to override the presumption. For electric corporations owning generators that make wholesale sales of electricity (such as our Initial New York Windparks), the potential for the exercise of market power arising from an upstream transfer would be sufficient to defeat the presumption and trigger Section 70 review. The PSC also regulates borrowing and securities issuances by electric corporations under Section 69 of the PSL. However, Section 69 does not apply to issuances of stock by an upstream owner of an electric corporation, such as the issuer. As in New York, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT, has limited jurisdiction over power generation companies selling exclusively into the wholesale market. The PUCT requires power generators and sellers of RECs to register, and enforces various rules addressing market power, market manipulation, and reliability. The state also has authority to approve certain mergers, consolidations and affiliations involving power generation companies. The power generation company, or PGC, is also required to register with the applicable Electric Reliability Organization for the region. Our planned Noble Great Plains Windpark is located in SPP and the planned Noble Mitchell County Windpark is located in ERCOT. In addition to registering the facility as a resource with SPP and ERCOT, and after the PUCT has certified the PGC facility as a REC generator, the PGC will also need to enter into a REC account agreement and establish a REC account with ERCOT, as the statewide administrator of the REC program. Environmental Regulation Our windpark development activities are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, primarily including environmental impact review requirements and regulations governing the discharge of fill materials into protected wetlands. The impact of these laws and regulations on the development, construction and operation of our windparks is site specific and varies depending upon the location and design of the windpark and the relevant state and local laws and regulations. In New York, for example, the State Environmental Quality Review Act requires us to evaluate the potential environmental impacts caused by our windparks, including assessments of visual and noise impacts, effects on wildlife (primarily birds and bats) and impacts to historical and cultural resources, and to implement measures to mitigate those impacts to the extent practicable. Local laws may also regulate other aspects of our windpark development and operation, by setting limits on the use of local roads, setback requirements and noise standards. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or with other regulatory standards, we may be denied permits that are required for construction or operation or become subject to regulatory enforcement actions. Project opponents frequently use environmental impact review statutes as a basis for mounting legal challenges to the issuance of permits and approvals. Legal challenges or enforcement actions, even if ultimately defeated, 104 can result in substantial delays in the completion of a windpark and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our windparks are designed to have minimal operational impact on the environment. Operation of a windpark does not produce significant wastes, generate air emissions or result in wastewater discharges. While most of our environmental regulatory obligations arise during or prior to the construction stage for some windparks, significant environmental obligations may still exist even after construction is complete. For example, the Initial New York Windparks are obligated to monitor impacts on avian species and to adopt mitigating measures if we detect substantial impacts. In most cases, the precise nature of this potential mitigation is not specified in the windparks' permits. While we do not currently anticipate that any material mitigation efforts will be required, we cannot offer any assurance that the mitigation will not have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may also be required to mitigate for damage to or loss of wetland areas which, in some instances, may not be completed for several years after the windpark is constructed. We do not anticipate that such mitigation efforts will require material expenditures, but any failure to complete such mitigation could result in fines or penalties and make it more difficult for us to procure similar permits for future windparks. Legal Proceedings We do not have any material legal proceedings which are currently pending. From time to time, we and our subsidiaries may be party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. Additionally, although no such claims are currently pending, we or our individual project subsidiaries may be subject to legal proceedings contesting the validity of one or more permits or otherwise challenging our authorization to construct and operate windparks. Properties We lease our corporate offices (approximately 16,000 square feet) at 8 Railroad Avenue, Essex, Connecticut 06426. We also occupy an aggregate of approximately 18,000 square feet of project office space in Altona, Arcade, Bliss, Churubusco and Fredonia, New York; Austin and Hitchland, Texas; Lancaster, New Hampshire and Rutland, Vermont, which we lease in the form of office trailers or existing built out space. Additionally, our National Operations Center is located in a 9,750 square foot leased facility in Plattsburg, New York. We believe that our current facilities are adequate for our operations as currently conducted and if additional facilities are required, that we could obtain them at commercially reasonable prices. We generally do not own the property underlying our windparks. Instead, we usually obtain easements from the landowners that give us the right to install our meteorological equipment, turbines, transmission lines and related equipment and prohibit the landowners from building other structures that would interfere with the operation or maintenance of the windpark. The terms of the easement agreements vary, but usually cover a development period, a construction period, and a 20-year operational period, with our option to extend the operational period for an additional 30 years. Our easement agreements generally obligate us to make payments to the landowner based on revenues to be generated from assets located on the landowner's property. During the construction phase of a particular windpark, we may acquire land for the siting of facilities needed by the transmission system operator to accommodate the windpark; we typically transfer these real estate interests to the transmission system operator once construction of the windpark is complete.

We intend to avail ourselves of the "controlled company" exception under The NASDAQ Stock Market rules which eliminates the requirement that we have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and that we have compensation and nominating committees composed entirely of independent directors, but retains the requirement that we have an audit committee composed entirely of independent directors. Our board of directors currently consists of 7 directors. Within three months following the closing of this offering, our board of directors will consist of directors, including two independent directors designated by the sponsors. We expect to add one additional independent director, also designated by the sponsors, to our board of directors within twelve months after the closing of this offering. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors will be divided into three classes. The members of each class will serve for a staggered, three-year term. Upon the expiration of the term of a class of directors, directors in that class will be elected for additional three-year terms, subject to the sponsors' board designation rights, at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which their term expires. The classes are composed as follows:  will be Class I directors, whose terms will expire at the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders;  will be Class II directors, whose terms will expire at the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders; and  will be Class III directors, whose terms will expire at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of our directors. This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company. If at any time we cease to be a "controlled company" under The NASDAQ Stock Market rules, the board of directors will take all action necessary to comply with the applicable NASDAQ Stock Market rules, including appointing a majority of independent directors to the board and establishing certain committees composed entirely of independent directors within the time required by The NASDAQ Stock Market rules. Committees of the Board of Directors Audit Committee Upon consummation of this offering, our audit committee will consist of Christopher Behrens, Barry Goldstein and John Warner. The board of directors has determined that Mr. Goldstein is an independent director and qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC and under The NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards. Within three months of the closing of this offering, the sponsors will nominate one additional independent director to the audit committee and remove one interested director. Within one year of the closing of this offering, the sponsors will nominate one additional independent director to the audit committee and remove the interested director so that our audit committee will be comprised of three members, all of whom will be independent and financially literate. The principal duties and responsibilities of our audit committee are as follows:  to monitor our financial reporting process and internal control system; 109  to appoint and replace our independent registered public accounting firm from time to time, determine their compensation and other terms of engagement and oversee their work;  to oversee the performance of our internal audit function; and  to oversee our compliance with legal, ethical and regulatory matters. The audit committee will have the power to investigate any matter brought to its attention within the scope of its duties. It will also have the authority to retain counsel and advisors to fulfill its responsibilities and duties. Compensation Committee Upon consummation of this offering, our compensation committee will consist of Christopher Behrens, Walter Howard and Stephen Murray. The principal duties and responsibilities of our compensation committee are as follows:  to provide oversight on the development and implementation of the compensation policies, strategies, plans and programs for our key employees and outside directors and disclosure relating to these matters;  to review and approve the compensation of our chief executive officer and our other executive officers; and  to provide oversight concerning the compensation of our chief executive officer, succession planning, performance of the chief executive officer and related matters. Nominating and Governance Committee Upon consummation of this offering, our nominating and governance committee will consist of Nancy-Ann DeParle, Charles Hinckley and Stephen Murray. The principal duties and responsibilities of the nominating and governance committee will be as follows:  to establish criteria for board and committee membership and recommend to our board of directors proposed nominees for election to the board of directors and for membership on committees of the board of directors; and  to make recommendations to our board of directors regarding board governance matters and practices. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions. These standards are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which addresses the subject areas covered by the SEC's rules, will be posted on our website. Any substantive amendment to, or waiver from, any provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics with respect to any senior executive or financial officer shall be posted on this website. The information contained on our website is not part of this prospectus. 2007 Director Compensation During 2007, our non-employee managers received no cash compensation. We currently do not have a standard compensation program for non-employee managers, except as described in "Certain 110 Relationships and Related TransactionsOther Transactions." However, we plan to evaluate compensation for non-employee directors and may adopt a compensation program in the future. Such a program may include cash as well as equity components. Compensation Discussion and Analysis This section discusses the material elements of compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to our principal executive officer, our principal financial officers and our three other most highly compensated executive officers in 2007. In 2007, Anne Edgley served as our principal financial officer from January 2007 to June 2007. Mr. Lowe, our current principal financial officer, assumed that role in June 2007. These individuals are referred to as our "named executive officers." This discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for 2007 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations regarding compensation programs that we may adopt in the future. The actual compensation programs that we adopt in the future may differ materially from our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations as summarized in this discussion and analysis. Our Compensation Philosophy Our compensation philosophy is to maximize long-term stockholder value by providing compensation with the following two objectives:  Recruiting and retaining executives, including named executive officers, with the skills necessary to lead us to meet or exceed our annual and long-term projections for corporate performance; and  Creating incentives for executives, including named executive officers, to meet or exceed our annual and long-term projections for corporate performance. We believe that we need to provide competitive compensation to achieve our objective of recruiting and retaining qualified executives. We also believe that we need to reward the unique contributions made by each executive to corporate performance in order to achieve our objective of creating incentives for such executives to meet or exceed our annual and long-term projections for such performance. Role of the Board of Managers, Executive Officers and Consultants As the representative of our members, our Board of Managers determined our compensation philosophy in 2007, each element of compensation that our named executive officers were eligible to receive for 2007 service, and the amount that our named executive officers were eligible to receive, and ultimately did receive, under each element of compensation for 2007 service. The Board of Managers coordinated with certain named executive officers and an independent compensation consultant to generate information material to such determination. The process that our Board of Managers followed in making each compensation determination described in this paragraph, and the rationale of our Board of Managers for each such determination, are described in greater detail below in "Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program." In 2007, the Board of Managers requested that our named executive officers provide information primarily relevant to its determination of annual cash bonuses. The specific items of information requested by the Board of Managers is described in greater detail below in "Annual Cash Bonus." The Board of Managers also requested that our named executive officers discuss their position and their duties with independent compensation consultants, to assist such consultants in developing the compensation analysis described in greater detail below. 111 During the second half of 2007, the Board of Managers engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co., or Cook, to serve as its independent consultant with respect to executive compensation. Specifically, Cook assisted the Board of Managers in structuring the executive compensation program that would become effective upon completion of this offering, including suggesting terms for (i) new employment and change in control severance agreements for our executives, including our named executive officers, and (ii) new annual incentive and long-term incentive plans applicable to our executives, including our named executive officers. In connection with structuring the executive compensation program that would become effective upon completion of this offering, the Board of Managers asked Cook to prepare an analysis of the compensation of senior executive officers at other companies in the energy and utilities sector that the Board of Managers deemed comparable to us, and a comparison of the compensation of our named executive officers against the range of compensation of such senior executive officers serving in similar positions with similar duties. The Board of Managers compared its determination of annual cash bonuses for our named executive officers for 2007 against the analysis to ensure that such bonuses were reasonable, in that they fell within a range of bonuses paid to senior executives serving comparable companies in similar positions with similar duties. Cook prepared the analysis described above using two different groups of compensation data. First, Cook used compensation data from 16 companies that the Board of Managers deemed to be our peer group, while recognizing that no companies with publicly available compensation information would fall into the private wind company category. Given the lack of public wind companies and the lack of compensation data regarding private wind companies, such companies were all located in the energy sector, had all completed initial public offerings, and had revenue, EBITDA, net income, market capitalization, total assets, long-term debt, locations and employee populations that the Board of Managers reasonably projected would be comparable to us in some respects after completion of this offering and after we achieve certain operational and growth objectives described in this prospectus. The following companies comprised our peer group: Bill Barrett Corporation; Cheniere Energy, Inc.; Clean Energy Fuels Corp.; Concho Resources Inc.; Energy Conversion Devices, Inc.; Evergreen Solar, Inc.; EXCO Resources, Inc.; ITC Holdings Corp.; Linn Energy, LLC; Ormat Technologies, Inc.; Rosetta Resources Inc.; US BioEnergy Corp.; Venoco, Inc.; VeraSun Energy Corporation; Warren Resources, Inc.; and Whiting Petroleum Corporation. Second, Cook used compensation data from the following survey sources: (i) the IPHRA Power Industry Compensation Survey 2007; (ii) survey data aggregated by Salary.com for companies in the energy and utilities sector with 200 to 500 employees located in Connecticut; and (iii) survey data aggregated by Salary.com for companies in the energy and utilities sector with 200 to 500 employees located in New York. Cook did not disclose the name of each company included in such survey sources and provided to the Board of Managers a summary analysis of the survey sources. The final determination made by the Board of Managers with respect to the annual cash bonuses for our named executive officers for 2007 is described in greater detail below in "Annual Cash Bonus." Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program The principal element of our 2007 executive compensation program was annual cash compensation ( i.e. , base salary and annual cash bonus). We also have provided some named executive officers with limited perquisites that are consistent with the objectives of our executive compensation programs, as discussed below. Each of these compensation elements satisfies one or more of our compensation objectives regarding recruitment, retention and creating incentives for outstanding corporate performance, as described more fully below. We have not adopted any policies with respect to allocating compensation between annual cash compensation and long-term equity compensation, but feel that both elements are necessary for achieving our compensation objectives. Annual cash compensation provides financial 112 stability for each of our named executive officers, and strong incentives to contribute to meeting or exceeding our annual projections of corporate performance. Long-term equity compensation provides strong incentives for our named executive officers to contribute to meeting or exceeding long-term projections of corporate performance. Annual Cash Compensation Base Salary. A competitive base salary is important to our compensation philosophy of maximizing long-term stockholder value because (i) it enables us to recruit and retain qualified executives, including named executive officers, and (ii) it provides executives, including named executive officers, with immediate incentives to contribute to corporate performance, by affording them with a measure of financial stability in exchange for such contributions. Each of our named executive officers, except Mr. Quirke and Ms. Edgley, entered into an employment agreement with us which was effective in 2007 and which established an initial base salary. The employment agreements were the result of arms-length negotiation, and the Board of Managers made a subjective determination that the initial base salary contained in each agreement was competitive and reasonable given the responsibilities, roles and seniority of the relevant named executive officer. The Board of Managers made the following decisions with respect to initial base salaries for the named executive officers in 2007:  Mr. Hinckley received no base salary prior to November 2007. Instead, C.C. Hinckley Co, LLC received a guaranteed monthly payment of $30,000. The guaranteed monthly payment was put in place in the early stages of our development. The guaranteed monthly payments were paid until Mr. Hinckley began to receive a base salary in November 2007.  In September 2007, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Hinckley, which provided him with an initial base salary of $420,000. He began to receive payments in accordance with the employment agreement in November 2007.  As mentioned above, Mr. Quirke did not receive a base salary in 2007. Like Mr. Hinckley, he received a guaranteed monthly payment of $30,000. The guaranteed monthly payment was put in place in the early stages of our development.  Pursuant to an employment offer letter, Ms. Edgley received an initial base salary of $276,000 per year. Her initial base salary was established through arms-length negotiation prior to her beginning employment with us. At the beginning of 2007, we increased her base salary to $281,520 as a cost of living adjustment. As of April 8, 2008, Ms. Edgley is no longer our employee.  In June 2007, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Lowe, which provided him with an initial base salary of $300,000.  In April 2006, we entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Grisaru, which provided her with an initial base salary of $300,000. At the beginning of 2007, we increased her base salary to $306,000 as a cost of living adjustment.  In August 2005, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Swank, which provided him with an initial base salary of $300,000. Annual Cash Bonus. A competitive annual cash bonus is important to our compensation philosophy of maximizing long-term stockholder value because (i) it enables us to recruit and retain qualified executives, including named executive officers, and (ii) it provides executives, including named executive officers, with incentives to make contributions crucial to our corporate performance, by 113 providing them with compensation if we meet or exceed our annual projections for corporate performance. Historically, our annual bonuses have been paid in cash and traditionally have been paid in a single installment in the first quarter following the completion of a given fiscal year. In determining the amount of annual cash bonus that each named executive officer received for 2007 service, the Board of Managers considered the following four factors: (i) the established targets for such bonuses in certain employment agreements for named executive officers effective in 2007; (ii) our actual corporate performance in 2007 relative to our projected corporate performance at the beginning of 2007; (iii) the contributions made by each named executive officer to our corporate performance in 2007; and (iv) a market check against the analysis prepared by Cook, as further described above in "Role of the Board of Managers, Executive Officers and Consultants." Each executive officer, with the exception of Ms. Edgley, received a cash bonus in 2007. Established Targets in Employment Agreements Pursuant to employment agreements effective in 2007, each named executive officer, except Mr. Quirke, was eligible to receive an annual cash bonus. Each named executive officer, except Mr. Quirke and Ms. Edgley, had an established target in his or her employment agreement for the amount of the annual cash bonus. As mentioned above, the employment agreements were the result of arms-length negotiation, and the Board of Managers made a subjective determination that the established target contained in each agreement was competitive. The following are the established targets for each named executive officer, other than Mr. Quirke and Ms. Edgley: (i) 100% of base salary for Mr. Hinckley; (ii) 66.67% of base salary for Mr. Lowe; (iii) between 25% and 50% of base salary for Ms. Grisaru; and (iv) anticipated to be no less than $250,000 for Mr. Swank. Notwithstanding the established target, the employment agreement for Mr. Hinckley provided him with a guaranteed minimum bonus for 2007 equal to 25% of his base salary. The guaranteed minimum bonus was the result of arms-length negotiations with Mr. Hinckley over his employment agreement. As mentioned above, we did not enter into an employment agreement with Mr. Quirke in 2007. The process for determining the discretionary payment for Mr. Quirke and Ms. Edgley is the same as the process for determining the annual cash bonus for the other named executive officers. Corporate Performance in 2007 At the beginning of 2007, the Board of Managers requested that Mr. Hinckley provide a general overview of our corporate performance at that time with respect to (i) the development, hedging and construction of the Initial New York Windparks, (ii) the status of our future project development pipeline, and (iii) the status of certain financings to be finalized in 2007. The Board of Managers then developed a general, qualitative projection of where our corporate performance, especially with respect to each of the criteria described above, should be by the end of 2007. At the end of 2007, the Board of Managers evaluated our actual corporate performance in 2007, especially with respect to each of the criteria described above, against its general, qualitative projections or our corporate performance. The Board of Managers determined that progress toward commencing operation of the Initial New York Windparks was made, we met several key development milestones for the New York 2008 windparks and the Great Plains windparks, we advanced future projects' development, and we closed the turbine credit facility, enabling the purchase of wind turbines under turbine supply agreements. Individual Contributions to Corporate Performance As described below, individual contributions to corporate performance were a factor in the amount of cash bonus that each named executive officer received in 2007. Specifically, the Board of Managers made a subjective determination with respect to each named executive officer concerning whether that 114 individual had met the Board's expectations in their respective roles, responsibilities and contributions to the company in 2007. Specifically, the Board determined that:  Mr. Hinckley managed our ability to move the Initial New York Windparks toward operation, originate and advance the Great Plains project toward a 2008 construction start, advance the 2008 New York windparks toward a 2008 construction start, closed the financing for the Initial New York windparks, and otherwise continued to build our management infrastructure;  Mr. Quirke managed our ability to complete the development of the Initial New York Windparks, originate the Great Plains project, and move the New York 2008 windparks toward a 2008 construction start;  Mr. Lowe made significant financial decisions to develop the company and played a critical role in the financial closing of the turbine facility;  Ms. Grisaru managed the negotiation of regulatory and environmental matters and further developed the company's legal department; and  Mr. Swank implemented major contracts and created the structure of our hedging strategy for our 2007 and 2008 windparks. In assessing the cash bonus amount for Mr. Hinckley, Mr. Hinckley wrote a formal self-evaluation and submitted the evaluation to the Board of Managers. The Board of Managers considered Mr. Hinckley's self-evaluation and the factors listed in the above paragraph to determine the 2007 cash bonus amount for Mr. Hinckley. The process for determining 2007 cash bonus amounts for the other named executive officers followed a similar process to that of Mr. Hinckley. Each named executive officer performed a self-evaluation of performance during 2007 and submitted the evaluation to Mr. Hinckley. Taking under consideration the self-reviews, Mr. Hinckley performed written appraisals of performance for each named executive officer. Based on those appraisals and the corporate performance factors listed in the above paragraph, Mr. Hinckley proposed the bonus amount for each named executive officer to the Board of Managers. Market Check of Proposed Annual Bonus Amounts The Board of Managers then performed a market check against the analysis prepared by Cook, as further described above in "Role of the Board of Managers, Executive Officers and Consultants." Annual Cash Bonus Determinations Based on the factors set forth above, the Board of Managers approved annual cash bonuses for each of the named executives. The amount of the annual cash bonuses are shown below in the "2007 Summary Compensation Table." 115 Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation Historically, we have used our equity-based compensation program as an incentive to recruit and retain executives, to reward outstanding performance and to focus our management on the task of creating long-term stockholder value. Our founding executives, Messrs. Hinckley and Quirke, directly or indirectly own Series A Preferred Units. Messrs. Hinckley and Quirke, along with other named executive officers, also own partially participating Series A Incentive Units and Series A Performance Units. Except for the non-compensatory purchases made by Rockfield Noble Holding, LLC as described in "Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsIssuances of Equity Interests to Founders and Control Persons, none of the named executive officers purchased Series A Preferred Units, Series A Incentive Units or Series A Performance Units in 2007. In 2008 we offered Mr. Lowe the opportunity to purchase 10,775 Series A Incentive Units and 8,725 Series A Performance Units. Mr. Lowe purchased those Series A Incentive Units and Series A Performance Units in February 2008. All Series A Preferred Units, Series A Incentive Units and Series A Performance Units convert into shares of our common stock as of the date of our corporate reorganization effected by way of a conversion prior to the consummation of this offering, which is further described in "Corporate Reorganization." We plan to adopt an equity incentive plan, effective upon the completion of this offering, to further our objectives of recruiting and retaining exceptional executive officers, to give our executive officers an incentive to participate in long-term growth and financial success, and to further align the interests of our executives with our stockholders. Specifically, we will adopt our 2008 Equity Incentive Award Plan, which is further described in " ." General Benefits All of our executive officers are eligible for benefits offered to employees generally, including life, health, disability and dental insurance and our 401(k) plan. These benefits are designed to provide a stable array of support to employees and their families and are provided to all employees regardless of their individual performance levels. In 2007, we continued our historical practice and paid for all medical, dental, vision, life, and disability insurance coverage for all of the named executive officers (and their spouses and dependents, where applicable), including health savings account contributions up to the level of the plan deductibles. We anticipate that, beginning in 2009, we will cease paying for medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance coverage and health savings account contributions for named executive officers, except under plans and programs offered to all employees generally. Additionally, eligible employees may make voluntary contributions to our 401(k) plan up to limits permitted under law, and we may, at our discretion, make profit sharing contributions to our 401(k) plan. All full-time employees who have completed one full calendar month of service are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan. We made no profit sharing contributions to our 401(k) plan on behalf of the named executive officers in 2007. Perquisites As a general matter, we do not intend to offer perquisites or other benefits to any executive officer, including the named executive officers, with an aggregate value in excess of $10,000, because we do not believe it is necessary for the attraction or retention of management talent. In 2007, however, we fully reimbursed our named executive officers for all medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits, as discussed above. We also provided Mr. Hinckley and Mr. Quirke with the use of a company automobile. In 2007, we also offered Mr. Lowe reimbursement of costs incurred for temporary housing for a period of up to 60 days and reimbursement of up to $75,000 for his reasonable relocation expenses, as well as an additional payment for all ordinary income taxes imposed on the 116 reimbursements. We reimbursed Mr. Lowe approximately $5,000 for legal fees incurred by him in negotiating his employment agreement with us. In 2007, we reimbursed Mr. Hinckley (through C.C. Hinckley Co, LLC) approximately $20,000 for legal fees incurred by him in negotiating his September 23, 2007 employment agreement. Payments upon Termination or Change in Control As noted above and further described after the 2007 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below, we entered into employment agreements or arrangements with each of our named executive officers. All employment agreements or arrangements in effect as of December 31, 2007 (with the exception of our employment arrangement with Mr. Quirke and our employment agreement with Mr. Swank) contain severance provisions, which are important to our compensation philosophy of maximizing long-term stockholder value because (i) they enable us to recruit and retain qualified executives, including named executive officers, by providing competitive terms of employment, and (ii) they provide our executive officers with a measure of stability in compensation, which focuses our executive officers on the task of creating long-term stockholder value through all corporate events. Additional information regarding these severance provisions, including potential payments pursuant to these severance provisions, is provided below under the heading "Potential Payments Made Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control." Tax Deductibility of Compensation In the review and establishment of our compensation programs, we consider the anticipated accounting and tax implications to us and our executives. While we consider the applicable accounting and tax treatment, these factors alone are not dispositive, and we also consider the cash and non-cash impact of the programs and whether a program is consistent with our overall compensation philosophy and objectives. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a limit on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to covered employees, unless specific detailed criteria are satisfied. In general, the compensation we have provided is not subject to the limitations on deductibility under Section 162(m). However, we reserve the right to design programs that recognize a full range of performance criteria important to our success, even where the compensation paid under such programs may not be deductible. Executive Compensation The following table sets forth the compensation paid in 2007 to our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, our former principal financial officer and each of our three other most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers on December 31, 2007. These six individuals are sometimes referred to collectively as the "named executive officers." 117 2007 Summary Compensation Table Name and Principal Position Year Salary ($) Bonus ($) Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation ($)(1) All Other Compensation ($) Total ($) Charles Hinckley Chief Executive Officer(2) 2007 351,692 (3) 100,000 (4)  38,264 (5) 489,956 Christopher Lowe Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer(6) 2007 148,846  240,000 24,233 (7) 413,069 Anne Edgley Former Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business Operations(8) 2007 281,520   6,650 (9) 288,170 John Quirke Executive Vice President, Development 2007 360,000 (10)  100,000 14,934 (11) 474,934 Elizabeth Grisaru Senior Vice President and General Counsel(12) 2007 306,000  53,200 15,698 (13) 374,898 Thomas Swank Senior Vice President, Commodities and Risk Management 2007 300,000  175,000 9,610 (14) 484,610 (1) This column reflects the amount earned in 2007 by each named executive officer (other than Mr. Quirke) as an annual cash bonus, and by Mr. Quirke as a discretionary payment, as described in "Annual Cash Compensation, Annual Cash Bonus" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.

(3) Series A Incentive Units and Series A Performance Units were sold to the named executive officer and also to trusts and limited liability companies related to the named executive officer. In the event of the named executive officer's termination of employment, we can repurchase the named executive officer's non-participating units at $0.10 per unit. (4) This number represents the Series A Incentive Units that would not be permanently participating units entitled to distributions pursuant to our distribution waterfall in our Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated December 21, 2007 (in this section, the "Operating Agreement") if the applicable named executive officer was terminated as of December 31, 2007. Subject to the achievement of a dollar threshold that was achieved prior to December 31, 2007, 20% of the Series A Incentive Units become permanently participating units under the Operating Agreement on the date of issuance, 26.6% become permanently participating units on the second anniversary of the date of issuance and 26.7% become participating on the third and fourth anniversary of the date of issuance, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment on the applicable date.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control We have summarized below the severance and change in control provisions in the named executive officer employment agreements and arrangements and have shown below the payments and benefits that the named executive officers would have received if, as of December 31, 2007, the named executive officer had experienced a termination of employment with us or we had experienced a change in control. Employment Agreement with Charles Hinckley We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Hinckley on September 23, 2007. The employment agreement does not provide Mr. Hinckley with any additional payments upon a change in control. Pursuant to his employment agreement, in the event that Mr. Hinckley terminates his employment for good reason, we terminate his employment without cause, or Mr. Hinckley experiences a termination of employment due to disability, Mr. Hinckley is entitled to receive: (i) a severance payment equal to twelve months of his base salary, payable in a lump sum ($420,000); (ii) any guaranteed bonus payment that had not yet been paid, which would have equaled 25% of his base 122 salary in 2007; (iii) a pro-rated bonus for his year of termination; and (iv) continued coverage under our health and welfare plans for twelve months, including an annual contribution of $4,000 in January and $1,400 each month thereafter, as adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in the costs of such benefits. If Mr. Hinckley's employment with us had terminated on December 31, 2007, then he would have received a total of $420,000 in cash severance and an estimated value of health coverage of $20,420. "Good reason" generally means a material diminution in his compensation, responsibilities, duties, title or authority, a relocation of his place of employment by more than fifty miles or a material violation of his employment agreement. Pursuant to his employment agreement, in the event that Mr. Hinckley experiences a termination of employment due to his death, then his estate or representative would be entitled to receive: (i) any guaranteed bonus payment that had not yet been paid, which would have equaled 25% of his base salary in 2007; and (ii) a pro-rated bonus for his year of termination. To receive the severance and benefits described above, Mr. Hinckley is required to execute a general release of claims. In addition to executing the release, Mr. Hinckley must comply with non-competition and non-solicitation covenants for one year after his termination of employment, as well as confidentiality, invention assignment and non-disparagement provisions in perpetuity. Employment Agreement with Christopher Lowe We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Lowe on June 19, 2007. This employment agreement does not provide Mr. Lowe with any additional payments upon a change in control. Pursuant to his employment agreement, in the event that Mr. Lowe terminates his employment for good reason, or in the event that we terminate his employment without cause, Mr. Lowe is entitled to receive his annual base salary through June 19, 2009, payable in accordance with normal payroll practices, and continued health coverage for Mr. Lowe and his dependents through June 19, 2009. If Mr. Lowe had terminated his employment with us on December 31, 2007 and been entitled to the severance payments and benefits, then he would have received a total of $437,500 in cash severance and an estimated value of health coverage of $25,500. "Good reason" generally means a material adverse change in his responsibilities, duties or authority, a failure to continue Mr. Lowe as our Chief Financial Officer, a reduction in his base salary, a failure of a successor to assume his employment agreement or a relocation of his place of employment by more than fifty miles or a material breach of his employment agreement. To receive the annual base salary described above, Mr. Lowe is required to execute a general release of claims, which includes a non-disparagement clause. In addition to executing the release, Mr. Lowe must comply with confidentiality and invention assignment provisions in perpetuity. Employment Offer Letter with Anne Edgley We sent an employment offer letter to Ms. Edgley in 2005, summarizing certain terms of her employment. For purposes of this disclosure, we have summarized the benefits that Ms. Edgley would have received pursuant to that offer letter and subsequent arrangements as if, as of December 31, 2007, she had experienced a termination of employment or we had experienced a change in control. Pursuant to the offer letter, in the event that we had terminated Ms. Edgley's employment for convenience or if we had ceased our business activity as of December 31, 2007, she would have been entitled to receive three months of salary ($70,380) and reasonable costs associated with her relocation back to the United Kingdom (estimated at $11,750). 123 Employment Agreement with Elizabeth Grisaru We entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Grisaru on April 17, 2006. Except as described below, the employment agreement does not provide Ms. Grisaru with any additional payments upon a change in control. Pursuant to her employment agreement, in the event that we terminate the employment of Ms. Grisaru without cause, she is entitled to receive twelve months of her annual base salary, payable in accordance with our normal payroll practices. If pursuant to the previous sentence, Ms. Grisaru's employment with us had terminated on December 31, 2007, then she would have received a total of $306,000 in cash severance. In the event that Ms. Grisaru terminates her employment for any reason within six months following a change in control, which does not include this offering, she is entitled to receive six months of her annual base salary, payable in a lump sum. If pursuant to the previous sentence, Ms. Grisaru's employment with us had terminated on December 31, 2007, then she would have received a total of $153,000 in cash severance. To receive the severance and benefits described above, Ms. Grisaru is required to execute a general release of claims. In addition to executing the release, Ms. Grisaru must comply with confidentiality and invention assignment provisions in perpetuity. Equity Compensation As described in "2007 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End," each of the named executive officers, except Mr. Lowe, owned both Series A Incentive Units and Series A Performance Units as of December 31, 2007, a number of which were still subject to meeting participation thresholds set forth in our Operating Agreement. The extent to which the Series A Incentive Units and Series A Performance Units achieve their relative participation thresholds under our Operating Agreement determines to what extent such units are entitled to distributions pursuant to our Operating Agreement's distribution waterfall. The Series A Incentive Units and Series A Performance Units participation rates do not increase as a result of a named executive officer's termination of employment. However, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment with us on the date of a change in control, the participation rates for the Series A Incentive Units become 100% participating upon a change in control (as defined in the Operating Agreement) and certain participation rates for the Series A Performance Units increase upon a change in control if the participation threshold based upon a 30% internal rate of return and 200% return for JPMP's capital contributions to us is exceeded. If we experienced a change in control on December 31, 2007, then the participation rates with respect to the Series A Incentive Units would have become 100%, though we do not believe that the Series A Incentive Units would have received any value under the distribution waterfall. The participation rates for the Series A Performance Units would not have increased if we experienced a change in control on December 31, 2007. 124 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Issuances of Equity Interests to Founders and Control Persons Between September 2004 and February 2005, we sold preferred units to each of our three founders, Charles Hinckley, John Quirke and Peter Mastic (or to certain entities associated with such persons) at a puchase price of $100 per preferred unit.

Termination Payments Payments under the Employment Agreements The employment agreements for each of Mr. Howard, Mr. Hinckley, Mr. Quirke and Ms. Mann provide for the payment of severance benefits to the executive if we terminate the executive's employment without cause or, in the case of Mr. Howard and Mr. Hinckley, in the event they terminate for "good reason." Upon such termination, the executive will be entitled to receive (i) a cash amount equal to six months' salary and (ii) reimbursement for up to six months of the employer's portion of health coverage premiums. The employment agreements for each of Mr. Howard and Mr. Hinckley also provide that if they are terminated without cause or resign for good reason, they will be entitled to receive a cash amount equal to a prorated portion of their respective annual bonuses for the performance period in which they incur a termination of employment, which amount will be calculated based on our performance for the entirety of the performance period. "Good reason" in Mr. Howard's and Mr. Hinckley's employment agreements and the Change in Control Severance Agreements described below generally means (i) a material reduction in salary, (ii) a relocation of the executive's principal place of employment by more than 50 miles, (iii) for Mr. Howard, a material and adverse reduction in duties, responsibilities or authority and, for Mr. Hinckley, a material and adverse reduction in duties or (iv) only under the Change in Control Severance Agreements described below, the failure of a successor to assume the Change in Control Severance Agreement. Change in Control Severance Agreements On May 5, 2008, we entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with each of Mr. Howard, Mr. Hinckley, Mr. Quirke and Ms. Mann. In general, the Change in Control Severance Agreements provide severance benefits to the executive if we terminate his or her employment without cause or if the executive resigns his or her employment for "good reason" during the period commencing as of the date of our change in control, which does not include this offering, and ending 12 months later. In the event an executive is entitled to a payment under a Change in Control Severance Agreement, he or she is not entitled to severance benefits under his or her employment agreement. The term of each Change in Control Severance Agreement commences on the date that we complete this offering and ends on the first anniversary of the offering. "Good reason" in Mr. Quirke's and Ms. Mann's Change in Control Severance Agreements generally means (i) a relocation of the 127 executive's principal place of employment by more than 50 miles, (ii) a material and adverse reduction in authority or title or (iii) for Ms. Mann, a change that requires her to report to someone other than the Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control Severance Agreements for Mr. Howard and Mr. Hinckley, upon a termination of employment described above, Mr. Howard or Mr. Hinckley will be entitled to receive (i) a cash amount equal to twelve months of salary, (ii) a cash amount equal to a prorated portion of the annual bonus to which Mr. Howard or Mr. Hinckley would have been eligible to receive for the performance period in which Mr. Howard or Mr. Hinckley incurred a termination of employment, which amount will be calculated based on our performance for the entirety of the performance period, and (iii) reimbursement for up to twelve months of the employer's portion of health coverage premiums. In addition to the severance benefits described in this paragraph, in the event of any legal proceeding relating to the Change in Control Severance Agreements for Mr. Howard or Mr. Hinckley, we will be responsible for paying a maximum of $10,000 of attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such proceeding, provided, however, that Mr. Howard or Mr. Hinckley will reimburse us for such attorneys' fees if either Mr. Howard or Mr. Hinckley, as applicable, does not materially prevail in such proceeding. Mr. Quirke and Ms. Mann are entitled to the same severance benefits under the Change in Control Severance Agreement as they are entitled to under the employment agreement and described above. In the event that the amounts payable to any executive under the Change in Control Severance Agreement, together with the amounts payable under any other plan maintained by us, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the payments under the Change in Control Severance Agreement will be reduced until no amount payable constitutes an "excess parachute payment." However, this reduction will not be made if the net after-tax payment to the executive if such reduction had not been made would be greater than the net after-tax payment to the executive if such reduction had been made. Release and Restrictive Covenants Each employment agreement and Change in Control Severance Agreement provides that in order for an executive to receive any severance benefits under the agreements, the executive must execute a general release of claims arising under the employment agreement or Change in Control Severance Agreement within 30 days following termination of employment. Each employment agreement and Change in Control Severance Agreement includes non-competition covenants applicable to the executive for 6 months following termination of employment for any reason (except as described below) and non-solicitation covenants applicable to the executive for 12 months following termination of employment for any reason. The Change in Control Severance Agreements for Mr. Howard and Mr. Hinckley and the employment agreement for Mr. Hinckley provides additional time for non-competition covenants. Pursuant to the Change in Control Severance Agreements for Mr. Howard and Mr. Hinckley, non-competition covenants are applicable for 12 months following termination of employment for any reason. Pursuant to the employment agreement for Mr. Hinckley, we have the right to extend the time period during which the non-competition covenants apply for a maximum of six additional months after the initial six month non-compete period. To exercise that right, we must provide Mr. Hinckley with the following payments for each additional month: (i) a cash amount equal to one month of his salary; and (ii) reimbursement for the employer's portion of health coverage premiums for one month. We must exercise this right within 30 days after Mr. Hinckley incurs a termination of employment and must specify in writing the number of months to which the extension shall apply. In addition, each of the employment and Change in Control Severance Agreements with each of the executives provides that all confidential information that the executive has access to, uses or creates 128 during his employment and all intellectual property resulting from work done by him on our behalf is our property. Each of the agreements also includes customary confidentiality provisions and non-disparagement provisions. Other Transactions On March 15, 2007, we entered into an employment agreement with Andrew Hinckley, the brother of Charles Hinckley, our Executive Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Andrew Hinckley received a salary and bonus of $177,941 in 2007. On March 31, 2008, we entered into a new employment agreement with Andrew Hinckley, which terminated our previous employment agreement with him. Pursuant to the 2008 employment agreement, Mr. Hinckley is employed as our Director, Business Development at an annual base salary of $165,000. In addition to his base salary, Mr. Hinckley is also entitled to success fees based on the successful development of certain of our windparks identified in his employment agreement. The success fees range from $12,500 to $100,000 for each windpark, with possible payments totaling $456,000. For each windpark, Mr. Hinckley is entitled to receive (i) one-third of the success fee upon closing of construction financing of the subject project, or in the event construction financing is not obtained, upon full release for construction of the subject project; (ii) one-third upon term conversion of the financing for the subject project or, in the event term financing is not obtained, upon commercial operation of the subject project; and (iii) one-third 180 days following the date identified in (ii) above. Mr. Hinckley is also entitled to participate in employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements which are applicable to other similarly situated employees. We or Mr. Hinckley may terminate the employment agreement, with or without cause, with 90 days' prior written notice or 90 days' base pay in lieu of written notice. If we terminate Mr. Hinckley's employment for cause, as defined in the agreement, neither the 90 days' written notice nor the 90 days' base pay is required. If we terminate Mr. Hinckley's employment without cause, Mr. Hinckley is entitled to receive his base salary until the earlier of 90 calendar days following the last day of his employment with us, or such time that Mr. Hinckley begins employment with another employer, establishes his own business, or works as a consultant for another entity. In January 2008, we entered into a compensation arrangement with Barry Goldstein, an independent director. Pursuant to this arrangement, Mr. Goldstein is entitled to receive annual board of managers member cash compensation of $40,000 and annual committee member compensation of $10,000. He will also be offered the opportunity to purchase common units. Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions As a public company, we will ensure that all transactions with related parties are fair, reasonable and in our best interest. In this regard, our independent directors or one of our committees comprised of independent directors will review material transactions between us and related parties to determine that, in their best business judgment, such transactions meet that standard. 129 PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS The following table provides certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our outstanding common stock after giving effect to our corporate reorganization for:  each person or group who beneficially owns more than 5% of our outstanding common stock;  each of our named executive officers;  each of our directors; and  all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

They may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand them fully, you should read our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the forms of which will be filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. The following descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the certificate of incorporation and by-laws and to the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. General Our authorized capital stock consists of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and shares of preferred stock, par value $ per share. At the completion of this offering, there will be shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Common Stock Voting. The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of common stock owned by that stockholder on every matter properly submitted to the stockholders for their vote. Stockholders are not entitled to vote cumulatively for the election of directors. Generally, all matters to be voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority or, in the case of election of directors, by a plurality of our outstanding voting power. Dividend Rights. Subject to the dividend rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends and other distributions of cash or any other right or property as may be declared by our board of directors out of our assets or funds legally available for such dividends or distributions. Liquidation Rights. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, holders of our common stock would be entitled to share ratably in our assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders after payment of liabilities. If we have any preferred stock outstanding at such time, holders of the preferred stock may be entitled to distribution and/or liquidation preferences. In either such case, we must pay the applicable distribution to the holders of our preferred stock before we may pay distributions to the holders of our common stock. Conversion, Redemption and Preemptive Rights. Holders of our common stock have no conversion, redemption, preemptive, subscription or similar rights. Preferred Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, subject to limitations prescribed by law, to issue up to shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further stockholder approval. The board will have discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of, including, without limitation, voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences of, and to fix the number of shares of, each series of our preferred stock. Limitations on Directors' Liability Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions indemnifying our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. Prior to the completion of this offering, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors which may, in some cases, be broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained under Delaware law. 132 In addition, as permitted by Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation provides that no director will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. The effect of this provision is to restrict our rights and the rights of our stockholders in derivative suits to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except that a director will be personally liable for:  any breach of his or her duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;  acts or omissions not in good faith which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;  the payment of dividends or the redemption or purchase of stock in violation of Delaware law; or  any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. This provision does not affect a director's liability under the federal securities laws. To the extent that our directors, officers and controlling persons are indemnified under the provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Delaware law or contractual arrangements against liabilities arising under the Securities Act, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, and Delaware Law that May Have an Anti-Takeover Effect Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws Certain provisions that will be in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws summarized below may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interests, including attempts that might result in a premium being paid over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. Classified Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation provides that the number of directors is fixed by our board of directors. Our directors are divided into three classes, each class consisting as nearly as possible of an equal number of directors. Currently, the terms of office for the three classes of directors expire, respectively, at our annual meetings in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The term of the successors of each class of directors expires three years from the year of election. Directors elected by stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders will be elected by a plurality of all votes cast. Special Meetings. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our chairman of the board, or our board of directors. Stockholders are not permitted to call, or to require that the board of directors call, a special meeting of stockholders. Moreover, the business permitted to be conducted at any special meeting of stockholders is limited to the business brought before the meeting pursuant to the notice of the meeting given by us. Our by-laws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before meetings of our stockholders. Actions by Written Consent. Stockholder action by written consent in lieu of a meeting may only be taken so long as the sponsors own a majority of our outstanding common stock. Thereafter, stockholder action only can be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. The foregoing proposed provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. These provisions are 133 intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions also are intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and, as a consequence, they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management. Delaware Takeover Statute We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any "business combination" (as defined below) with any "interested stockholder" (as defined below) for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: (i) prior to such date, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) on consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned (x) by persons who are directors and also officers and (y) by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or (iii) on or subsequent to such date, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 / 3 % of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law defines "business combination" to include: (i) any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder; (ii) any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder; (iii) subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder; (iv) any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or (v) the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation. In general, Section 203 defines an "interested stockholder" as any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person. Stock Exchange Listing We have applied to list our common stock for quotation on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "NEPI." Transfer Agent and Registrar We have appointed as the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock. 134 SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, in the public market following the offering, the market price of our common stock could decline. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity- related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Upon completion of this offering, we will have outstanding shares of common stock, assuming no exercise of outstanding options. Of these shares, the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by our "affiliates," as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The remaining shares of common stock were issued and sold by us in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and are restricted securities. Of these shares, a total of shares are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters that are described in the "Underwriting" section of this prospectus. The restrictions imposed by the lock-up agreements will be in effect for a period of at least 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to extension under certain circumstances for an additional period of up to 34 days, as described under "UnderwritingLock-Up Agreements." At any time and without notice, may, in its sole discretion, release some or all of the securities from these lock-up agreements. In addition, as of , 2008, there were additional outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock, of which are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters or with us that prohibit their sale for at least 180 days. The following table describes the number of outstanding shares that will become eligible for sale in the public market on several relevant dates, assuming no extension of the lock-up agreements. Relevant Dates Number of Shares Eligible for Future Sale On effective date 180 days after effective date More than 181 days after effective date All of our directors, executive officers and stockholders have agreed that they will not, without the prior written consent of , sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of common stock or options to acquire shares of common stock during the 180-day period following the closing of this offering. See "UnderwritingLock-up Agreements." Rule 144 In general, Rule 144 allows a stockholder (or stockholders where shares are aggregated) who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of ours at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned shares of our common stock for at least six months (including the holding period of any prior owner other than an affiliate) to sell its shares, subject to certain notice requirements and to the availability of current pubic information about us. An "affiliate" is a person that directly, or indirectly, through one or more intermediate controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with us. Under Rule 144, a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of ours at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, would be entitled to sell those shares without regard to the public information or notice requirements of Rule 144. 135 To the extent that our affiliates sell their shares, other than pursuant to Rule 144 or a registration statement, the purchaser's holding period for the purpose of effecting a sale under Rule 144 commences on the date of transfer from the affiliate. Rule 701 In general, under Rule 701 of the Securities Act as currently in effect, any of our employees, consultants or advisors who purchases shares of our common stock from us in connection with a compensatory stock or option plan or other written agreement is eligible to resell those shares 90 days after the effective date of the offering in reliance on Rule 144, but without compliance with some of the restrictions, including the holding period, contained in Rule 144. Following the offering, we intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering approximately shares of common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of stock options, subject to outstanding options or reserved for issuance under our employee and director stock benefit plans. Accordingly, shares registered under the registration statement will, subject to Rule 144 provisions applicable to affiliates, be available for sale in the open market, except to the extent that the shares are subject to vesting restrictions or the contractual restrictions described above. 136 CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS TO NON-UNITED STATES HOLDERS The following discussion is a summary of the material United States federal income tax considerations generally applicable to non-United States holders (as defined below) of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common stock issued pursuant to this offering. This discussion is not a complete analysis of all the potential United States federal income tax consequences relating thereto, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under any state, local or non-United States tax laws or any other United States federal tax laws. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, all as in effect as of the date of this offering. These authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may change, possibly retroactively, resulting in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS with respect to the matters discussed below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position regarding the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of our common stock, or that any such contrary position would not be sustained by a court. This discussion is limited to non-United States holders who purchase our common stock issued pursuant to this offering and who hold our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all United States federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular holder in light of that holder's particular circumstances. This discussion also does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may be relevant to holders subject to special rules under the United States federal income tax laws, including, without limitation, former United States citizens or residents, partnerships and other pass-through entities, "controlled foreign corporations," "passive foreign investment companies," corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax, financial institutions, insurance companies, brokers, dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies, tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons who hold or receive our common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation and persons holding our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-UNITED STATES TAX LAWS AND ANY OTHER UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX LAWS. For purposes of this discussion, a non-United States holder is any beneficial owner of our common stock that is not a "United States person" for United States federal income tax purposes. A United States person is any of the following:  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) or a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 137  a trust (i) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or (ii) that has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes. If a partnership (or other entity taxed as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, partnerships that hold our common stock and partners in such partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific United States federal income tax consequences to them. Distributions on our Common Stock Distributions of cash or property on our common stock will constitute dividends for United States federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Amounts not treated as dividends for United States federal income tax purposes first will constitute a return of capital and be applied against and reduce a holder's adjusted tax basis in its common stock, but not below zero. Any excess will be treated as capital gain. Dividends paid to a non-United States holder of our common stock that are not effectively connected with a United States trade or business conducted by such holder generally will be subject to United States federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends, or such lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-United States holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a valid IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable successor form) certifying such holder's qualification for the reduced rate. This certification must be provided to us or our paying agent prior to the payment of dividends and may be required to be updated periodically. Non-United States holders that do not timely provide us or our paying agent with the required certification, but which qualify for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-United States holders should consult their tax advisors regarding possible entitlement to benefits under a tax treaty. If a non-United States holder holds our common stock in connection with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and dividends paid on the common stock are effectively connected with such holder's United States trade or business, the non-United States holder will be exempt from United States federal withholding tax. To claim the exemption, the non-United States holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI (or applicable successor form), certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the non-United States holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States Any dividends paid on our common stock that are effectively connected with a non-United States holder's United States trade or business (or, if required by an applicable tax treaty, attributable to a permanent establishment (or, for an individual, a fixed base) maintained by the non-United States holder in the United States) generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on a net income basis in the same manner as if such holder were a United States person. A non-United States holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty. Non-United States holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules. 138 Gain on Sale or Disposition of our Common Stock A non-United States holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our common stock unless:  the gain is effectively connected with the non-United States holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if required by an applicable tax treaty, attributable to a permanent establishment (or, for an individual, a fixed base) maintained by the non-United States holder in the United States;  the non-United States holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met; or  our common stock constitutes a United States real property interest by reason of our status as a United States real property holding corporation, or USRPHC, during the relevant statutory period. Unless an applicable tax treaty provides otherwise, gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on a net income basis in the same manner as if such holder were a United States person. A non-United States holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty. Non-United States holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules. Gain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to United States federal income tax at a flat 30% rate, but may be offset by United States source capital losses of the non-United States holder. With respect to the third bullet point above, if we are or become a USRPHC, so long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (such as the Nasdaq Global Market), within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations, our common stock will be treated as United States real property interests only with respect to a non-United States holder that actually or constructively holds more than 5 percent of our common stock at any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding We must report annually to the IRS and to each non-United States holder the amount of dividends on our common stock paid to such holder and the amount of any tax withheld with respect to those dividends, together with other information. These information reporting requirements apply even if no withholding was required because the dividends were effectively connected with the holder's conduct of a United States trade or business, or withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. This information also may be made available under a specific treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-United States holder resides or is established. Under certain circumstances, the Code imposes a backup withholding obligation (currently at a rate of 28%) on certain reportable payments. However, backup withholding generally will not apply to payments of dividends to a non-United States holder of our common stock provided the non-United States holder furnishes to us or our paying agent the required certification as to its non-United States status, such as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Payments of the proceeds from a disposition by a non-United States holder of our common stock made by or through a non-United States office of a broker generally will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However, information reporting (but not backup withholding) will 139 apply to those payments if the broker is a United States person, a controlled foreign corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with a United States trade or business for a specified three-year period or a foreign partnership if at any time during its tax year (i) one or more of its partners are United States persons who hold in the aggregate more than 50% of the income or capital interest in such partnership or (ii) it is engaged in the conduct of a United States trade or business, unless the broker has documentary evidence that the beneficial owner is a non-United States holder or an exemption is otherwise established, provided that the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person or that the conditions of any other exemption are not, in fact, satisfied. Payment of the proceeds from a non-United States holder's disposition of our common stock made by or through the United States office of a broker may be subject to information reporting. Backup withholding will apply unless the non-United States holder certifies as to its non-United States holder status under penalties of perjury, such as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person or that the conditions of any other exemption are not, in fact, satisfied. Non-United States holders should consult their tax advisors on the application of information reporting and backup withholding to them in their particular circumstances. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a non-United States holder's United States federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-UNITED STATES TAX LAWS AND ANY OTHER UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX LAWS. 140 UNDERWRITING Lehman Brothers Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC are acting as the representatives of the underwriters and book-running managers in connection with this offering. Under the terms of an underwriting agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement, each of the underwriters named below has severally agreed to purchase from us the respective number of shares of common stock shown opposite its name below: Underwriters Number of Shares Lehman Brothers Inc. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Total The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters' obligation to purchase shares of common stock depends on the satisfaction of the conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, including:  the obligation to purchase all of the shares of common stock offered hereby (other than those shares of common stock covered by their option to purchase additional shares as described below), if any of the shares are purchased;  the representations and warranties made by us to the underwriters are true;  there is no material adverse change in our business or in the financial markets; and  we deliver customary closing documents to the underwriters. Commissions and Expenses The following table summarizes the underwriting discounts and commissions we will pay to the underwriters. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase up to additional shares. The underwriting fee is the difference between the initial price to the public and the amount the underwriters pay to us for the shares. No Exercise Full Exercise Per share $ $ Total $ $ The representatives of the underwriters have advised us that the underwriters propose to offer the shares of common stock directly to the public at the public offering price on the cover of this prospectus and to selected dealers, which may include the underwriters, at such offering price less a selling concession not in excess of $ per share. After the offering, the representatives may change the offering price and other selling terms. The expenses of this offering payable by us are estimated to be approximately $ million (excluding underwriting discounts and commissions). Option to Purchase Additional Shares We have granted the underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days after the date of this prospectus to purchase, from time to time, in whole or in part, up to an aggregate of shares of common stock at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions. This option may be exercised to the extent the underwriters sell more than shares of common stock in connection with this offering. To the extent that the underwriters exercise this option, each underwriter 141 will be committed, so long as the conditions of the underwriting agreement are satisfied, to purchase a number of additional shares of common stock proportionate to that underwriter's initial commitment as indicated in the preceding table, and we will be obligated to sell the additional shares of common stock to the underwriters. Lock-Up Agreements We, all of our directors and executive officers and holders of substantially all of our outstanding stock have agreed that, without the prior written consent of , we and they will not directly or indirectly, (i) offer for sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any shares of our common stock (including, without limitation, shares of common stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of any options or warrants) or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock, (ii) enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of common stock or any other securities of the company, (iii) make any demand for or exercise any right or cause to be filed a registration statement, including any amendments thereto, with respect to the registration of any shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock or any of our other securities, or (iv) publicly disclose the intention to do any of these actions for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus. The 180-day restricted period described in the preceding paragraph will be extended if: (i) during the last 17 days of the 180-day restricted period, we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us occurs; or (ii) prior to the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 180-day period, in which case the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph will continue to apply until the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the announcement of the material news or material event, unless such extension is waived in writing by the representatives of the underwriters. , in its sole discretion, may release the common stock and other securities subject to the lock-up agreements described above in whole or in part at any time with or without notice. When determining whether or not to release common stock and other securities from lock-up agreements, will consider, among other factors, the holder's reasons for requesting the release, the number of shares of common stock and other securities for which the release is being requested and market conditions at the time. Offering Price Determination Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price will be negotiated between the representatives and us. In determining the initial public offering price of our common stock, the representatives will consider:  the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;  our financial information;  an assessment of management and our business potential and earning prospects;  the prevailing securities market conditions at the time of this offering; and  the recent market prices of, and the demand for, publicly traded shares of generally comparable companies. 142 Indemnification We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, liabilities arising from breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the underwriting agreement, and to contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make for these liabilities. Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids The underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, short sales and purchases to cover positions created by short sales, and penalty bids or purchases for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of our common stock, in accordance with Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:  Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.  A short position involves a sale by the underwriters of shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriters are obligated to purchase in the offering, which creates the syndicate short position. This short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of shares involved in the sales made by the underwriters in excess of the number of shares they are obligated to purchase is not greater than the number of shares that they may purchase by exercising their option to purchase additional shares. In a naked short position, the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in their option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters may close out any short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares and/or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through their option to purchase additional shares. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.  Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions.  Penalty bids permit the representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the common stock originally sold by the syndicate member is purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock. As a result, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions may be effected on The NASDAQ Global Market or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor any of the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock. In addition, neither we nor any of the underwriters make representation that the representatives will engage in these stabilizing transactions or that any transaction, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Electronic Distribution A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on Internet sites or through other online services maintained by one or more of the underwriters and/or selling group members participating in 143 this offering, or by their affiliates. In those cases, prospective investors may view offering terms online and, depending upon the particular underwriter or selling group member, prospective investors may be allowed to place orders online. The underwriters may agree with us to allocate a specific number of shares for sale to online brokerage account holders. Any such allocation for online distributions will be made by the representatives on the same basis as other allocations. Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on any underwriter's or selling group member's web site and any information contained in any other web site maintained by an underwriter or selling group member is not part of the prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, has not been approved and/or endorsed by us or any underwriter or selling group member in its capacity as underwriter or selling group member and should not be relied upon by investors in deciding whether to purchase any shares of common stock. The NASDAQ Global Market We intend to apply to have our shares of common stock listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "NEPI."

Relationships The underwriters may in the future perform investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they may in the future receive customary fees and expenses. The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with or perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business.

Alternative energy: Energy generated from non-fossil fuels. Biofuels: Liquid fuels produced from biomass (plant and animal) feedstocks. Biomass: Mass of non-fossil organic material from biological sources, including usable plant matter and the residues of previously used biomass (e.g. agricultural waste, domestic waste, animal residue and forestry waste). Borescopic: Relating to visual instruments that enable users to see inside areas of machined, welded and molded parts. BTU: British thermal unit. The amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Capacity: Capacity represents the potential maximum output, measured in megawatts, that an electric generating facility can generate. In connection with wind generation, capacity represents the maximum output, measured in megawatts, that an individual wind turbine generator is designed to produce. The capacity of a windpark equals the capacity of the generators multiplied by the number of generators included in the windparks. Capacity market: Formal market where power generators sell their availability to generate electricity to a system operator or load serving entity. Carbon dioxide or CO2: A chemical compound composed of two oxygen atoms covalently bonded to a single carbon atom. Carbon dioxide is generated as a byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuels or vegetable matter, among other chemical processes. Clean energy: See renewable energy. Cogeneration: Technique for the combined generation of heat and electricity. The advantage of cogeneration is that the heat generated by combustion may be recovered and upgraded, whereas this heat is lost in traditional generation of electricity. Collection line: An electrical line that ties together individual wind turbines and transmits electrical energy to the substation. Deregulation: The elimination of some or all regulations from a previously regulated industry or sector of an industry. Easement: A right to use a part of land which is owned by another person or organization. Electrical load: The amount of power delivered by a generator or carried by a circuit. Exempt wholesale generator or EWG: Wholesale generators created under the 1992 Energy Policy Act that are exempt from certain financial and legal restrictions stipulated in the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935. Fossil fuels: Carbon-based combustibles derived from carbon fossil deposits, including coal, petroleum and natural gas. Gearbox: A mechanical component that transmits mechanical power from one device to another. Generally the input drive to a gear box is of a different rotational speed than the output of the gear 147 box. Gearboxes are used in wind turbines to transmit mechanical power from the wind turbine blades at a low rotational speed to the wind turbine generator at a higher rotational speed. Greenhouse gases: Those gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride, that are transparent to solar (short-wave) radiation but opaque to long-wave (infrared) radiation, thus preventing long-wave radiant energy from leaving Earth's atmosphere. The net effect is a trapping of absorbed radiation and a tendency to warm the planet's surface. Grid: An infrastructure that brings power from the generation facility to the users. Hedged volume: The volume of power that is bought and sold through physical contracts or that is the subject of financial swaps, in either case so as to eliminate price fluctuations. Hydro or Hydroelectric: A renewable form of electricity generation produced using the force of moving water to drive a turbine alternator, which generates electricity. Independent system operator or ISO: An independent, federally regulated entity established to coordinate regional transmission in a non-discriminatory manner and ensure the safety and reliability of the electric system. Installed capacity or ICAP: Production capacity of a power plant or windpark based either on its rated (nameplate) capacity or actual capacity. Interconnection: Two or more electric systems having a common transmission line that permits a flow of energy between them. The physical connection of the electric power transmission facilities allows for the sale or exchange of energy. Joule: A unit of work or energy equal to one watt for one second. One kilowatt hour equals 3,600,000 Joules. Kilowatt or kW: A unit of power where 1,000 Watts equals 1 kilowatt. Kilowatt hour or kWh: Unit of energy: 1kWh = 1,000 W over a period of one hour. Kinetic energy: Energy available as a result of motion that varies directly in proportion to an object's mass and the square of its velocity. Liquid energy market: Deregulated energy market with active trading volume. Megawatt or MW: Unit of power where 1,000 kW equals 1 megawatt Megawatt hour or MWh: Unit of energy: 1MWh = 1,000 kW over a period of one hour. Net Capacity Factor: The percentage represented by the energy output in MWh measured at the revenue meter over a period of time, divided by the product of the capacity of the project in MW times the number of hours in the measurement period. For example, if a 100 MW project generates 306,600 MWh in one year (8,760 hours), the net capacity factor equals 35%. Operations and maintenance or O&M: Maintenance, repair and the general functions of a power plant, distinct from fuel and capital costs. Peak demand: The greatest point of instantaneous electricity consumption within a given period of time. Power pool: An association of two or more interconnected electric systems having an agreement to coordinate operations and planning for improved reliability and efficiencies. 148 Power purchase agreement or PPA: A contract for a customer to buy electricity from a power plant. Price taker: A seller who bids into a power pool and accepts the price determined by other market participants. Production tax credit or PTC: U.S. federal tax incentive that provides wind energy producers (and other select renewable energy producers) with a federal income tax credit based on the amount of electricity produced and sold to unrelated parties. Qualifying facility or QF: A cogeneration or small power production facility that meets certain ownership, operating and efficiency criteria established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA). Regional transmission operator or RTO: An organization that is established to control and manage the transportation (at high voltage) and flows of electricity over an area that is generally larger than the typical power company's distribution system. Renewable energy: Energy derived from renewable energy sources. Renewable energy certificate or REC: The "green" or renewable attribute of electricity that is generated utilizing a renewable energy resource. A wind turbine that produces 1 MWh of electricity produces 1 REC which, in some electricity markets, can be sold separately from the electrical power. Renewable portfolio standards or RPS: Legally mandated minimum requirements for utilities and other load serving entities to procure power from renewable energy sources by certain effective dates. Reserve margin: The amount of unused available capability of an electric power system (at peak load for a power utility system) as a percentage of total capability. Retail energy supplier: Unregulated provider of energy at competitive prices. In retail energy markets, supplier obligations are settled on an hourly or subhourly basis. SODAR: (sonic detection and ranging) systems are used to remotely measure the vertical turbulence structure and the wind profile of the lower layer of the atmosphere. Spot market: Market for the purchase and sale of electricity in real-time (or near real-time) as opposed to forward markets, to which transactions are agreed for delivery and payment of electricity at a future date. Spot price: Price of electricity in the spot market. Substation: Facility equipment that switches, changes, or regulates electric voltage. Tax equity: A method of financing that involves the purchase of an ownership stake in a company with the expectation that a significant portion of the return on investment that will be realized through the allocation of depreciation and other tax losses and credits. Thermal expansion: Characteristic property of most solids and liquids which causes their volume to increase when they are heated. Transformer: An electrical device for changing the voltage of alternating current.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2007 and the period from August 31, 2004 (date of inception) to December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP May 8, 2008 F-2 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES (A Development Stage Enterprise) Consolidated Balance Sheets As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 ASSETS Current Assets: Cash and equivalents $ 46,826,412 $ 6,729,413 Restricted cash 50,401,652 12,994,611 Prepaid and other current assets 9,009,522 1,924,876 Assets of held for sale project (Note 9) 54,497,163  Total current assets 160,734,749 21,648,900 Noncurrent Assets: Property and Equipment: Property and equipment, net (Note 2) 4,652,876 3,105,447 Construction in progress (Note 3) 959,202,140 442,434,982 Total property and equipment, net 963,855,016 445,540,429 Construction material deposits (Note 4) 150,258,854 153,492,436 Deferred financing costs 15,086,513 2,251,200 Other assets (Note 5) 1,207,864 558,953 Total assets $ 1,291,142,996 $ 623,491,918 LIABILITIES AND MEMBERS' EQUITY Current Liabilities: Notes payable (Note 6) $  $ 416,925,568 Accounts payable 29,000,267 54,908,986 Accrued expenses 66,314,279 6,920,764 Fair value of derivative contracts (Notes 1 and 7) 749,908  Liabilities of held for sale project (Note 9) 39,034,666  Total current liabilities 135,099,120 478,755,318 Noncurrent Liabilities: Long-term debt (Note 6) 899,069,562  Fair value of derivative contracts (Notes 1 and 7) 28,164,811  Asset retirement obligations (Note 8) 4,033,142  Commitments and Contingencies (Note 10) Members' Equity: Member contributions 302,522,378 174,259,992 Deficit accumulated during the development stage (72,009,158 ) (29,523,392 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (5,736,859 )  Total members' equity 224,776,361 144,736,600 Total Liabilities and Members' Equity $ 1,291,142,996 $ $623,491,918 See notes to consolidated financial statements.

F-6 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization and Purpose Noble Environmental Power, LLC and subsidiaries ("NEP" or the "Company") is a development stage enterprise that is organized under the laws of Delaware as a limited liability company. NEP was founded on August 31, 2004 to produce new electricity supplies from renewable energy sources, including wind. NEP develops, constructs, owns and plans to operate wind energy projects throughout the United States. There were no projects in operation as of December 31, 2007. The Company commenced operations in March 2008 (see Note 13). In May 2008, in contemplation of an initial public offering of shares of common stock, the Company's Board of Managers approved the Company's conversion to convert from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation at the completion of the offering. Upon effectiveness of this conversion, all of the Company's redeemable preferred and common units will be automatically converted into shares of common stock based on their relative rights as set forth in the Company's limited liability company operating agreement. Specifically, each outstanding common unit will be converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to its pre-offering equity value divided by the midpoint of the anticipated range of the initial public offering price. Each outstanding preferred unit will be converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to its liquidation value divided by the midpoint of the anticipated range of the initial public offering price. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements of NEP include the accounts of all the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries. All individual projects listed in Note 3 are single member LLCs wholly owned by NEP. In addition, NEP wholly owns Noble Services, Inc., which provides payroll and benefit services to the parent and all project subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated. The Company is a development stage enterprise as of December 31, 2007 and for the period from August 31, 2004 (date of inception) to December 31, 2007, since it had not yet generated any revenue from the sale of electricity. From inception through December 31, 2007, its efforts have been principally devoted to the development and construction of wind energy projects. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 7, "Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises." SFAS No. 7 requires certain explanatory disclosures and presentation of inception to date totals within the statements of operations and cash flows. The Company has reported a net loss of $42,485,766, $20,678,777 and $7,759,311 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $72,009,158 for the period from August 31, 2004 (date of inception) to December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had working capital of $25,635,629 and a working capital (deficit) of $(457,106,418) and cash and cash equivalents of $46,826,412 and $6,729,413, respectively. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has accumulated a loss of $72,009,158 since inception, and is in its development stage. In addition, the Company will continue to incur losses into the foreseeable future. Management has evaluated its ability to continue operations and believes that cash and restricted cash on hand, together with expected cash flow from operations during 2008, borrowings under its turbine credit facilities, equity infusions from its Members, F-7 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) capital contributions from tax equity investors and current and future borrowings under project construction and term loans (see Notes 6, 11 and 13) will provide adequate working capital to sustain operations through December 31, 2008. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty. Segment Information The Company has one reportable segment. The Company's chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At various times during the year, cash balances exceeded federally insured limits. The Company's uninsured cash balances (held at various financial institutions) amounted to $65,110,552 and $9,623,269 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Restricted Cash At December 31, 2007 and 2006, NEP had $50,401,652 and $12,994,611 of restricted cash, respectively. The balance at December 31, 2007 consisted of $29,893,390 held in escrow for the payment of interest to be accrued during 2008 on the Second Note (see Note 6) and $20,508,262 of cash collateral associated with certain letter of credit and performance bond arrangements (see Note 10). The balance at December 31, 2006 consisted of $7,501,626 held in escrow for payment of interest accrued during 2007 on the Senior Secured Promissory Note (see Note 6) and $5,492,985 of funds drawn down on the Senior Secured Promissory Note (see Note 6) contractually restricted to be utilized only for expenditures under turbine supply and transportation agreements. These balances are substantially uninsured. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When items of property and equipment are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statement of operations. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Property and Equipment is depreciated as follows: Years Facility 25 Vehicles, machinery and equipment 3 to 7 Computer systems 3 to 5 Office furniture and equipment 5 to 7 Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of 5 years or the term of the lease. F-8 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Capitalization and investment in project assets The Company's windparks have four basic phases: (i) development (which includes pre-development), (ii) financing and commodity risk management, (iii) engineering and construction and (iv) operation and maintenance. The development phase is further divided into pre-development and development sub-phases. During the pre-development sub-phase, milestones are created to ensure that a project is financially viable. Project viability is obtained when it becomes probable that costs incurred will generate future economic benefits sufficient to recover these costs. Examples of milestones required for a viable windpark include the following:  the identification, selection and acquisition of sufficient land for control of the land area required for a windpark;  the confirmation of a regional electricity market and the availability of Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs");  the confirmation of acceptable wind resources;  the confirmation of the potential to interconnect to the electric transmission grid;  the determination of limited environmental sensitivity; and  the confirmation of local community receptivity and limited potential for organized opposition. All project costs are expensed during the pre-development phase. Once the milestones for development are achieved, a project is moved from the pre-development phase into the development and engineering and construction phases. Costs incurred in these phases are capitalized as incurred, included within construction in progress ("CIP"), and not depreciated until placed into commercial service. Once a project is placed into commercial service, all accumulated costs will be reclassified from CIP to property and equipment, and become subject to depreciation or amortization over a 25 year estimated life. Valuation and Recoverability of Long Lived Assets (Property and Equipment) The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of property and equipment, if and when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of property and equipment is considered impaired when its anticipated undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value. A loss is then recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company is in the process of making a significant investment in windpark assets and will continue to make significant investments over the next several years. The Company will evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of our assets may not be recoverable. The Company has not recognized any impairment losses on any of its property and equipment from inception through December 31, 2007. However, the Company has written off certain CIP costs (see Note 3). F-9 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred with the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized over the life of the debt. The Company incurred and capitalized financing costs of $19,431,559 and $2,560,691 during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company amortized $6,596,246 and $309,491 of these costs during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and capitalized these amounts as a component of CIP (see Note 3). Accordingly, deferred financing costs totaled $15,086,513 and $2,251,200 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalized Interest Interest cost is capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 34, " Capitalization of Interest Cost ." The amount of interest to be capitalized is determined by applying an interest rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures during that period, limited by the total amount of interest cost incurred for that period. Defined Contribution Plan During 2007, the Company adopted a 401(k) savings plan (the "Plan") covering all eligible employees as defined in the Plan document. The Plan provides for employee contributions up to specified limits. Participants are vested in 100% of their contributions. Currently, the Company does not match participant contributions; accordingly, there was no contribution expense for the year ended December 31, 2007. Leases Leases that meet certain criteria are classified as capital leases, and assets and liabilities are recorded at amounts equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased properties at the beginning of the respective lease terms. Leases that do not meet such criteria are classified as operating leases and related rentals are charged to expense as incurred (see Note 10). The Company did not have any capital leases as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company has a number of financial instruments, none of which are held for trading purposes. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each of the following financial instruments: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalent items. Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt The carrying amounts are assumed to have a fair value equal to carrying value due to their floating interest rates. Derivative Assets and Liabilities The carrying values of derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. Other Financial Instruments The carrying value of other financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities approximates their fair value due to their short-term nature. The fair value of financial instruments included in other assets is not materially different from their carrying value. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Other comprehensive loss includes changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge. F-10 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Derivative Instruments The Company enters into certain derivative transactions in order to hedge its exposure to certain market risks (see Note 7). NEP primarily uses derivatives to manage its interest rate and commodity exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," (SFAS 133), as amended, the Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met as discussed below. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recorded in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. SFAS 133 enables companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the exposure being hedged. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and are reclassified into income as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness of a cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company prepares formal documentation (at inception) of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with SFAS 133. If it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. The application of SFAS 133 is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives, determination of the fair value of derivatives, identification of hedge relationships, assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness and election and designation of the normal purchases and sales exception. All of these judgments, depending upon their timing and effect, can have a significant impact on NEPs consolidated operations. For cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, NEP estimates the future cash flows represented by the forecasted transactions, and evaluates the probability of occurrence and timing of such transactions. Changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could require discontinuance of hedge accounting or could affect the timing for the reclassification of gains or losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income/loss into earnings. In the event the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer probable, the amount in other accumulated comprehensive income/loss is recognized in earnings and generally the hedge relationship is terminated. Gains resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap. F-11 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Asset Retirement Obligations The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations and conditional assets retirement obligations under SFAS No. 143 " Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations " and Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation (FIN) No. 47 " Accounting for Conditional Assets Retirement Obligations " (See Note 8). Income Taxes From inception through December 31, 2007, the Company has been treated as a partnership for income tax purposes under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, during this period, the Company's federal and state taxable income or loss was passed through to the members for inclusion in each member's income tax return (see Note 13). The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes as prescribed by the SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes." This method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax return and financial statement reporting bases of certain assets and liabilities. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)," which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. The adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. Unaudited Pro Forma Information The Company is currently a Delaware limited liability company. Prior to the completion of this offering, the Company will convert into a Delaware corporation. Upon the effectiveness of the conversion, all of the Company's outstanding preferred and common units will be automatically converted into shares of common stock based on their relative rights as set forth in the Company's limited liability company agreement. Specifically, each outstanding common unit will be converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to its pre-offering equity value divided by the midpoint of the anticipated range of the initial public offering price. Each outstanding preferred unit will be converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to its liquidation value divided by the midpoint of the anticipated range of the initial public offering price. The redeemable preferred units have a liquidation value equal to their initial issuance price at $100, plus accrued yield at 7.5% per annum, compounded quarterly. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate liquidation value of the Company's outstanding redeemable preferred units was $325,379,052. All pro forma share numbers are based on an assumed initial public offering price of $ , the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus. The unaudited pro forma net loss data presents the pro forma effects of applying a provision for income taxes to historical net income. Such provision reflects the income taxes that would have been applicable had the Company been taxed as a C corporation for the year ended December 31, 2007. Pro forma net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average common units outstanding. Pro forma net income (loss) per share is computed as if the conversion into a Delaware corporation described above occurred at the beginning of 2007.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, " Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, " which expands derivative disclosures by requiring an entity to disclose: (i) an understanding of how and why an entity uses derivatives, (ii) an understanding of how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for, and (iii) transparency into the overall impact of derivatives on an entity's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after November 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is encouraged. The Company is currently analyzing the requirements of SFAS 161 and will adopt the standard on January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, " Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, " which significantly changes the financial reporting relationship between a parent and non-controlling interests (i.e., minority interests). SFAS 160 requires all entities to report minority interests in subsidiaries as a separate component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the amount of net income attributable to the non-controlling interest is required to be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. Further, SFAS 160 requires that the transactions between a parent and non-controlling interests should be treated as equity. However, if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, a parent is required to recognize a gain or loss. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. SFAS 160 will be applied prospectively, except for presentation and disclosure requirements which are required to be applied retrospectively. The Company will adopt SFAS 160 effective January 1, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, " The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. " This Statement permits, but does not require, entities to account for financial instruments at fair value. The standard does not extend to non-financial instruments. The Company has elected not to adopt the fair value provisions of SFAS 159. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 " Fair Value Measurements, " which establishes a framework for identifying and measuring fair value and is required to be implemented in the first quarter of 2008. SFAS 157 provides a fair value hierarchy, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and is expected to be applied to fair value measurements of derivative contracts that are subject to mark-to-market accounting and other assets and liabilities reported at fair value. In most cases, SFAS 157 is required to be implemented prospectively with adjustments to fair value reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of members' equity as of January 1, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements; however, SFAS 157 will impact certain 2008 financial statement disclosures.

CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS (Continued) All salaries/wages, insurance costs and overhead costs related to persons directly involved in the development and/or construction of the projects are capitalized during the capitalization period. In addition, all interest and certain fees deferred and amortized in connection with note payable borrowings have been capitalized from August 31, 2004 (date of inception) to December 31, 2007. Unallocated wind turbine inventory costs, other unallocated project costs and construction interest and amortized loan fees are allocated to specific projects upon the closing of construction financing. Asset retirement costs are allocated to specific projects at the commercial operation date. When the construction is complete and the project is placed in service, the capitalized costs are reclassified from construction in progress to property and equipment. During 2007, the Company recognized a charge to operations totaling $573,554 related to previously capitalized costs incurred in connection with the development of Noble Berkshire Windpark. Such costs consisted primarily of internal salaries and overhead, third party engineering, other professional fees and certain material costs. In June 2007, the Company determined to no longer pursue this project. Accordingly, all costs incurred in connection with this project were written off. During 2006, the Company recognized a charge to operations totaling $5,500,000 related to previously capitalized costs incurred in connection with the development of Noble Thumb Windpark I. Such costs consisted primarily of internal salaries and overhead, third party engineering, mobilization and transportation costs, and certain transformer and substation costs. The write-off was determined to be necessary based on changes associated with the scope and interconnection of the original project. The Company determined that the original project should be split into multiple projects. Accordingly, certain costs incurred for the original project could no longer be utilized and were written off. The Company believes all remaining capitalized costs will be fully recoverable (see Note 9). 4. CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL DEPOSITS Construction material deposits consist of payments for wind turbines and pad mount transformers to be delivered in the future. These payments will be reclassified to CIP when the turbines are delivered. 5.

NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT In accordance with SFAS 6, "Classification of Short-Term Obligations to be Refinanced," the Company has classified amounts due under the construction and equity bridge loan facilities as long-term at December 31, 2007. Such classification is deemed appropriate as the Company has both the intent and ability (based on the terms of the financing agreementsee below) to refinance these obligations (see Note 13). Future maturities of notes payable and long-term debt are as follows: 2008 $  2009 25,274,613 2010 488,591,524 2011 28,228,856 2012 30,733,107 Thereafter 353,962,662 $ 926,790,762 Senior and Second Notes On October 26, 2007, NEP Equipment Finance Co, LLP entered into a $460,000,000 First Lien Senior Promissory Note ("Senior Note") with HSH Nordbank AG, New York Branch ("HSH") and a $260,000,000 Second Lien Secured Promissory Note ("Second Note") with Paragon Noble, LLC ("Paragon"). Borrowings on the Senior Note have a maturity date of March 31, 2010 (as defined), bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% or the base rate plus 0.75%, include an upfront fee of $5,600,000 and contains a commitment fee of 0.75% due each quarter on the unused balance of the Senior Note. Maximum borrowings are limited to 80% of certain Turbine Supply Agreements ("TSAs"). At December 31, 2007, NEP had $230,128,566 and $260,000,000 outstanding on the Senior and Second Notes, respectively. Borrowings on the Second Note have a maturity date of July 31, 2010 (as defined), bear interest at 15% per annum, included an upfront fee of $7,800,000 and require three months of interest to be held in reserve. Maximum borrowings are limited to 100% of the positive difference between the aggregate contract price (as defined) paid under all TSAs, and any amounts borrowed under the Senior Note plus $40,000,000 (which represents the portion of the Second Note deposited into escrow for the payment of interest and commitment fees). The interest and commitment fees are due and payable quarterly. (see Note 1restricted cash). The Senior Note and the Second Note contain various financial and non-financial covenants, are secured by certain assets of NEP and are guaranteed by NEP.

The Dexia Facilities are collateralized by substantially all the assets of 2006 Hold Co., are subject to various financial and non-financial covenants and require commitments fees of .375% per quarter on the undrawn loan balances. At December 31, 2007, NEP had $257,100,000 and $179,562,196 outstanding on the construction loan and equity bridge loan, respectively. In connection with the Dexia Facilities, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract to protect against the impact of changes in the benchmark LIBOR interest rate on the variability of the future LIBOR semi-annual interest payments relating to the forecasted ten-year term loan to be issued under the Term Loan Facility (see Note 7). Assets of various subsidiaries totaling $122,133,000 are restricted from distribution by the terms of the Company's notes payable. Short-Term Notes On September 26, 2007 and October 11, 2007, NEP entered into 7.5% short-term notes with JPMP Wind Energy, LLC ("JPMP") and certain affiliates totaling $26,617,500. These JPMP short-term notes were paid off with proceeds from the Senior and Second Notes. Secured Loan (CIT) On May 18, 2007, NEP entered into a $62,000,000 Secured Loan ("Equity Bridge Loan") with CIT Capital USA, Inc. for the payment of certain TSA commitments, interest and fees until such time the Senior and Second Note were secured and closed. The Equity Bridge Loan had an original maturity of September 30, 2007; however, such maturity was extended to October 26, 2007, and bore interest at a floating interest rate based on either (1) any of the one, two, three or six-month periods selected by NEP from time to time with respect to the LIBOR Rate Loans plus 5% or (2) a base rate of the higher of the Prime Rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, plus 2.1% per annum payable quarterly. In addition, the Equity Bridge Loan contained certain non-financial covenants, and a fixed upfront and agency fee plus a commitment fee based on undrawn amounts. NEP guaranteed the Equity Bridge loan and collateralized the Equity Bridge Loan with substantially all its assets. The Equity Bridge Loan balance was paid off with proceeds from the Senior and Second Notes. Senior Secured Promissory Note (Paragon) On October 10, 2006, 2006 Hold Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of NEP entered into a one-year Amended and Restated Senior Secured Promissory Note ("Amended Promissory Note") with Paragon with an initial commitment of $267,000,000. On October 20, 2006, 2006 Hold Co. entered into a Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Promissory Note ("Second Amended Promissory Note") with Paragon and entered into a $147,800,000 Promissory Note with Riverview Group, LLC (collectively, the "Paragon Notes"). The Second Amended Promissory Note served to increase the total commitment under the Paragon Notes to $414,800,000. The Paragon Notes bore interest at 9% per annum and matured on October 10, 2007. F-18 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 6. NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT (Continued) NEP initially deposited $14,168,888 in an escrow account, representing the aggregate amount of the sum of the interest and commitment fees that were projected to accrue during the first five months of the Paragon Notes (See restricted cash disclosure at Note 1). The interest and commitment fees were due and payable quarterly. The Paragon Notes were guaranteed by several subsidiaries of NEP; guaranteed to up to 110% of the committed funds by NEP; collateralized by substantially all the assets of 2006 Hold Co., as well as NEP's equity interest in certain NEP subsidiaries; and contained certain non-financial covenants. These Paragon Notes amend and restate the $153,480,000 Senior Secured Promissory Note (the "Original Promissory Note") with Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG New York Branch ("HVB"), originally dated April 13, 2006. Upon execution of the Paragon Notes, the guarantee by JPMP on the Original Promissory Note was terminated. On June 22, 2007, the Paragon Notes were paid down from the proceeds of the Dexia Facility. On June 22, 2007, the remaining balance of $141,293,772 due on the Paragon Notes was refinanced with a new Senior Secured Promissory Note ("Senior Paragon Note"). The Senior Paragon Note called for interest at 9% per annum, had a maturity date of June 22, 2008, was guaranteed by NEP and contained various financial and non-financial covenants. The Senior Paragon Note also required additional upfront interest of $1,412,938 and required $12,716,439 be escrowed for interest. The Senior Paragon Note was paid off with proceeds from the Senior and Second Notes. Second Secured Promissory Note (CIT) On December 4, 2006, Noble Environmental Power 2007 Equipment Co., LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NEP, entered into a $133,000,000 Senior Secured Promissory Note (the "CIT Note") with financial institutions for which CIT Capital USA, Inc. acted as agent. The CIT Note had an original maturity of September 30, 2007; however, such maturity was extended to October 26, 2007, and bore interest at a floating interest rate based on either (1) any of the one, two, three or six-month periods selected by NEP from time to time with respect to the LIBOR Rate Loans plus 2% or (2) a base rate of the higher of the Prime Rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, payable quarterly. In addition, the CIT Note contained certain non-financial covenants, and a fixed upfront and agency fee plus a commitment fee based on 0.5% of undrawn amounts. Certain subsidiaries of NEP guaranteed the CIT Note and collateralized the CIT Note with substantially all their assets. The CIT Note was entered into to fund certain invoices pursuant to a TSA. The CIT Note balance was paid off with proceeds from the Senior and Second Notes. 7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NEP utilizes derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate and commodity price risk. The Company utilizes an interest rate swap agreement to hedge interest rate risk on floating rate debt, and an energy derivative to hedge the risk related to electricity sales. Interest Rate Swap On November 8, 2007, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract to protect against the impact of changes in the benchmark LIBOR interest rate on the variability of the specified future 6 month LIBOR semi-annual interest payments relating to the Company's forecasted ten year term loan to be issued under the Dexia Facilities (see Note 6). The instrument has a notional amount of $229,078,353, and the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.852% and F-19 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (Continued) receives the floating 6 month LIBOR rate. The contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge. At December 31, 2007, the Company has recorded a current liability of $749,908 and a long-term liability of $4,986,951, with a corresponding charge of $5,736,859 to comprehensive loss in connection with this contract. Energy Hedge On June 22, 2007, NEP entered into a ten-year energy hedging arrangement with Credit Suisse, in order to limit exposure to price volatility in the New York Independent System Operator ("NYISO") energy market with respect to the energy generated by our Bliss, Clinton and Ellenburg windparks (collectively, the "Initial New York Windparks"). Under this financial fixed-for-float energy swap arrangement:  NEP will pay Credit Suisse a monthly amount equal to the product of (1) the prevailing market price for energy that NEP sells in that month, and (2) the actual amount of energy that NEP generated during such month up to a specified cap; and  Credit Suisse will pay NEP a monthly amount equal to the product of (1) a specified fixed price, and (2) the actual amount of energy that NEP generated during such month up to the same specified cap. As part of this agreement, the Company has implemented a tracking account that tracks, on a monthly basis, the difference between the energy production from the Initial New York Windparks and a predetermined notional volume under the swap for that month. The Company's monthly net settlement payments with Credit Suisse may be more or less than would otherwise be due based on the notional volume of the swap. This tracking account was incorporated into the hedge in order to allow the Company to manage the risk associated with the inherent volatility associated with the volume of energy production from a windpark. The tracking account is settled at the end of the end of the ten-year term of the hedging arrangement. As of December 31, 2007, the wind generating assets associated with this instrument were not yet complete. Accordingly, the Company has recorded all changes in fair value within the consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2007, the Company has recorded a current asset of $2,105,000 and a long-term liability of $23,177,860, with a corresponding charge within the consolidated statement of operations of $21,072,860 in connection with this contract. 8. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS NEP accounts for asset retirement obligations ("ARO") and conditional asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS 143 and FIN 47, respectively. SFAS 143 and FIN 47 require that a liability for the fair value of an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The asset retirement cost is subsequently amortized on a straightline basis over a 25 year estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations. F-20 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 8. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (Continued) Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimates of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the asset retirement cost and ARO. At December 31, 2007, the Company recorded an ARO and corresponding asset retirement cost within CIP in the amount of $4,033,142, in connection with the future decommissioning of our Clinton, Bliss and Ellenburg Windparks. The estimated liability is based on the future estimated costs associated with the decommissioning and removal of the turbines and related appurtenances, and the reclamation of foundations and access roads. The liability is calculated based on the following assumptions: Estimated useful life 25 years Inflation factor 2.8 % Credit adjusted risk free discount rate 6.7 % A market risk premium was excluded from the ARO estimate because the amount was not capable of being estimated. Estimates of AROs are based on projected future retirement costs and require management to exercise significant judgment. Such costs could differ significantly when they are incurred. During 2008, the Company will be required by host communities to post decommissioning bonds of $2,985,600 in connection with our Clinton, Bliss and Ellenburg projects. As the projects are not yet operating as of December 31, 2007, the Company was not required to post any bonds, nor record any depreciation or accretion. 9. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE During the fourth quarter of 2007, NEP made a decision to sell the net assets of certain project companies located in Michigan. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," the recoverability of this asset group was tested, and it was determined that these assets were not impaired as of December 31, 2007. Accordingly, no impairment loss was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007. NEP has reflected the related assets and liabilities of such assets as held for sale within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007. As these projects are still in their development stage, there were no reported revenues or expenses associated with this asset group for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Assets of the held for sale project include CIP and turbine deposits. Liabilities include bank debt and accounts payable. On February 29, 2008, NEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "PSA") for the sale of this asset group for approximately $85.1 million, and has scheduled a tentative closing during May 2008. The PSA requires the Company to complete certain development and construction activities prior to the close of the transaction. The sale price is subject to certain adjustments (as defined in the PSA); however, NEP believes that the sale price (less selling expenses) will exceed the carrying amount of this asset group upon the closing of this transaction. Accordingly, the Company does not expect to recognize a loss in connection with this transaction.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Easements NEP develops, constructs and operates windparks for electric generation. In many cases, the entity that constructs the windparks does not own the land on which the windpark is built, which requires the purchase of an easement. The easement generally gives the windpark owner the right to install one or more wind turbines and related equipment and prohibits the landowner from building any other structure on the land that would block the wind that drives the turbines or that would interfere with the maintenance of the windpark. Easements are also used to obtain the right to use property necessary to provide transmission lines and other facilities to create a path that will allow the electricity generated to reach established utility transmission facilities. Easement agreements are contracts that require future payments that are contingent on revenues to be generated from the related properties used by the generating plants. The terms of the easement agreements vary and are complex in nature, but usually cover an evaluation period (which is covered under the development period), a construction period, and an operational period that normally comprises a 20 year period with a developer option for an additional 30 year period. NEP has entered into easement agreements under which the Company would be obligated to pay the landowner based on the amount of revenue or the power generated by the windparks. Turbine Supply Agreements TSA commitments are purchase orders between the buyer (NEP) and the seller that serve as a master contract for the sale of power wind generation equipment and related services. The contract remains effective until expiration of the warranty period. NEP has signed turbine commitments for the delivery and commissioning of turbines in each of the fiscal years detailed in the schedule below. Construction Commitments NEP has construction commitments related to the construction of the projects for the fiscal year 2008. Construction commitments are subcontract agreements between NEP and the subcontractors for materials and/or services to be performed in the near future. Operating Leases NEP has various leases for office space, storage and equipment that are classified as operating leases. Rent expense for all operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and the period from August 31, 2004 (date of inception) to December 31, 2007 was approximately $385,000, $284,000, $136,000 and $805,000, respectively.

Such commitments include interest due in connection with variable rate debt instruments, payments to be made under easement contracts and distributions to tax equity investors. Guarantees and Letters of Credit In the normal course of business, NEP and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds. These arrangements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise achieved by a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the availability of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes. Certain guarantees are granted in connection with the Company's financing agreements (see Note 6). At December 31, 2007, NEP had approximately $95,000,000 and $1,950,000 in letters of credit and performance bonds outstanding, and NEP has posted cash collateral of $18,500,000 and $1,950,000 (see Note 1) for these letters of credit and performance bonds, respectively. Legal proceedings NEP does not have any material legal proceedings that are currently pending. From time to time, the Company or its subsidiaries may be party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. Additionally, although no such claims are currently pending, the Company or its individual project subsidiaries may be subject to legal proceedings contesting the validity of one or more permits or otherwise challenging its authorization to construct and operate windparks. 11. MEMBERS' EQUITY December 31, 2007 The Company operates under the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated December 21, 2007 (the "Second Amended Operating Agreement"). The Amended Operating Agreement was amended to allow for the Company to potentially issue additional preferred units to a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB"). As defined by the Second Amended Operating Agreement, the Company's capital structure consists of common and preferred units. Each common unit is valued at $0.10 and each preferred unit is valued at $100. The Company is authorized to issue 780,750 common F-23 NOBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POWER, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the Period From August 31, 2004 (Date of Inception) to December 31, 2007 11. MEMBERS' EQUITY (Continued) units and 5,354,000 preferred units. The common units are divided into Series A (463,260 units authorized, issued and outstanding) and Series B (317,490 units authorized, none issued and outstanding). The authorized preferred units are divided into three classes, Series A (2,677,000 units), Series B (2,677,000 minus the number of Series C preferred units issued), and Series C (2,677,000 minus the number of Series B preferred units issued). At December 31, 2007, there were 2,677,000, 347,761, and 0 Series A, B and C preferred units issued and outstanding, respectively. The Board of Managers has the right to increase the number of authorized common and preferred units from time to time. Common units have been issued to certain members of the Company's management ("Management Investors") and may be issued to any other managers, employees, officers, consultants or advisors of the Company or its subsidiaries that are approved by the Board of Managers. The Management Investors shall be treated (i) as preferred unit holders with respect to the preferred units held by them and have the same rights and obligations as the other preferred unit holders with respect to such preferred units and (ii) as common unit holders with respect to the common units held by them. All preferred units are intended to be issued in connection with capital contributions made by JPMP, CPPIB, and the Management Investors and any other person approved by the Board of Managers. The preferred units contain a preferred yield that accrues whether earned or declared and is cumulative from the date of issuance of each preferred unit at a rate of 7.5% per annum through September, 2011 and at 15% thereafter. The preferred yield has not been declared (or paid) during the period from August 31, 2004 (date of inception) to December 31, 2007. The total preferred yield is approximately $23,403,000 at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, NEP's Board of Managers consisted of five (5) members where JPMP is entitled to appoint four (4) individuals to the Board of Managers and the majority Common Unit holders are entitled to appoint one (1) individual to the Board of Managers. December 31, 2006 The Company operated under an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated March 27, 2006 (the "Amended Operating Agreement"). As defined by the Amended Operating Agreement, the Company's capital structure consisted of common and preferred units. Each common unit was valued at $0.10 and each preferred unit was valued at $100. The Company was authorized to issue 463,260 common units and 2,677,000 preferred units. The Board of Managers had the right to increase the number of authorized common units and preferred units from time to time. As of December 31, 2006, 463,260 common units and 1,742,137 preferred units were issued and outstanding. JPMP owned 1,734,137 preferred units and NEP management and related entities owned 8,000 preferred units and 463,260 common units. Common units were issued to certain members of the Company's management ("Management Investors") and may be issued to any other managers, employees, officers, consultants or advisors of the Company or its subsidiaries that are approved by the Board of Managers. The Management Investors were treated (i) as preferred unit holders with respect to the preferred units held by them and had the same rights and obligations as the other preferred unit holders with respect to such preferred units and (ii) as common unit holders with respect to the common units held by them. All preferred units were intended to be issued in connection with capital contributions made by JPMP, the Management Investors and any other person approved by the Board of Managers. However, during 2006, certain Management Investors instrumental in founding the Company, were granted 3,000 preferred shares at a value of $300,000 at no cost. The Company recorded this grant as compensation to the respective parties.

MEMBERS' EQUITY (Continued) units contained a preferred yield which accrued whether earned or declared and was cumulative from the date of issuance of each preferred unit at a rate of 7.5% per annum through September, 2011 and at 15% thereafter. The preferred yield was not declared (or paid) during the period from August 31, 2004 (date of inception) to December 31, 2006. The total preferred yield was approximately $4,990,000 at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, NEP's Board of Managers consisted of five members, comprised as follows: JPMP has four (4) managers and the Majority Common Unit holders have one (1) manager. Option to Purchase Preferred Units In 2005, two Company officers and members were granted options to purchase 1,000 and 2,500 preferred units at $100 per unit. The options carry a three year term (both options will expire in 2008) and neither had been exercised as of December 31, 2007. The Company has not recorded any compensation expense in connection with these options as the fair value of these options is immaterial. Rockfield Noble Holding, LLC During 2007, Rockfield Noble Holding, LLC ("Rockfield") purchased 129,424 Series A preferred units of NEP for $12,942,386. Rockfield's members include preferred and common units holders of NEP as well as officers and directors of NEP.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Sale of Preferred Units: In February 2008, JPMP purchased 400,000 series B preferred units from NEP for $40,000,000. In March 2008, Canadian Pension Plan ("CPP") purchased 1,100,000 series B preferred units from NEP for $110,000,000. C Corporation Election and Conversion: On February 28, 2008, the Company filed an entity classification election with the Internal Revenue Service which changed the tax treatment of the Company from a partnership to a corporation. The election was effective as of January 1, 2008. Letter of Credit Facility: On February 14, 2008, the Company's subsidiary, Noble Credit Funding, LLC ("Noble Credit"), entered into a Master Credit Agreement with RBS Citizens, National Association ("RBS"). The Master Credit Agreement is a revolving letter of credit facility, under which RBS may issue, on behalf of Noble Credit or any of its affiliates, one or more standby letters of credit to third parties, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Master Credit Agreement. The maximum amount of letter of credit obligations that may be outstanding at any time under the Master Credit Agreement is $45.0 million. The Master Credit Agreement expires on February 14, 2010, and all letters of credit issued under the agreement must expire at least ten days prior to such date. Noble Credit is required to cash collateralize 100% of the face value of each letter of credit issued under the Master Credit Agreement. Pursuant to a Pledge and Security Agreement, Noble Credit granted RBS a security interest in any cash collateral, provided that RBS may not foreclose on any cash collateral if such foreclosure would lead to the cancellation of any outstanding letter of credit. In addition, Noble Credit issued to RBS a Revolving Credit Note, under which RBS may demand payment of any fees or expenses payable to RBS if Noble Credit does not pay on a timely basis or if RBS is unable to access the cash collateral after a certain period. Neither Noble Credit's failure to pay any fees or other amounts due under the Master Credit Agreement nor the existence of an obligation under the Revolving Credit Note give RBS the right to cancel any outstanding letter of credit.

Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers Reference is made to Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which enables a corporation in its original certificate of incorporation or an amendment thereto to eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director for violations of the director's fiduciary duty, except (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, which provides for liability of directors for unlawful payments of dividends of unlawful stock purchase or redemptions or (iv) for any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit. Reference is also made to Section 145 of the DGCL, which provides that a corporation may indemnify any person, including an officer or director, who is, or is threatened to be made, party to any threatened, pending or completed legal action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of such corporation, by reason of the fact that such person was an officer, director, employee or agent of such corporation or is or was serving at the request of such corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, provided such officer, director, employee or agent acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the Company's best interest and, for criminal proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. A Delaware corporation may indemnify any officer or director in an action by or in the right of the corporation under the same conditions, except that no indemnification is permitted without judicial approval if the officer or director is adjudged to be liable to the corporation. Where an officer or director is successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action referred to above, the corporation must indemnify him against the expenses that such officer or director actually and reasonably incurred. II-1 Our certificate of incorporation will provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL and must also pay expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon delivery of an undertaking, by or on behalf of an indemnified person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this section or otherwise. The indemnification rights set forth above shall not be exclusive of any other right which an indemnified person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. We expect to maintain standard policies of insurance that provide coverage (i) to our directors and officers against loss rising from claims made by reason of breach of duty or other wrongful act and (ii) to us with respect to indemnification payments that we may make to such directors and officers. The proposed form of Underwriting Agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Registration Statement provides for indemnification to our directors and officers by the underwriters against certain liabilities.

Undertakings Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issues. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that: (i) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (ii) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the Underwriting Agreement, certificates in such denomination and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. II-10 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the Town of Essex, State of Connecticut on May 8, 2008.
