If a swap agreement terminates and the relevant notes do not become immediately due and payable, then the Noteholders in respect of such notes will be subject to exchange rate risk as the issuing entity will exchange GBP amounts for USD at a spot rate of exchange and there is no guarantee that such spot rate of exchange will equal the rate of exchange applicable under the swap agreement. Each swap agreement may be terminated prior to payment in full of the notes Any swap agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events. In the event that a swap agreement is terminated without replacement, an Event of Default will occur under the terms and conditions of the notes. There can be no assurance that a swap agreement will not be terminated prior to the payment in full of the notes of the relevant class. Change in law may result in the imposition of withholding taxes on payments to be made under the swap agreements Each of the issuing entity and the swap counterparty will represent in each swap agreement that, under current applicable law, they are entitled to make all payments required to be made by them under such swap agreement free and clear and without deduction for or on account of, any taxes, assessments or any other charges. In the event that the swap counterparty is required to make any such deduction due to any action taken by a taxing authority, any action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a change in tax law, the swap counterparty will not be required to indemnify the issuing entity for such deduction. As a result, payments to the issuing entity may be reduced. In such circumstances, the issuing entity may as a result of a deduction for or on account of any taxes, assessments or any other charges be entitled to terminate the relevant swap agreement.

However, certain amounts received by the issuing entity will be denominated in sterling. In order to protect the issuing entity against currency exchange rate exposure, the issuing entity and the swap counterparty have entered into a currency swap transaction in relation to each class of notes. Subject to the provisions set out under  Early Termination  below under the terms of each currency swap transaction relating to each class of notes, the issuing entity will pay to the swap counterparty: (a) on or after the issue date, an amount to be paid in respect of the proceeds received by the issuing entity on the issue of the relevant class of notes; (b) on each interest payment date, an amount in sterling determined by reference to applying a floating rate of interest to the relevant currency amount (as determined pursuant to the relevant swap confirmation); and (c) on each date upon which any notes are redeemed pursuant to Condition 7 ( Redemption and Purchase ) of the terms and conditions of the notes, an amount in sterling determined in accordance with the provisions of the relevant swap confirmation. In return, the swap counterparty will be obliged to pay to the issuing entity: (a) on or after the issue date, an amount in sterling calculated by reference to the US dollar proceeds of the issue of the relevant class of notes converted into sterling at the relevant exchange rate as provided in the relevant swap agreement; (b) on each interest payment date, an amount in US dollars determined by reference to applying a fixed or floating rate of interest (as the case may be) to the relevant currency amount; and (c) on each date upon which any notes are redeemed pursuant to Condition 7 ( Redemption and Purchase ) of the terms and conditions of the notes, an amount in US dollars determined in accordance with the provisions of the relevant swap confirmation. To ensure the issuing entitys compliance with its ongoing periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, the issuing entity and the swap counterparty expect to enter into an agreement governing the information concerning the swap counterparty to be included in such periodic reports (the  Disclosure Agreement ). Based on a reasonable good faith estimate of probable exposure, the significance percentage of each swap agreement is [] per cent. Early Termination Each currency swap transaction may be terminated prior to its scheduled termination date in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) subject to the provisions of the swap agreement in respect of such transaction, at the option of the issuing entity, after the expiration of any applicable grace period if there is a failure by the swap counterparty to pay any amounts due under such swap agreement and, at the option of the swap counterparty after the expiration of any applicable grace period, if there is a failure to pay amounts due under the swap agreement by the issuing entity; (b) at the option of the issuing entity, in respect of a rating downgrade with respect to the swap counterparty below the levels specified in the swap agreement relating to such currency swap transaction where the swap counterparty fails to take appropriate action within the requisite time period; (c) at the option of the swap counterparty, pursuant to the occurrence of an Event of Default under Condition 10 of the terms and conditions of the notes and the delivery by the note trustee of an Enforcement Notice; (d) upon the occurrence of certain other events with respect to either party to such currency swap transaction, including but not limited to certain insolvency related events, merger without an assumption of the obligations in respect of the swap agreement, or changes in law resulting in illegality; S-8 Back to Contents (e) in the event that there is a withholding tax imposed, (1) at the option of the swap counterparty in accordance with the provisions of the swap agreement, in relation to the issuing entitys payments under such swap agreement and (2) at the option of the issuing entity in accordance with the provisions of the swap agreement, in relation to such swap counterpartys payments under the swap agreement; (f) at the option of the swap counterparty or the issuing entity (provided that the relevant class of Noteholders in respect of the relevant notes shall first have directed the note trustee by way of extraordinary resolution to terminate the transaction(s) relating to such notes), in the event that there is a withholding tax imposed (1) in relation to the issuing entitys payments under the notes or (2) in relation to any payments to the issuing entity under a medium term note certificate which corresponds to such notes; (g) at the option of the swap counterparty if any amendment and/or supplement is made to the note trust deed, the issuing entity master framework agreement or the terms and conditions of the notes without the swap counterpartys prior written consent, where such amendment and/or supplement would be reasonably expected to result in the swap counterparty being required to pay more or receive less, were it to replace itself as swap counterparty, than it would otherwise have been required to prior to such amendment and/or supplement; and (h) at the option of the swap counterparty, in respect of only the relevant transactions or relevant portions of such transactions that correspond to any notes that may have been redeemed by the issuing entity (as determined by the swap counterparty in consultation with the issuing entity) in circumstances where some or all of a relevant series of notes have been redeemed pursuant to Condition 7(b) ( Mandatory Early Redemption or Mandatory Sale of Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes to the issuing entity ) of the terms and conditions of the notes following the imposition of any requirement on the MTN Issuing Entity to withhold or deduct any amounts for or on account of tax on the payment of any principal or interest in respect of a medium term note certificate of a relevant series. Upon any such early termination of a currency swap transaction, either the issuing entity or the swap counterparty may be liable to make a termination payment to the other. The amount of any such termination payment will be based on the value of the swap computed in accordance with the terms of the swap agreement relating to such currency swap transaction, in the first instance on the basis of market quotations of the cost of entering into a swap transaction with the same terms and conditions that would have the effect of preserving the respective full payment obligations of the parties, in accordance with the procedures set forth in such swap agreement. Any such termination payment may, if interest rates and/or the relevant currency exchange rate had changed significantly, be substantial. Upon termination of a currency swap transaction and the swap agreement relating to such currency swap transaction if no replacement swap transaction has been obtained the security under the Note Trust Deed (and the Note Trust Deed Supplement) in respect of Series 2008-1 will become enforceable. If such security is enforced, the proceeds thereof will be applied in payment of amounts set out under the order of priority of payments set forth in the terms and conditions of the notes of such series. In the event that a swap agreement with respect to a specific class is terminated other than as a result of a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default (as defined below), then any termination payment to be paid to the swap counterparty by the issuing entity in accordance with the early termination provisions of such swap agreement shall rank pari passu with only those payments to be made to the holders of the relevant class of notes to which such swap agreement relates. Events constituting a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default (as defined on page [] of the base prospectus) may result in the early termination of the relevant swap agreement. In the event that a swap agreement is terminated as a result of a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default, then any termination payment to be paid to the swap counterparty by the issuing entity in accordance with the early termination provisions of such swap agreement shall be subordinated to any payments to be made under the relevant notes. The swap counterpartys payment obligations pursuant to the relevant swap agreement are subject to the condition that no event of default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the issuing entity pursuant to the relevant swap agreement. S-9 Back to Contents Taxation Neither the issuing entity nor the swap counterparty is obliged under each swap agreement to gross up if withholding taxes are imposed on payments made under such swap agreement. In the event that any withholding tax is imposed on payments to be made to the issuing entity under any currency swap transaction then the issuing entity may terminate such currency swap transaction and either the issuing entity or the swap counterparty may be required to pay a swap termination payment to the other party. In the event that any withholding tax is imposed on payments to be made by the issuing entity under any currency swap transaction, [the swap counterparty may terminate such currency swap transaction and either the issuing entity or the swap counterparty may be required to pay a swap termination payment to the other party] [ to be confirmed - consider amending Additional Risk Factor for Withholding Tax above ] or the swap counterparty shall be entitled to deduct amounts in the same proportion (as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the confirmation relating to such transaction) from the corresponding payment due from it. In [such event] [the latter scenario], payments on the relevant class will be subject to deferral in proportion to the amount so deducted. In the event that any withholding tax is imposed on payments due by the swap counterparty under a swap agreement, the issuing entity shall not be entitled to deduct corresponding amounts from the corresponding payments due from it and payments on the relevant series will be subject to deferral in proportion to the amount so withheld by the swap counterparty. Pursuant to the provisions of the swap agreements, if on the next date that either party was required to make a payment under a swap agreement, such party would be required by any applicable law or relevant taxing authority or court of competent jurisdiction to withhold any amount from such payment in respect of tax, such party will inform the other party and will use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to, within 20 days after informing the other party, restructure the affected transaction or transfer all its rights and obligations under the relevant swap agreement to another of its offices or affiliates so as to avoid any such requirement to withhold any amount in respect of tax, provided that such party will only effect a transfer or restructuring in accordance with the transfer provisions in the swap agreements. If such party is not able to make such a transfer or restructuring it will give notice to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer or restructuring within 30 days after having being informed of the requirement to withhold, provided that it will only effect a transfer or restructuring in accordance with the transfer provisions in the swap agreements. Any such transfer by either party will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other partys policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed. Any such restructuring by either party will be subject to and conditional upon the confirmation by Standard and Poor's and the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. If neither party is able to arrange the transfer or restructuring, as set out above, the party which is not required to withhold any amount in respect of tax from such payment may terminate the relevant currency swap transaction. Rating Downgrade or Withdrawal If the swap counterparty is downgraded below the ratings specified in the relevant swap agreement (in accordance with the requirements of Standard & Poors and Moodys), or if the rating of the swap counterparty is withdrawn, then the swap counterparty will, in accordance with the provisions of and subject to the timeframes specified in the relevant swap agreement, be required to take certain remedial measures which may include: (a) providing collateral in accordance with a mark to market collateral agreement between the swap counterparty and the issuing entity (the Credit Support Annex, as defined below), (b) obtaining a guarantee from a guarantor that satisfies the requirements specified in the relevant swap agreement, (c) transferring the relevant swap agreement to an entity that satisfies the requirements specified in the relevant swap agreement, or (d) in respect of a downgrade or rating withdrawal by Standard & Poors only, taking such other actions as it may agree with Standard & Poors. In accordance with the requirements of Standard & Poors and Moodys, if the swap counterparty remains a party to the swap agreement and the swap counterparty is subject to further downgrades, then the swap counterparty will be subject to additional, more restrictive requirements. If the swap counterparty is downgraded by Standard & Poors or Moodys and the swap counterparty fails to comply with the applicable ratings downgrade provisions as set out in the relevant swap agreement, the issuing entity may terminate such swap agreement in accordance with the terms of the relevant swap agreement. Where the swap counterparty provides collateral in accordance with the terms of the relevant swap agreement, such collateral will be credited to the issuing entity distribution account and amounts in respect of such collateral may be returned by the issuing entity to the swap counterparty from time to time in accordance with the terms of the swap agreement and the Credit Support Annex. S-10 Back to Contents The swap counterparty may, subject to certain conditions specified in the swap agreement, including certain requirements of Standard & Poors and Moodys, transfer its rights and obligations in respect of the swap agreement to another entity. See  Transfers  below. Credit Support Annex The swap counterparty will enter into a 1995 ISDA Credit Support Annex (Bilateral Form Transfer) with the issuing entity (the  Credit Support Annex ) on or prior to the closing date in support of the swap counterpartys obligations under the swap agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Support Annex, if at any time the swap counterparty is required to provide collateral in respect of any of its obligations under the swap agreement, the Credit Support Annex will provide that, from time to time and subject to the conditions specified in the Credit Support Annex and the swap agreement, the swap counterparty will make transfers of cash or securities by way of collateral to the issuing entity in support of its obligations under the swap agreement and the issuing entity will be obliged to return such collateral in accordance with the terms of the Credit Support Annex. Interest Deferral In certain circumstances payments due to be made by either party under the swap agreement may be deferred and to the extent such payments are deferred interest shall accrue in respect thereof. Transfers Except as stated under  Taxation  above, or as otherwise permitted under each swap agreement and as provided below, neither the issuing entity nor the swap counterparty is permitted to assign, novate or transfer as a whole or in part any of its rights, obligations or interests under such swap agreement. Any transfer by the issuing entity of its interests under a swap agreement to any other entity shall be subject to the consent of the note trustee, Standard & Poors and Moodys. The issuing entity may transfer any interest under a swap agreement to any other entity with the swap counterpartys prior written consent, except that such consent is not required in the case of a transfer, charge or assignment to the note trustee as contemplated in the note trust deed or any note trust deed supplement thereto in relation to a relevant series. The swap counterparty may transfer all its rights and obligations with respect to a swap agreement to any other entity (a  Transferee ) subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to the following: (a) it has given five Business Days prior written notice to the note trustee; (b) the Transferee is an eligible replacement, as defined in the Moodys rating methodology, and the Transferees short-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations are then rated not less than A-1 by Standard & Poors (or its equivalent by any substitute rating agency) or such Transferees obligations under the swap agreement are guaranteed by an entity whose short-term, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations are then rated not less than A-1 by Standard & Poors (or its equivalent by any substitute rating agency) provided that Standard & Poors has had sight of such guarantee; (c) a termination event or an event of default does not occur under the swap agreement as a result of such transfer; (d) the Transferee contracts with the issuing entity on terms that (1) have the same economic effect as the terms of the swap agreement in respect of any obligation (whether absolute or contingent) to make payment or delivery after the effective date of such transfer and (2) insofar as they do not relate to payment or delivery obligations, are, in all material respects, no less beneficial for the issuing entity than the terms of the swap agreement immediately before such transfer; and (e) (if the Transferee is domiciled in a different country from both the swap counterparty and the issuing entity) Standard & Poors has provided prior written notification that the then current ratings of the notes will not be adversely affected.

Notes will be issued in series, each with up to four classes of notes identified, respectively, as class A, class B, class C and class D notes (the class B, class C and class D notes, collectively, the  subordinated notes ).

In the case of each class or sub-class of notes denominated in a currency other than sterling, a separate currency rate swap transaction will be entered into by the issuing entity to convert the sterling amounts received into such other currency for payments to that class or sub-class. Please consider carefully the risk factors beginning on page 21 in this base prospectus before you purchase any notes. The notes will be obligations of the issuing entity only. They will not be obligations of, nor will they be guaranteed by, any other party, including Barclays Bank PLC in any of its capacities, Barclays Capital, Barclays Capital Inc., Barclaycard Funding PLC, Gracechurch Receivables Trustee Limited or any of their affiliates or advisers, successors or assigns. The issuing entity will only have a limited pool of assets to satisfy its obligations on the notes.

In compliance with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ( FSMA ), this base prospectus may not be used to offer any notes more than 12 months after the date of this base prospectus. Application has been made to have any notes issued under the programme during the first 12 months following the date of this prospectus admitted to listing on the Official List of the Financial Services Authority in its capacity as the United Kingdom Listing Authority (the  UKLA ) and to trading on the regulated market of the London Stock Exchange plc (the  London Stock Exchange ).

Arranger Barclays Capital Underwriter Barclays Capital [], 2008 ii Back to Contents You should be aware that it is necessary to consider this base prospectus and any prospectus supplement/final terms in their entirety, and in particular, the following sections:  Risk Factors ,  The Receivables ,  The Receivables Trust ,  Securitisation Cashflows ,  The Medium Term Note Certificate ,  The Note Trust Deed , Servicing of Receivables and Trust Cash Management ,  The Notes ,  Terms and Conditions of the Notes ,  The Swap Agreements ,  Material Legal Aspects of the Receivables  and all sections in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms in order to consider whether the issuing entity holds assets the characteristics of which demonstrate a capacity to service any payments due on the notes issued by the issuing entity. Governing Law The programme documents are governed by the laws of England and Wales and (including specifically where they relate to security interests over assets in Jersey) by Jersey law. The  United Kingdom  and  U.K.  are abbreviated references to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom comprises three distinct legal systems, namely those of England (which includes Wales), Scotland and Northern Ireland, each with its own judicial process. However, leaving aside devolution of certain powers to Scottish and Northern Irish legislative bodies, the legislative body for each of these three jurisdictions is the U.K. Parliament. Accordingly, references to U.K. law are to laws promulgated by the U.K. Parliament but which are binding on the United Kingdom. Provisions of the transaction documents which grant security over certain intangible assets situated in Jersey are, in order to be effective as a matter of Jersey law, governed by Jersey law.  Jersey , an island in the Channel Islands off the coast of France, has an entirely separate legislative and judicial system.

In connection with the issue of any series of notes, the underwriter or underwriters (if any) named as the stabilising manager(s) (or persons acting on behalf of any stabilising manager(s)) in the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms may over allot notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the price of the notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail.

Barclaycard has previously assigned all of its present and future beneficial interest in receivables in designated revolving credit and charge card accounts owned by Barclaycard and opened in the United Kingdom. Only the receivables were assigned. The accounts were retained by Barclaycard. The receivables were assigned to a special purpose company, incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands, acting as receivables trustee. The receivables trustee holds the receivables on trust for Barclaycard, as originator beneficiary and excess interest beneficiary, and a special purpose subsidiary of Barclays called the  MTN issuing entity , as investor beneficiary. Barclaycard may transfer its entitlement to receive excess interest attributable to each series to the MTN issuing entity. The receivables trustee may issue multiple series of investor certificates to the MTN issuing entity. Each series of investor certificates will represent an undivided beneficial interest in the receivables trust. They will entitle the MTN issuing entity to payments of interest and principal payable from collections on the receivables. The MTN issuing entity has funded prior acquisitions and may fund future acquisitions of each undivided beneficial interest in the receivables trust, evidenced by the issuance of each series of investor certificates, by issuing a series of limited recourse medium term note certificates to the issuing entity. The limited recourse nature of the medium term note certificates will ensure that the MTN issuing entity is only ever liable to the purchaser of any series of medium term note certificates for payments in amounts equal to the payments of principal and interest received by the MTN issuing entity from the receivables trustee under the corresponding series of investor certificates. The issuing entity, in turn, will finance the purchase of each series of medium term note certificates by issuing series of notes to investors. 1 Back to Contents STRUCTURAL DIAGRAM OF BARCLAYS BANK PLC SECURITISATION PROGRAMME 2 Back to Contents OVERVIEW OF THE GRACECHURCH CARD PROGRAMME FUNDING LIMITED MEDIUM TERM NOTE PROGRAMME The following overview does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the remainder of this base prospectus and, with respect to a particular series, the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms .

The issuing entity accepts responsibility for the information contained in this document. To the best of the knowledge and belief of the issuing entity, which has taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case, the information contained in this document is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.

The Depositor, MTN Issuing Entity and Initial Investor Beneficiary The depositor, MTN issuing entity and the initial investor beneficiary is Barclaycard Funding PLC, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. Its registered office is located at 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP. Its telephone number is +44 (0)207 116 1000. The MTN issuing entity is a subsidiary of Barclays. The MTN issuing entity was established to issue series of secured limited recourse medium term note certificates from time to time under a programme. The MTN issuing entity becomes an investor beneficiary of the receivables trust in respect of such medium term note certificates. 4 Back to Contents The MTN issuing entity does not have any employees. On 8 April 2003 the MTN issuing entity entered into an agreement with Structured Finance Management Limited, and Barclays Bank PLC among others, under which Structured Finance Management Limited agreed to provide administration services to the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will act as depositor with respect to the medium term note certificates sold to the issuing entity. The Medium Term Note Certificate On the closing date for each series, the MTN issuing entity will sell to the issuing entity one interest bearing, limited recourse medium term note certificate issued as a series under the Barclaycard Funding PLC medium term note programme. Each limited recourse medium term note certificate will be called a  medium term note certificate . Each medium term note certificate is governed by English law and is subject to the English courts in the event of proceedings relating to the medium term note certificate. No approval or notice to holders of the outstanding medium term note certificates is necessary for the issuance of new certificates. The issuing entity will make payments of interest and principal on the class A notes, the class B notes, the class C notes and the class D notes from payments of interest and principal made by the MTN issuing entity on the medium term note certificates, including MTN issuing entity additional interest payments, and from amounts paid by the swap counterparty. The issuing entity will also make payment of the deferred subscription price in respect of the medium term note certificates out of unutilised MTN issuing entity additional interest payments received by it. If an event of default occurs under a medium term note certificate, the security trustee, on behalf of and acting on the instructions of the issuing entity as holder of the medium term note certificate, is entitled to appoint a receiver of the MTN issuing entity who would continue to collect amounts paid on the investor certificate. The security trustee would also be able to sell the investor certificate. In addition, pursuant to the series supplement the security trustee may give an enforcement notice to the MTN issuing entity declaring the medium term note certificate to be immediately due and payable. A declaration that the medium term note certificate has become immediately due and payable will not, of itself, accelerate the timing or amount of redemption of the medium term note certificate. The Security Trustee The security trustee in relation to the MTN issuing entity is The Bank of New York, acting through its London branch, whose principal place of business is at One Canada Square, London E14 5AL, United Kingdom. Its telephone number is +44 (0)207 570 1784. The Bank of New York has served and currently is serving as note trustee, security trustee and trustee for numerous securitisation transactions and programs involving pools of credit card receivables. The security trustee will act as trustee for the holder of the medium term note certificates under the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement. The Receivables The receivables consist of amounts charged by cardholders to designated MasterCard * and VISA * revolving credit and charge card accounts of Barclaycard originated or acquired in the United Kingdom by the sponsor for the acquisition of merchandise, services and cash advances. The receivables also include the periodic finance charges and fees charged to the credit and charge card accounts. As of [] 2008, the aggregate face value of the principal receivables in the securitised portfolio was £[]. The prospectus supplement/final terms in respect of each series of notes will contain more detailed information regarding the composition of the securitised portfolio at the time of the offering of such series. Pursuant to the terms of the receivables securitisation agreement, receivables may be added to the securitised portfolio through the offer to the receivables trustee of present and future receivables relating * MasterCard and VISA are U.S. federally registered servicemarks of MasterCard International Inc. and VISA U.S.A Inc. respectively and are registered trademarks in the United Kingdom of MasterCard International Inc. and VISA International Service Association. 5 Back to Contents to all accounts of a specified product line. In addition, certain breaches of representations, if made by the originator, will obligate the originator to repurchase the affected receivables. The receivables trustee may also offer for sale to the originator receivables relating to a defaulted credit and charge card account. See  The Receivables  Assignment of Receivables to the Receivables Trustee . Specified accounts may be removed and redesignated such that the future receivables generated by a removed and redesignated account would not be transferred to the receivables trust. Defaulted accounts, cancelled accounts and accounts with a zero balance will be redesignated pursuant to the terms of the receivables securitisation agreement. Accounts may also be redesignated at the discretion of the originator. Once redesignated, any receivables generated by such accounts in the future, excepting finance charge receivables related to receivables generated prior to the redesignation, will not be included in the receivables trust. See  The Receivables  Redesignation and Removal of Accounts . If a pay out event occurs, the rapid amortisation period or the regulated amortisation period may begin, which could cause an early redemption of your notes. If Barclaycard as the originator beneficiary or the excess interest beneficiary were to become insolvent, the receivables trustee might be required to liquidate the receivables. The Revolving Period The revolving period for each series is the period from the relevant closing date to the start of the controlled accumulation period (unless delayed) or, if earlier, the start of the rapid amortisation period or the regulated amortisation period. During the revolving period, principal collections calculated as referable to the class A investor interest will be used by the receivables trustee as shared principal collections and, to the extent not used as shared principal collections, to make payments to the originator: (i) to accept new offers of eligible receivables made by the originator to the receivables trustee, and (ii) to make payments to the originator for future receivables assigned by the originator to the receivables trustee by offers that have already been made and accepted. The Initial Originator, Sponsor, Servicer, Trust Cash Manager, MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager and Excess Interest Beneficiary Barclays Bank PLC, sponsor of this programme, originates or acquires the credit and charge card receivables through its business unit, Barclaycard. Barclaycards principal place of business is located at 1234 Pavilion Drive, Northampton NN4 7SG, United Kingdom. Barclaycard is the initial originator and sponsor of the receivables trust and may from time to time purchase portfolios of revolving credit card accounts. Barclaycard has transferred receivables to the receivables trustee prior to the date of this base prospectus and may in the future transfer additional receivables to the receivables trustee. Barclaycard currently services the receivables in the receivables trust. Barclaycard may not resign as servicer, but its appointment as servicer may be terminated and a successor servicer may be appointed in its place if a servicer default occurs. In the future additional originators, if any, may act as co-servicers. Barclaycard was also appointed as the initial trust cash manager to manage the bank accounts of the receivables trustee for each series of investor certificates. Barclaycard may not resign as trust cash manager, but its appointment as trust cash manager may be terminated and a successor trust cash manager may be appointed in its place if a trust cash manager default occurs. In the future additional originators, if any, may act as co-trust cash managers. Barclaycard will be the excess interest beneficiary of the receivables trust, but will transfer its entitlement to the portion of the excess interest attributable to each series to the MTN issuing entity under an agreement between beneficiaries. In return for the transfer of entitlement to the portion of the excess interest attributable to each series, the MTN issuing entity will agree to pay deferred consideration to Barclaycard in an amount equal to the deferred subscription price which the MTN issuing entity receives from the issuing entity in respect of each series medium term note certificate. 6 Back to Contents Barclays Bank PLC has also been appointed as MTN issuing entity cash manager pursuant to the security trust deed and the MTN cash management agreement dated 23 November 1999. The MTN issuing entity cash manager may not resign unless its activities are no longer permissible under the applicable law. No such resignation shall become effective until a successor MTN issuing entity cash manager shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the MTN issuing entity cash manager. Barclays Bank PLC is a bank incorporated in England and Wales and has a long term unsecured debt rating of Aa1 by Moodys and AA by Standard & Poors. Its head office is located at 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP, United Kingdom. It is regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority. Its telephone number is +44 (0)207 116 1000. Barclays Bank PLC is described below under  Barclays Bank PLC . The Receivables Trustee Gracechurch Receivables Trustee Limited, the receivables trustee, is a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands on 29 September 1999. Its registered office is located at 26 New Street, St. Helier, Jersey JE2 3RA. Its telephone number is +44 (0)1534 814814. The shares of the receivables trustee are held by bare nominees for a professional trustee company, Bedell Trustees Limited  not affiliated with Barclays  as trustee on trust for charitable purposes. This means that any profits received by the receivables trustee, after income amounts have been paid in meeting the costs and expenses of the receivables trustee, will be available to be dividended to the trustee for distribution for charitable purposes or to charities exclusively for charitable purposes selected at the discretion of the trustee. The payments on your notes will not be affected by this arrangement. The receivables trustee acts as trustee of the receivables trust. The receivables trustee has been established for the purpose of acquiring credit and charge card receivables of Barclaycard and any additional originators and to hold those receivables and the collections from them on trust for the beneficiaries under the terms of the receivables trust set out in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and to make payments on the investor certificates in accordance with the terms of such agreement as supplemented from time to time. The receivables trustee may issue other series of investor certificates, representing undivided beneficial interests in the receivables trust, from time to time. The receivables trustee may, from time to time, adjust the relative sizes of the undivided beneficial interests in the receivables trust in accordance with the programme documents. The receivables trustee may not engage in any unrelated activities. The Receivables Trust The receivables trust was established on 1 November 1999 under the terms of a declaration of trust under which Barclays and the MTN issuing entity each received an undivided interest in the trust property equal to the proportion of their contributions to the receivables trust. The declaration of trust was amended and restated by a declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement on 23 November 1999. The declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement has been and will be supplemented by series supplements for each series of investor certificates issued from time to time by the receivables trust. The Investor Certificate In connection with each previous series of notes (of which five are outstanding),the depositor and MTN issuing entity paid, and in connection with each series of notes issued under the programme, will pay the proceeds of the medium term note certificate to the receivables trustee to acquire a separate, undivided beneficial interest in the receivables trust. Alternatively, the MTN issuing entity may use such proceeds to repay principal on outstanding medium term note certificates. Each undivided beneficial interest constitutes a new series of the receivables trust and is represented by the investor certificate. The receivables trustee may issue other series of investor certificate(s) from time to time. The MTN issuing entity makes payments of principal and interest on the medium term note certificate from payments of principal and interest received from the receivables trustee on the investor certificate. The payments on the investor certificate are made from payments of principal and interest on the receivables. The receivables trustee is entitled to use the proceeds of the investor certificate paid to it by the MTN issuing entity  together with monies paid to it by the other beneficiaries of the receivables trust  7 Back to Contents to accept an offer by the originator to assign to the receivables trustee the present and future receivables generated by the designated credit and charge card accounts of the originator. The investor certificate entitles the MTN issuing entity to receive payment of a designated portion of collections of the credit and charge card receivables assigned by the originator to the receivables trustee in respect of each series investor certificate. The MTN issuing entity uses those collections for the redemption of the corresponding series medium term note certificate. The investor certificate also entitles the MTN issuing entity to receive its pro rata share of interchange amounts that have been assigned to the receivables trustee. The Swap Counterparty The relevant prospectus supplement/final terms will identify the swap counterparty (if any) for each series or class of notes (referred to herein as the  swap counterparty ). Swap Agreements The notes within a series to be issued by the issuing entity from time to time may be denominated in either sterling, euro, U.S. dollars or other currency as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms and have a fixed or floating rate of interest (as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms). The issuing entity may, in relation to certain classes of notes, enter into an ISDA master agreement and related schedule and confirmations (each, referred to herein as a  swap agreement ) with the relevant swap counterparty. Each prospectus supplement/final terms will provide details of any swap agreement in respect of a class of notes, including the name of the swap counterparty (see  The Swap Agreements ). 8 Back to Contents THE NOTES OVERVIEW The Notes The notes represent assetbacked debt obligations of the issuing entity. The notes are secured by payments received by the issuing entity from the relevant medium term note certificate and payments received from the relevant swap counterparty. The issuing entitys ability to make these payments will ultimately be dependent upon collections Barclaycard receives on the receivables and from the swap counterparty, if any. No approval from or notice to noteholders is required for a new issuance of notes. We will issue the notes under the note trust deed and the relevant series note trust deed supplement. The notes will also be subject to a paying agency and agent bank agreement. The security for the notes will be created under the note trust deed, each series note trust deed supplement and each series pledge agreement between the issuing entity and the note trustee. The terms and conditions of the notes will be contained in the note trust deed. The class B notes will be subordinated to the class A notes. The class C notes will be subordinated to both the class A notes and the class B notes. The class D notes, if a given series is specified as having class D notes, will be subordinated to the class A notes, the class B notes and the class C notes. If there is an event of default under the notes, the note trustee, on your behalf, can appoint a receiver of the issuing entity who would continue to collect amounts paid by the MTN issuing entity under the medium term note certificate. The note trustee would also be able to sell the medium term note certificate. In addition, pursuant to the note trust deed, the note trustee may give an enforcement notice to the issuing entity declaring the notes to be immediately due and payable. A declaration that the notes have become immediately due and payable will not, of itself, accelerate the timing or amount of redemption of the notes. In this base prospectus, we will refer to the owners of interests in the class A notes, the class B notes, the class C notes and the class D notes as the class A noteholders, the class B noteholders, the class C noteholders and the class D noteholders, respectively, and together as the noteholders. Previous Series of Notes Twelve previous series of notes have been issued by 12 previous note issuing entities, Gracechurch Card Funding (No. 1) PLC through Gracechurch Card Funding (No. 11) PLC and Gracechurch Card Notes 2006-A PLC respectively, in relation to the receivables trust.

Any series that remain outstanding on the date of a prospectus supplement/final terms are described in more detail in the section entitled  Other Series of Notes and Medium Term Note Certificates Issued  in such prospectus supplement/final terms. The total principal amount of the interest of the investor beneficiary in a series is called the  investor interest  of that series and reflects that series entitlement to principal receivables. The investor beneficiaries aggregate entitlement under the receivables trust is called the  aggregate investor interest  and comprises the aggregate of each entitlement under each supplement to the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement ( series supplement ). The investor interest of a series is extinguished upon full repayment of that series. The proceeds of the series 99-1 notes were used by Gracechurch Card Funding (No. 1) PLC to purchase, respectively, corresponding series of medium term note certificates issued in three classes, which we shall refer to as the series 99-1 medium term note certificates, issued by the MTN issuing entity.

Clearing Systems Euroclear, Clearstream, DTC and/or, in relation to any series, any other clearing system (each a  clearing system ) as may be specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Status, Security and Priority of Payments of the Notes Each series of notes will be constituted by the note trust deed and by a note trust deed supplement between, among others, the issuing entity and the note trustee (referred to herein as the  series note trust deed supplement ). Within a series, notes of each class will rank pari passu among themselves and rateably without preference or priority among themselves. Each class of notes within a series may be comprised of sub-classes, each denominated in any of sterling, U.S. dollars, euro or any other currency, as specified in the prospectus supplement/final terms. The sub-classes within a class of notes will rank pari passu among themselves and rateably without priority or preference among themselves. As security for the payment of all monies payable in respect of a series, the issuing entity will, pursuant to the note trust deed and the relevant series note trust deed supplement executed in relation to that series, create a first fixe d security interest over, amongst other things, its rights to receive payments under the relevant medium term note certificate (see  Terms and Conditions of the Notes ,  The Medium Term Note Certificate  and  The Note Trust Deed ). 12 Back to Contents For details of the priority of payments with respect to amounts available to the issuing entity, both prior to and post enforcement of the security, see  Securitisation Cashflows  and  Terms and Conditions of the Notes . Amounts available to the issuing entity for payment of interest and repayment of principal on a series will be derived from amounts received by the issuing entity from the MTN issuing entity as payments of interest and principal on the corresponding medium term note certificate (see  The medium term note certificate ). Such payments will, if paid in full, be sufficient for the issuing entity to meet the amounts required (a) to pay the fees, costs and expenses of the issuing entity and the note trustee as herein described, (b) towards payment of amounts due and unpaid on the class A notes, to interest then to principal after having paid any amounts due to the swap counterparty as specified in this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, (c) towards payment of amounts due and unpaid on the class B notes, to interest then to principal after having paid any amounts due to the swap counterparty as specified in this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, (d) to make payments of interest due and unpaid under the terms of the expenses loan agreement, if any, as specified in this base prospectus and relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, (e) towards payment of amounts due and unpaid on the class C notes, to interest then to p rincipal after having paid any amounts due to the swap counterparty as specified in this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, (f) if the series is specified as having class D notes, towards payment of amounts due and unpaid on the class D notes, to interest then to principal after having paid any amounts due to the swap counterparty as specified in this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, (g) to make payments and retentions of principal due and unpaid under the terms of the expenses loan agreement, if any, as specified in this base prospectus and relevant prospectus supplement/final terms and (h) to make other payments required to be made by the issuing entity from time to time as herein described or as further described in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Form of Notes Unless otherwise provided in the relevant series note trust deed supplement, the notes will be issued in registered form. The notes of each class or sub-class will be represented by global note certificates registered in the name of a nominee for Clearstream, Euroclear and/or DTC or any other clearing system as may be specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. We refer to each beneficial interest in a global note certificate as a  book-entry note . A holder of notes may exchange those notes for other notes of the same class of any authorised denominations and of the same aggregate stated principal amount and tenor. Any holder of a note may present that note for registration or transfer, with the form of transfer properly executed, at the office of the relevant registrar that the issuing entity designates. Holders of notes will not be charged any service charge for the exchange or transfer of their notes. Holders of notes that are to be transferred or exchanged will be liable for the payment of any taxes and other governmental charges described in the note trust deed or any series note trust deed supplement thereto before the transfer or exchange will be completed. The relevant registrar will effect a transfer or exchange when it is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the person making the request. No Registration Under Investment Company Act None of the issuing entity, the MTN issuing entity and the receivables trustee have been, nor will they be registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  Investment Company Act ). Currencies Notes of each class or sub-class will be denominated in U.S. dollars, sterling, euro or such other currency, as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Issue Price Notes may be issued at any price as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. 13 Back to Contents Maturities Notes may be issued with any maturity as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Interest Interest will be payable in arrear and accrue at a fixed rate or a floating rate (see  Terms and Conditions of the Notes ) and the method of calculating interest will be specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms for each series of notes. An interest payment date for each series will be specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms but may be subject to change upon the commencement of a rapid amortisation period or regulated amortisation period. Denominations Notes will be issued in such denominations as may be specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of at least $100,000 (or such amount as shall be at least equal to its equivalent in any other currency as at the date of issue of those notes as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms) in the case of any notes which are to be admitted to trading on a regulated market within the European Economic Area or offered to the public in a Member State of the European Economic Area in circumstances which require the publication of a prospectus under the prospectus directive. Negative Covenants The notes will have the benefit of negative covenants of the issuing entity as described in condition 5 (see  Terms and Conditions of the Notes  Negative Covenants of the Issuing Entity ). Credit Enhancement Credit enhancement for a particular series of notes may be provided by a series cash reserve account funded from excess finance charge collections. The amount of cash available to a relevant series will be described in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms for such series (see  Securitisation Cashflows ). Each series of notes is entitled and subject to varying percentages of principal collections and finance charge collections (and losses) in respect of receivables. Any loss not covered by enhancements or credit support will be borne in order of subordination of the different classes and sub-classes of notes among themselves, as described in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Enforcement of Notes in Global Form In the case of each global note certificate in relation to a class, noteholders rights against the issuing entity will be governed by the note trust deed and the series note trust deed supplement which will be entered into by the issuing entity prior to the issuance of each series. Governing Law The notes will be governed by English law. Scheduled Redemption Unless previously purchased and cancelled, each class will be redeemed on the scheduled redemption date as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms to the extent of the amount which has on that day been credited to the relevant distribution ledger in the relevant series issuing entity distribution account, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant medium term note certificate. Optional Early Redemption The issuing entity has the option to redeem all of the remaining notes when their principal balance is reduced to less than 10 per cent. of their original principal balance. If an optional early redemption occurs, you will receive a final distribution equal to the entire unpaid principal balance of your notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 14 Back to Contents Mandatory Early Redemption and Priority of Payments Notes of a particular class may be redeemed before their stated scheduled redemption date upon the commencement of a rapid amortisation period or a regulated amortisation period (see  Terms and Conditions of the Notes ) as further specified in this base prospectus and in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Final Redemption If a series has not been redeemed in full as described in the  Series Scheduled Redemption Date  section of the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, the series will be finally redeemed at its respective principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest by the final redemption date as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Repricing Notes The holder of certain series or classes of notes of a particular series (each a  repricing note ) may also have the benefit of certain repricing arrangements under which Barclays Capital (the  market repricing agent ) in respect of such series or class, and either Barclays Bank PLC or Barclays PLC, as applicable, who will be the initial beneficial noteholder of all repricing notes (the  repricing noteholder ), will enter into an arrangement under which the market repricing agent agrees to determine the then prevailing market interest rate for such series or class of repricing notes of a particular series on any one interest payment date during the term of such notes (such date being a  repricing transfer date ). The repricing notes, if any, will be sold subject to Condition 7(e), which provides for transfer on a repricing transfer date. However, failure by the issuing entity to make or procure an y payment required under Condition 7(e) for reason of any failure on the part of the market repricing agent or the repricing noteholder to perform their respective obligations under the relevant transaction documents shall not constitute an event of default (as defined in Condition 10, ( Events of Default ) under the Conditions. See Condition 7, ( Redemption and Purchase ) and Condition 10 ( Events of Default ). Any series or class of repricing notes will be issued subject to the repricing note transfer arrangements referred to in Condition 7(e) and the applicable market repricing agreement relating to such classes of a particular series (each transfer, a  repricing note transfer ). In order to effect a repricing note transfer in respect of a series or class of repricing notes, the repricing noteholder will enter into a market repricing agreement which will prescribe the mechanics, terms and conditions relating to the market repricing of the related repricing notes of such series or class on the relevant repricing transfer date, prior to the final maturity or earlier redemption in full of such series or class of repricing notes. Market Repricing Agreement Under the terms of an agreement to be dated on or about the issue date in relation to an issuance of a series or class of repricing notes (a  market repricing agreement ) between, inter alios , the market repricing agent, the issuing entity and the repricing noteholder), the repricing noteholder will appoint Barclays Capital to act as the market repricing agent, who will be obliged to, upon request from the repricing noteholder, identify the current market margin applicable to the repricing notes, prior to the occurrence of an repricing termination event (as defined below). Condition 6 ( Interest ) provides for the market repricing agent to have the ability, in order to effect the repricing, to increase or decrease the margin on the applicable series or class of repricing notes from that payable as at the issue date for such series or class in accordance with the applicable market repricing agreement. The market repricing agent will seek bids from investors for the margin to apply to the repricing notes as from the relevant repricing transfer date. If there are one or more investors willing to purchase in aggregate all of the outstanding series and/or class of repricing notes, the margin on all of such series and/or class of repricing notes will be reset to an amount (the  reset margin ) being the lowest margin at which all of such series and/or class of repricing notes will be purchased at par by investors, as determined by the market repricing agent. If all of such series and/or class of repricing notes cannot be placed with investors, the unplaced repricing notes will be retained by the repricing noteholder. If, for any reason, the repricing notes are not transferred on the repricing date the repricing noteholder shall retain the repricing notes at the original margin as set out in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. < /div> The market repricing agent will notify details of the reset margin applicable to a series and/or class of repricing notes to the principal paying agent no later than three business days prior to the relevant repricing transfer date. 15 Back to Contents Notices Any notices that are required to be given by the term of your notes will be deemed to be validly given if they are published in the Financial Times or another leading English language daily newspaper in London. Ratings of the Notes It is a condition to issuing each class of notes that they are on issue to be assigned a rating by each of Standard & Poors Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ( Standard & Poors ), Moodys Investors Service Inc. ( Moodys ) and, if stated in the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms, Fitch Ratings Ltd ( Fitch Ratings , and, together with Standard & Poors and Moodys, the  rating agencies ). For the avoidance of doubt, rating agencies shall only include Fitch Ratings in the event that Fitch Ratings will be providing a rating to the relevant series. The ratings expected to be assigned to each class of notes will be stated in the prospectus supplement/final terms for that series. It is a condition to issuing the class A notes that they be rated the highest rating category by two of the rating agencies, that the class B notes be rated at least A or its equivalent by two of the rating agencies, that the class C notes be rated at least BBB or its equivalent by two of the rating agencies and that the class D notes, if any, be rated at least BB or its equivalent by two of the rating agencies. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Selling Restrictions Any selling restrictions applicable to a series will be as described in the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms. Taxation Payments of interest and principal will be made without making any deductions for any tax imposed by any jurisdiction having power to tax unless a deduction is required by the law of the relevant jurisdiction which has power to tax. If a deduction for tax is made, the paying agent will account to the relevant authority for the amount deducted. Neither the issuing entity nor any paying agent is required to make any additional payments to noteholders for any deductions made for tax.

The summary is subject to finalisation of documents relating to the programme and specifically to each series; and is based on certain assumptions which cannot be verified with respect to any given series before closing of that series: (i) U.S. persons who have no connection with the United Kingdom will not be subject to United Kingdom taxation (other than tax withheld at source as discussed below) in respect of payment of principal and interest on the notes as described more fully in the section of this base prospectus headed  United Kingdom Taxation Treatment of the Notes ; (ii) As described more fully in the section of this base prospectus headed  United Kingdom Taxation Treatment of the Notes , if and for so long as the notes are included in the United Kingdom Official List within the meaning of Part 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange no U.K. withholding in respect of U.K. tax will be required in respect of payments on the notes; if these conditions are not satisfied, U.K. withholding tax at the current rate of 20 per cent. may be required in respect of these payments; (iii) No U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable on the issue of the global notes or on the issue of an individual note certificate. No UK stamp duty reserve tax is payable on the transfer of, or any agreement to transfer, a global note or an individual note certificate. No UK stamp duty is payable on an electronic transfer of a book entry interest in a global note, provided that such transfer is effected without the creation of any written document of transfer or any written agreement for transfer. Under current legislation, UK stamp duty may be payable on any document effecting (i) a transfer of a global note or an individual note certificate, or (ii) a transfer or agreement to transfer an interest in a global note or individual note certificate. If draft legislation contained in Finance Bill 2008 is enacted without material amendment, the charges referred to in (i) and (ii) above may cease to apply as respects any transfer of or agreement to transfer a global note or individual note certificate where the transfer or agreement in question is executed on or after the day on which Finance Act 2008 is passed. However, this new legislation will not apply if the notes do not meet certain conditions. (iv) The MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity will be subject to U.K. corporation tax. So long as the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity respectively are within the application of the Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations 2006 (the  regulations ), their taxable profit for U.K. corporation tax purposes will in each case be based on certain cash amounts retained by each of them respectively in accordance with the application of available funds; (v) In order to fall within the application of the regulations, a company must fulfil certain conditions, including ones which relate to its ongoing asset holdings (e.g. that the assets should be financial assets according to applicable accounting practice at the time of acquisition) and its ongoing cash flow management. These conditions are designed to ensure that the regulations will apply to a company which is genuinely established and operated as a securitisation vehicle in a securitisation of money debts. Provided that the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity are as a matter of fact managed at all times so as to meet the conditions laid down by the regulations, the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity can be expected to fall within the application of the regulations. Investors should note, however, that the regulations are in short form and have only been in force since the beginning of 2007 and the practices of the UK tax authorities in implementing the regulation s are still evolving. It is expected that advisors will rely significantly upon guidance from the UK tax authorities when advising on the scope and operation of the regulations including advising as to whether any particular company falls within the new regime; (vi) The receivables trustee will have no U.K. tax liabilities and accordingly, the receivables trustee will have no liability to U.K. tax in relation to amounts which it receives on behalf of the MTN issuing entity or amounts which it is obliged to pay to the MTN issuing entity; 18 Back to Contents (vii) The above description is based on the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity being resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom. Each of them respectively will be so resident if and for so long as it is, as a matter of fact, centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom. Subject to finalisation of documents, including those relating to the programme and specifically to each series, in a form satisfactory to them and which is not inconsistent with the descriptions in this base prospectus, Clifford Chance LLP, as special U.K. tax advisers, expect to give an opinion at closing by reference to the final documentation and based on certain assumptions listed in that opinion, some of which cannot be verified with respect to any given series before closing of that series and some of which are dependent on ongoing factors, which will cover in detail the matters referred to under this heading  U.K. Tax Status . See  Risk Factors: Taxable Nature of the MTN Issuing Entity or the Issuing Entity Could Cause a Loss on Your Notes . Jersey Tax Status The following summary of the anticipated tax treatment in Jersey of the issuing entity is based on Jersey taxation law and practice in force at the date of this document and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Prospective investors should consult their professional advisers on the implications of subscribing for, buying, holding, selling, redeeming or disposing of notes under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they may be liable to taxation. Prospective investors should be aware that tax rules and practice and their interpretation may change. The issuing entity has been granted exempt company status within the meaning of Article 123A of the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended for the current calendar year. The effect of such special status is that the issuing entity is treated as a non-resident company for the purposes of Jersey tax laws and is therefore exempt from Jersey income tax on its profits arising outside Jersey (and, by concession, on bank deposit interest arising in Jersey) and from any obligation to withhold Jersey income tax from any interest or dividend payments made by it. Such status is applied for on an annual basis (together with payment of the required charge, currently £600). The retention of exempt company status is conditional upon the Comptroller of Income Tax in Jersey being satisfied that no Jersey resident has a beneficial interest in the issuing entity, except as permitted by concessions granted by the Comptroller of Income Tax. As an exempt company, payments in respect of the notes will not be subject to taxation in Jersey, no withholding will be required for or on account of Jersey income tax on such payments to any holder of a note and gains derived from the sale of notes will not be subject to Jersey income tax, in each case in the hands of persons not resident for income tax purposes in Jersey. As at the date of this base prospectus, Jersey has no capital gains tax and no inheritance tax or gift tax. No stamp duty or similar taxes are payable in Jersey in connection with the issue, redemption or sale of the notes. European Union Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income Under EU Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the  EU Savings Tax Directive ), each Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in that other Member State; however, for a transitional period, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg may instead apply a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at rates rising over time to 35%. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain nonEU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments. A number of nonEU countries, and certain dependent or associated territories of certain Member States (including Jersey, as to which see below), have also agreed to adopt similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entities established in a Member State. In addition, the Member States have entered into provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made by a person in a member state to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entities established in one of those territories. 19 Back to Contents Jersey is not subject to the EU Savings Tax Directive. However, in keeping with Jerseys policy of constructive international engagement, the States of Jersey has introduced a retention tax system in respect of payments of interest, or other similar income, made to an individual beneficial owner resident in an EU Member State by a paying agent situate in Jersey (the terms beneficial owner and paying agent are defined in the EU Savings Tax Directive). The retention tax system will apply for a transitional period prior to the implementation of a system of automatic communication to EU Member States of information regarding such payments. The transitional period will end only after all EU Member States apply automatic exchange of information and the EU Member States unanimously agree that the United States of America has committed to exchange of information upon request. During this transitional period, such an individual beneficial owne r resident in an EU Member State will be entitled to request a paying agent not to retain tax from such payments but instead to apply a system by which the details of such payments are communicated to the tax authorities of the EU Member State in which the beneficial owner is resident. Under the implementation of the retention tax system in Jersey the issuing entity will not be obliged to levy retention tax in respect of interest payments made by it to a paying agent. European Union Code of Conduct on Business Taxation On 3 June 2003, the European Union Council of Economic and Finance Ministers reached political agreement on the adoption of a Code of Conduct on Business Taxation (the  Code ). Jersey is not a member of the European Union, however, the Policy & Resources Committee of the States of Jersey has announced that, in keeping with Jerseys policy of constructive international engagement, it intends to propose legislation to replace the Jersey exempt company regime by the beginning of 2009 with a general zero rate of corporate tax. United States Federal Income Tax Status As is further described herein, Clifford Chance U.S. LLP, ( U.S. tax counsel ) is of the opinion that each of the receivables trust, the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. The applicable prospectus supplement/final terms will indicate whether the issuing entity will treat the notes that are offered for sale in the United States (the  U.S. offered notes ) as equity in the issuing entity or as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each holder of a U.S. offered note, by acceptance of such note, will agree to treat such note as either equity in the issuing entity or debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable. If the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms indicates that the U.S. offered notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, although there is no authority addressing the characterisation of securities with terms similar to the U.S. offered notes under current law, and while not free from doubt, U.S. tax counsel, will render an opinion that such notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of U.S. tax counsel is not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the characterisation of the U.S. offered notes as debt would prevail if the issue were challenged by the IRS. Prospective United States holders should consult with their tax advisers as to the effect of a recharacterisation of the U.S. offered notes as equity interests in the issuing entity. U.S. tax counsel has prepared and reviewed the summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations in this base prospectus and renders the U.S. federal income tax opinions contained in this base prospectus. See  Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations . ERISA Considerations for Investors Subject to important considerations described under  Certain ERISA and Other U.S. Considerations  in this base prospectus and unless otherwise stated in an applicable prospectus supplement/final terms, the notes are eligible for purchase by persons investing assets of employee benefit plans or individual retirement accounts. 20 Back to Contents RISK FACTORS The following is a summary of the principal risks in connection with the Gracechurch Card Programme Funding Limited medium term note programme and an investment in the notes issued under such programme. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive. You should carefully consider the following principal risk factors and any additional risk factors set out in the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms before deciding to invest in the notes offered by this base prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms. You May Not Be Able to Sell Your Notes There currently is no secondary market for the notes. The arranger and underwriter expects, but is not obligated, to make a market in the notes. If no secondary market develops, you may not be able to sell your notes prior to maturity. We cannot offer any assurance that one will develop or, if one does develop, that it will continue. In addition, noteholders should be aware of the prevailing and widely reported global credit market conditions (which continue at the date of this base prospectus), whereby there is a general lack of liquidity in the secondary market for instruments similar to the notes. Such lack of liquidity may result in investors suffering losses on the notes in secondary resales even if there is no decline in the performance of the securitised portfolio. The issuing entity cannot predict when these circumstances will change and whether, if and when they do change, there will be a more liquid market for the notes and instruments similar to the notes at that time. Allocations of Charged-Off Receivables Could Reduce Your Payments We anticipate that the servicer will charge off or write off as uncollectible some of the receivables. Each class of investor interest in the receivables trust will be allocated a portion of those charged-off receivables. If the amount of charged-off receivables allocated to the investor interest exceeds the amount of funds available to cover those charge-offs, the investor interest will be reduced. This could cause the holders of the notes to not receive the full amount of principal and interest due to them. Any loss will be borne by the noteholders in the order of subordination of the different classes of notes, with the class D notes (if any) bearing the first losses, followed by the class C notes, then the class B notes and finally the class A notes as further described in this base prospectus and in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. See  Securitisation Cashflows: Defaulted Receivables; Investor Charge-Offs; Barclaycard and the Barclaycard Card Portf olio: Delinquency and Loss Experience.  The Issuing Entitys Ability to Meet its Obligations on Your Notes Depends on Payments Under the Relevant Medium Term Note Certificate The ability of the issuing entity to pay the principal of and interest on your notes will depend on the receipt by it of payments under the relevant medium term note certificate issued by the MTN issuing entity. The issuing entity will be entitled to receive interest payments under the relevant medium term note certificate for each series which will be applied (i) to pay the fees, costs and expenses of the issuing entity and the note trustee, (ii) to meet its obligations to pay interest on the notes to noteholders (either directly or indirectly via payments made to and received from swap counterparties), (iii) to make any necessary payments to a swap counterparty, (iv) to pay amounts representing the earnings for the issuing entity, and (v) to meet any other payments required to be made by the issuing entity. Additionally, the issuing entity will be entitled to receive certain principal payments under the relevant medium term note certificate which will be applied in redeeming the notes (either directly or indirectly via payments made to and received from any swap counterparty). 21 Back to Contents If the issuing entity fails to receive sufficient funds under the relevant series medium term note certificate, then the payment of interest and/or the repayment of principal on your notes may be delayed or reduced. The issuing entitys receipt of sufficient funds under the relevant medium term note certificate to pay the amounts due and to repay the entire principal amount of the notes will be dependent on, amongst other things: (i) payments actually being made by cardholders (from whom no security has been taken in support of those payments) and the proceeds of any relevant guarantees or insurance policies in respect of cardholders (to the extent such are capable of assignment), (ii) those payments being collected by the servicer in accordance with the provisions of the beneficiaries servicing agreement and paid to the receivables trustee, (iii) distribution being made by the receivables trustee to the MTN issuing entity of amounts allocable to the MTN issuing entity in accordance with the beneficiaries servicing agreement in respect of the relevant medium term note certificate, (iv) payment being made by the relevant swap counterparty, if any, in respect of its obligations to the issuing ent ity under the swap agreements (if any), and (v) payment being made by the MTN issuing entity in respect of its obligations to the issuing entity under the relevant medium term note certificate. Amounts paid to the issuing entity by the MTN issuing entity in respect of each medium term note certificate will be used to pay principal and interest on the notes of the corresponding series in accordance with the terms and conditions for that series (subject to payment of amounts for fees, costs and expenses of the issuing entity and amounts representing issuing entity profit). The Subordinated Notes Bear Additional Risk Because They Are Subject to the Prior Payment of Amounts due on Notes Senior to them. The class B notes are subordinated in right of payment of principal and interest to the class A notes in the same series. Principal payments to the class B noteholders will not be made until the class A noteholders are paid in full. On each payment date interest is paid to the class A noteholders before payments of interest are made to the class B noteholders. This could cause the class B noteholders not to receive the full amount of principal or interest due to them. The class C notes are subordinated in right of payment of principal and interest to the class A notes and the class B notes in the same series. Principal payments to the class C noteholders will not be made until the class A noteholders and the class B noteholders are paid in full. On each payment date interest is paid to the class A noteholders and the class B noteholders before payments of interest are made to the class C noteholders. This could cause the class C noteholders not to receive the full amount of principal or interest due to them. The class D notes are subordinated in right of payment of principal and interest to the class A notes, the class B notes and the class C notes in the same series. Principal payments to the class D noteholders will not be made until the class A noteholders, the class B noteholders and the class C noteholders are paid in full. On each payment date interest is paid to the class A noteholders, the class B noteholders and the class C noteholders before payments of interest are made to the class D noteholders. This could cause the class D noteholders not to receive the full amount of principal or interest due to them. 22 Back to Contents The Issuing Entity has Limited Operating History The issuing entity has no operating history and no experience with the issuance of notes representing asset-backed debt obligations. As a recently incorporated special-purpose vehicle, the issuing entity will be subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that it will not achieve its investment objective and that the value of a noteholders investment could decline substantially. The issuing entity will not engage in any activities which are not related to the issue of the notes. Inability of Noteholders to Receive the Full Percentage Allocation of Principal Collections During the Regulated Amortisation Period Could Delay Payments on Your Notes or Cause a Loss on Your Notes Some series pay out events with respect to a series of notes issued under this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms will cause the start of the regulated amortisation period rather than the rapid amortisation period. During a regulated amortisation period, not all of the principal collections allocated to the investor interest may be used to make payments of principal to the MTN issuing entity as they would be during a rapid amortisation period. Instead, principal payments to the MTN issuing entity  and thus ultimately on your notes  will be limited to the controlled deposit amount. This could cause you to receive payments of principal more slowly than you would during a rapid amortisation period. Since some of the series pay out events, which are described below in  Securitisation Cashflows  Series Pay Out Events , that result in the start of a regulated amortisation period are caused by a deterioration in the performance of the receivables, a delay in the principal payments on your notes could expose you to an increased risk of losses on your notes or a delay in payment on your notes. Grouping of the MTN Issuing Entity with Barclays for Tax Purposes Could Jeopardise the Bankruptcy Remote Status of the MTN Issuing Entity Causing an Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Loss on Your Notes Contractual provisions are contained in the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement and the other agreements to which the MTN issuing entity is a party by which the other parties to those agreements agree not to take any actions against the MTN issuing entity that might lead to its bankruptcy. Furthermore, the MTN issuing entity is contractually restricted from undertaking any business other than in connection with the financings described in this base prospectus. In particular, the MTN issuing entity is expressly prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness, having any employees, owning any premises and establishing or acquiring any subsidiaries. Together, these provisions ensure that the likelihood of the MTN issuing entity becoming insolvent or bankrupt is remote. Notwithstanding the steps that have been and may be taken to ensure that the insolvency of the MTN issuing entity will be remote, the MTN issuing entity is included in the Barclays Group registration for VAT purposes. As a company included in that group registration, broadly, it will be liable, on a joint and several basis with all other companies in the VAT group registration, for the VAT liability of the representative member of the VAT group  Barclays Bank PLC  arising only during the MTN issuing entitys period of membership. Accordingly, these secondary liabilities for VAT could increase the likelihood of the MTN issuing entity becoming insolvent. In addition, there are provisions in the U.K. tax code that are designed to enable HMRC to collect corporation tax from one member of a group where another member of the group has failed to discharge certain taxes due and payable by it within a specified time period. If the MTN issuing entity were required to pay any VAT due from the representative member of the Barclays VAT group or were to become liable for corporation tax liabilities of another member of the Barclays Group, which the MTN issuing entity was unable to meet, HMRC could seek to put the MTN issuing entity into insolvency. This could cause an early redemption of your notes or a loss on your notes. 23 Back to Contents Issuance of Additional Series of Medium Term Note Certificates May Adversely Affect Your Rights by Diluting Your Voting Power The MTN issuing entity has issued twelve previous series of medium term note certificates (of which five remain outstanding as series 99-1 was repaid in November 2002, series 02-1 in October 2007, series 03-1 in March 2008, series 03-2 in June 2006, series 03-3 in August 2006, series 04-1 in February 2007 and series 04-2 in November 2007) and may issue additional series of medium term note certificates in connection with the issuance of other series of investor certificates. The holder of the medium term note certificates of each series  including the issuing entity  may require the MTN issuing entity, as investor beneficiary, to take action or direct actions to be taken under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement or a supplement. However, the consent or approval of holders of a percentage of the total principal balance of the medium term note certificates of all series might be necessary to require or direct those actions. These actions include termina ting the appointment of the servicer under the beneficiaries servicing agreement or the trust cash manager under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement. Thus, the holder of any new series of medium term note certificates will have voting rights that will reduce the percentage interest of the issuing entity as holder of the medium term note certificate. Holders of medium term note certificates of other series  or persons with the power to direct their actions  may have interests that do not coincide with the interests of the issuing entity  or the persons with the power to direct the issuing entity. This may restrict your ability to ultimately direct the MTN issuing entity to take the actions referred to above. The Issuance of Additional Series of Notes from Time to Time May, in Certain Circumstances, Adversely Affect Your Rights by Diluting Your Voting Power The issuing entity may issue additional series of notes from time to time. Noteholders of a given series may be entitled to instruct the note trustee to enforce their rights against the issuing entity. Under the note trust deed, the giving of some instructions to the note trustee may only necessitate the vote of the noteholders of one particular series. However, the giving of other instructions to the note trustee may require the consent or approval of a percentage of the noteholders of all outstanding series of notes. Thus, under the latter scenario, the issuance of future series that will be entitled to vote together with pre-existing series will dilute the voting power of holders of those pre-existing series. Insolvency of the Originator May Result in an Inability to Repurchase Receivables None of the MTN issuing entity, the receivables trustee, the issuing entity or the underwriter has undertaken or will undertake any investigations, searches or other actions to verify the details of the receivables  other than steps taken by the issuing entity to verify the details of the receivables that are presented in this base prospectus or any prospectus supplement/final terms  or to establish the creditworthiness of any cardholder on the designated accounts. The MTN issuing entity, receivables trustee and the issuing entity will rely solely on the representations given by the originator to the receivables trustee about the receivables, the cardholders on the designated accounts, the designated accounts and the effect of the assignment of the receivables. If any representation made by the originator about the receivables proves to have been incorrect when made, the originator will be required to repurchase the affected receivables from the receivables trustee. If the originator becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the receivables trustee may be unable to compel the originator to repurchase receivables, and you could incur a loss on your notes or an early redemption of your notes. 24 Back to Contents Insolvency of the Issuing Entity, the MTN Issuing Entity or the Receivables Trustee Could Cause an Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Loss on Your Notes The ability of each of the issuing entity, the MTN issuing entity and the receivables trustee to meet its obligations under the notes, the medium term note certificate and the receivables securitisation agreement and the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement will depend upon their continued solvency. A company that has assets in the United Kingdom will be insolvent if its liabilities exceed its assets or if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Each of the issuing entity, the MTN issuing entity and the receivables trustee have been structured so that the likelihood of their becoming insolvent is remote. Each of these entities is contractually restricted from undertaking any business other than in connection with the financings described in this base prospectus. They each are expressly prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness, having any employees, owning any premises and establishing or acquiring any subsidiaries. Contractual provisions are contained in each of the agreements to which each of these entities is a party which will prohibit the other parties to those agreements from taking any actions against these entities that might lead to their insolvency. Together, these provisions help ensure that the likelihood of any of these entities becoming insolvent or bankrupt is remote. Notwithstanding these actions, it is still possible that the issuing entity, the MTN issuing entity or the receivables trustee could become insolvent. If this were to occur, you could suffer a loss on your notes or an early redemption of your notes. Application of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, as Amended by the Consumer Credit Act 2006 and Other Legislation May Impede Collection Efforts and Could Cause Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Loss on Your Notes There is an increasing volume of legislation that is applicable to consumer credit in the United Kingdom. In addition, there are proposals to amend existing legislation. Of particular importance are the Consumer Credit Act 1974, as amended by the Consumer Credit Act 2006 (the  Consumer Credit Act ) and the related Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 and Consumer Credit (Cancellation Notices and Copies of Documents) Regulations 1983, as amended (the  regulations ). The Consumer Credit Act and regulations are administered by, amongst others, the Office of Fair Trading (the  OFT ). The Consumer Credit Act and regulations apply, in whole or in part, to the transactions occurring on the designated accounts and to the credit or charge card agreements. The effect of the application of the Consumer Credit Act and the regulations on the relevant underlying credit or charge card agreements may result in adverse consequences for you r investment in the notes, because of the possible unenforceability of, or possible liabilities for misrepresentation or breach of contract in relation to, an underlying credit or charge card agreement. As is common with many other U.K. credit card issuers, some of Barclaycards credit and charge card agreements do not comply in all respects with the Consumer Credit Act, the regulations or other related legislation. In addition, Barclaycard, in common with many other U.K. credit card issuers, has received and expects to continue to receive correspondence from and to have discussions with, the OFT in relation to concerns the OFT may raise from time to time in respect of compliance of Barclaycards credit and charge card agreements with the Consumer Credit Act, the regulations or other related legislation, or any other concerns that the OFT may have in respect of Barclaycards credit and charge card agreements or Barclaycards advertising, marketing or administration thereof. 25 Back to Contents If a credit or charge card agreement has not been executed or modified in accordance with the Consumer Credit Act, it may be unenforceable against a cardholder without a court order. The originator gives no guarantee that a court order could be obtained if required. The Consumer Credit Act has been amended by the introduction of a concept of an unfair relationship from April 2007. If a lender is found to have conducted such a relationship with a borrower, the borrower may apply to the court for the waiver of its debts to the lender and the court has jurisdiction to waive the repayment obligation. With respect to those credit or charge card agreements which may not be compliant, such that a court order enforcing such agreement could not be obtained, the originator estimates that this would apply to less than 1 per cent. of the aggregate principal receivables in the designated accounts on 31 December 2007. Barclaycard does not anticipate any material increase in the percentage of these receivables in the securitised portfolio. In respect of those accounts that do not comply with the Consumer Credit Act it will still be possible to collect payments and seek arrears from cardholders who are falling behind with their payments. The originator will have no obligation to repay or account to a cardholder for any payments received by a cardholder because of this non compliance with the Consumer Credit Act. However, if losses arise on these accounts, they will be written off and borne by the investor beneficiary and originator beneficiary based on their interests in the receivables trust. A ccordingly, if this were to occur, you could suffer a loss on your notes or an early redemption on your notes. Transactions involving the use of a credit card may constitute transactions under debtor creditor supplier agreements for the purposes of the creditors liability under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. A debtor creditor supplier agreement includes an agreement by which the creditor, with knowledge of its purpose, advances funds to finance the debtors purchase of goods or services from a supplier. Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act provides that if a supplier breaches a contract between the supplier and a cardholder in a transaction under certain debtor creditor supplier agreements, or if the supplier makes a misrepresentation about the contract, the creditor may also be liable to the cardholder for the breach or misrepresentation. An example of a suppliers breach of contract would include the supplier selling the cardholder merchandise that is defective or unsuitable for its purpose. In these circumstances, the cardholder may have the right to reduce the amount owed to the originator under his or her credit or charge card account. This right would survive the sale of the receivables to the receivables trustee. As a result, the receivables trustee may not receive the full amount otherwise owed by a cardholder. However, the creditor will not be liable where the cash price of the item or service supplied underlying the claim is £100 or less, or greater than £30,000. The receivables trustee has agreed on a limited recourse basis to indemnify the originator for any loss suffered by the originator from a cardholder claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This indemnity cannot exceed the original outstanding principal balance of the affected charges on a designated account. The receivables trustees indemnity will be payable only from and to the extent of excess spread on the receivables. Any amounts that the originator recovers from the supplier will reduce the originators loss 26 Back to Contents for purposes of the receivables trustees indemnity. This is described under  Securitisation Cashflows: Aggregate Investor Indemnity Amount . The originator will have rights of indemnity against suppliers under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. The originator may also be able to charge back the transaction in dispute to the supplier under the operating regulations of VISA or MasterCard. If the originators loss for purposes of the receivables trustees indemnity exceeds the excess spread available to satisfy the loss, the originator interest in the receivables trust will be reduced by the amount of the excess loss. Satisfaction by the receivables trustee of any such indemnity payment (as described above) could have the effect of reducing or eliminating excess spread which might otherwise have been available to the MTN issuing entity. These consequences could result in you incurring a loss on your investment or an early redemption of your notes. Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) White Paper Dated December 2003 in Connection with its Review of Consumer Credit In its white paper dated December 2003, the DTI, which is the U.K. government department responsible for consumer credit (now the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( BERR )) indicated that the government proposed to take various actions to address matters of concern to it in this area. Since then a number of changes have been made by subordinate legislation under the Consumer Credit Act and further legislative changes are coming into effect in October 2008. Consumer Credit Regulations and the Advertisements Regulations Could Cause Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Loss on Your Notes Two sets of regulations that are particularly pertinent to Barclaycard were made during 2004 pursuant to the Consumer Credit Act. The Consumer Credit (Advertisements) Regulations 2004 ( advertisements regulations ) were made in June 2004 and came into force on 31 October 2004. They replace regulations made in the period 1989 2000 in relation to the advertising of consumer credit. The Consumer Credit (Agreements) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 ( agreements regulations ) were made in June 2004 and came into force on 31 May 2005. The advertisements regulations contain a new statutory regime governing the content of marketing materials that promote consumer credit. The advertisements regulations require every credit advertisement to be made in plain and intelligible language, be easily legible or clearly audible as the case may require and specify the name of the advertiser. The advertisements regulations prescribe information that has to be included in a cred it advertisement. In addition, the advertisements regulations provide certain assumptions which must be applied when calculating a total charge for credit and prescribe the manner in which the total charge for credit and any stated annual percentage rate must be disclosed. The possible unenforceability of, or possible liabilities for misrepresentation or breach of contract, in relation to an underlying credit or charge card agreement may result in unrecoverable losses on accounts to which such agreements apply. If losses arise on these accounts, they will be written off and borne by the investor beneficiary and originator beneficiary based on their interests in the receivables trust. Accordingly, if this were to occur, you could suffer a loss on your notes or an early redemption on your notes. The Agreements Regulations Could Cause Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Loss on Your Notes The agreements regulations amend the Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983 ( 1983 regulations ). The agreements regulations set out the order in which the prescribed content of documents comprising a credit or charge card agreement (including any variations to such agreements which create a 27 Back to Contents modifying agreement under section 82(3) of the Consumer Credit Act) is to be given and the place of the signature and separate boxes required under the 1983 regulations and the agreements regulations. An additional form of consent is required by the agreements regulations where a cardholder purchases certain insurance products on credit. In common with the advertisements regulations, the agreements regulations contain new prominence and legibility requirements and new requirements in relation to the calculation and description of an annual percentage rate. The possible unenforceability of, or possible liabilities for misrepresentation or breach of contract, in relation to an underlying credit or charge card agreement may result in unrecoverable losses on accounts to which such agreements apply. If losses arise on these accounts, they will be written off and borne by the investor beneficiary and originator beneficiary based on their interests in the receivables trust. Accordingly, if this were to occur, you could suffer a loss on your notes or an early redemption on your notes. Consumer Credit Provisions Could Cause Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Loss on Your Notes An Act to amend the Consumer Credit Act (the  Consumer Credit Act 2006 ) became law in March 2006. The provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 2006 and related implementing regulations are coming into effect between June 2006 and October 2008. The Consumer Credit Act 2006 will, when implemented, inter alia , give effect in the Consumer Credit Act to a concept of an unfair relationship. This appears to be a broad concept. A court would be entitled to look at any aspect of a credit relationship in order to determine whether unfairness to the debtor exists. Under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 amendments, remedies would include requiring the creditor to pay back sums to the debtor that had previously been paid by the debtor to the creditor. These provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 2006 amendments are intended to apply to all credit agreements regardless of when entered into with the exception of agreements made before the commencement of the provisions and which are completed before the end of any transitional period which is specified. The Consumer Credit Act 2006 will also extend the ombudsman scheme under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to licensees under the Consumer Credit Act. The extension of the ombudsman scheme will allow a cardholder who has a complaint to raise it with the ombudsman, provided that the complaint falls within the consumer credit jurisdiction conferred upon the ombudsman. The possible unenforceability of, or possible liabilities for misrepresentation or breach of contract, in relation to an underlying credit or charge card agreement may result in unrecoverable losses on accounts to which such agreements apply. If losses arise on these accounts, they will be written off and borne by the investor beneficiary and originator beneficiary based on their interests in the receivables trust. Accordingly, if this were to occur, you could suffer a loss on your notes or an early redemption on your notes. Second EU Directive Relating to Consumer Credit The 1987 directive on consumer credit established the community framework for consumer credit with a view to promoting the setting-up of a common market for credit and establishing minimum community rules to protect consumers. Following a review of the legislation in 2002, the commission concluded that the directive no longer reflected the current situation on the consumer credit market and was in need of revision 28 Back to Contents In May 2007, an agreement was reached at a meeting of the Competitiveness (Internal Market Industry and Research) Council (an adjunct of the European Council of Ministers), concerning a proposal for a second EU directive relating to consumer credit. It was agreed that this new EU directive should provide for the adoption of common provisions for consumer credit documentation in all EU member states. As such, it will constitute a substantial piece of harmonisation in the single European market for retail financial services. On 16 January 2008 the European Parliament approved a common position for the repeal of the 1987 directive and the adoption of a new consumer credit directive. The five key issues of the directive are (i) advertising; (ii) pre-contractual information; (iii) contractual information; (iv) APR; and (v) right of withdrawal. The directive will not apply to credit agreements involving a total amount of credit less than 200 or more than 75,000. The total amount of credit being the ceiling or the total sums made available under the agreement. Additionally, credit agreements covering the granting of credit secured on land or made to finance the acquisition or retention of property rights in land or an existing or projected building would also be excluded. The directive was adopted on 7 April 2008 by the Council of the European Union and will be formally adopted when it is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, at which point each Member State will have two years to i mplement the directive into national law. EU Directive Concerning Unfair Commercial Practices Could Cause Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Loss on Your Notes In May 2005, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a directive on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices (the Unfair Practices Directive ). The directive is of general application and is not confined to consumer credit or other financial services. The Unfair Practices Directive provides that enforcement bodies may take administrative action or legal proceedings against a commercial practice on the basis that it is  unfair  within the directive. The directive is intended to achieve a high level of consumer protection across the EU through harmonization of relevant EU laws. The directive has a substantial focus on advertising and sales promotion practices. Any such changes might have an adverse impact on the ability of credit and charge card issuing entities, such as Barclaycard, to promote their products and services. In May 2007 the BERR announced that the directive would be implemented through the Consumer Protection from Unfair Practices Regulations (the  CPR ). On 3 March 2008, the draft CPR were laid before Parliament and are expected to come into force on 26 May 2008. If enacted in their present form, the CPR would prohibit certain practices deemed unfair by the CPR. Whilst a breach of the CPR does not, of itself, render an agreement void or unenforceable by reason only of a breach of the CPR, the possible liabilities for misrepresentation or breach of contract, in relation to an underlying credit or charge card agreement, may result in unrecoverable losses on accounts to which such agreements apply. If losses arise on these accounts, they will be written off and borne by the investor beneficiary and originator beneficiary based on their interests in the receivables trust. Accordingly, if this were to occur, you could suffer a loss on your notes or an early redemption on your notes. Change of law  Payment Services Directive The Payment Services Directive ( PSD ) is part of the EUs planned Single European Payments Area which is intended to harmonise and remove legal barriers for payments throughout the EU. The PSD must 29 Back to Contents be transposed into legislation by EU Member States no later than 1 November 2009. The PSD sets out conduct of business requirements which may, in practice, operate to require changes to the terms and conditions applying to the Receivables and operational requirements. Failure to Notify Cardholders of the Transfer of Receivables Could Delay or Reduce Payments on Your Notes The transfer by the originator to the receivables trustee of the benefit of the receivables is governed by English law and does not give the receivables trustee full legal title to the receivables. Notice to the cardholders of the transfer would perfect the legal title of the receivables trustee to the receivables. No notice has been given to cardholders of any transfers previously effected, and no notice is expected to be given to the cardholders of any future transfers of receivables to the receivables trustee. The receivables trustee has agreed that notice of the transfer will not be given to cardholders unless the originators long term senior unsecured indebtedness as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch Ratings (if Fitch Ratings is then rating a series of notes) were to fall below Baa2, BBB or BBB, respectively. The lack of notice has several legal consequences that could delay or reduce payments on your notes. Until notice is given to a cardholder and, where necessary, a legal transfer of the receivable is made, the cardholder will discharge his or her obligation under the designated account by making payment to the originator. Prior to the insolvency of the originator, unless notice was given to a cardholder who is a depositor or other creditor of the originator, equitable set offs may accrue in favour of the cardholder against his or her obligation to make payments to the originator under the designated account. These rights may result in the receivables trustee receiving reduced payments on the receivables. The transfer of the benefit of any receivables to the receivables trustee will continue to be subject both to any prior equities that a cardholder had and to any equities the cardholder may become entitled to after the transfer. Where notice of the transfer is given to a cardholder, however, some rights of set off may not arise after the date notice is given. Failure to give notice to the cardholder means that the receivables trustee would not take priority over any interest of a later encumbrancer or transferee of the originators rights who has no notice of the transfer to the receivables trustee where such later encumbrancer or transferee gives notice. This could lead to a loss on your notes. Failure to give notice to the cardholder also means that the originator or the cardholder can amend the card agreement without obtaining the receivables trustees consent. This could adversely affect the receivables trustees interest in the receivables, which could lead to a loss on your notes. Competition in the U.K. Credit Card Industry Could Lead to Early Redemption of Your Notes The credit and charge card industry in the United Kingdom is highly competitive. There is increased competitive use of advertising, target marketing and pricing competition in interest rates and cardholder fees as both traditional and new card issuing entities seek to expand their presence in or enter the U.K. market and compete for customers. New card issuers may rely on customer loyalty and may have particular ways of reaching and attracting customers. For example, major supermarket retailers are promoting the use of their own cards through extensive in store campaigns and low introductory interest rates ( teaser rates ). Also, in the last few years a number of new card issuing entities have entered the U.K. market from the United 30 Back to Contents States and have sought to build market share primarily through aggressive pricing. As a result of this competition, certain competitors offer cards to selected customers with various cost reducing features or at lower interest rates than those offered by Barclaycard. This competitive environment may affect the originators ability to originate new accounts and generate new receivables and may also affect the level of retention of existing accounts. Some of the recently originated or acquired accounts in the bank portfolio of the originator were originated with the use of teaser rates. Such accounts are more susceptible to attrition upon expiration of the teaser rate (i.e. at repricing) than accounts originated without a teaser rate. Recently, market attrition rates for such accounts have been increasing. If the rate at which new receivables are generated declines significantly and if the originator is unable to nominate additional accounts or product lines for the receivables trust, a pay out event could occur with respect to any series of notes issued under this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Such a pay out event could result in an early redemption of your notes. Social, Legal, Political and Economic Factors Affect Credit Card Payments and Are Unpredictable Changes in card use, payment patterns, amounts of yield on the card portfolio generally and the rate of defaults by cardholders may result from a variety of social, legal, political and economic factors in the United Kingdom. Social factors include changes in public confidence levels, attitudes toward incurring debt and perception of the use of credit and charge cards. Economic factors include the rate of inflation, the unemployment rate and relative interest rates offered for various types of loans. Political factors include lobbying from interest groups, such as consumers and retailers, and government initiatives in consumer and related affairs. There is currently significant political interest in the consumer credit market and, in particular, credit cards. The OFT in 2003 commenced an investigation into the levels of default charges applied by several credit card lenders, including Barclaycard. With effect from 1 August 2006, Barclaycard introduced a default charge fee of £12, in line with the OFTs public statement in April 2006 of what the OFT considered to be a reasonable amount for a default charge. We are unable to determine and have no basis on which to predict accurately whether, or to what extent, social, legal, political or economic factors, including the above-noted OFT investigation and correspondence, will affect the future use of credit, default rates, the yield on the card portfolio generally or cardholder repayment patterns. In addition, in September 2005 the OFT received a super-complaint from the Citizens Advice Bureau relating to payment protection insurance ( PPI ). As a result of its inquiries, the OFT commenced a market study on PPI in April 2006. In October 2006, the OFT announced the outcome of the market study and, following a period of consultation, the OFT referred the PPI market to the UK Competition Commission for an in-depth inquiry in February 2007. This inquiry could last for up to two years. Also in October 2006, the FSA published its report on the second stage of its thematic review of PPI sales practices in which it concluded that some firms fail to treat customers fairly. As a consequence of the review, the FSA incorporated specific rules in relation to PPI within its new conduct of business rules sourcebook (ICOBS) published in January 2008 and continues to undertake further thematic work. We are unable to determine and have no basis on which to predict accurately whether, or to what extent, any subsequent action by the OFT in respect of payment protection insurance would affect the card portfolio generally or cardholder repayment patterns. 31 Back to Contents Reduction in the Rate of Interchange Caused by Potential Adverse Regulatory Rulings May Adversely Affect Payments on Your Notes Barclaycard receives fees called "interchange" from the banks that clear transactions for merchants as partial compensation for amongst other things, taking credit risk and absorbing fraud losses. See  The Receivables.  The OFT has been conducting an examination of whether the rates of interchange paid by retailers in respect of MasterCard credit and charge cards in the United Kingdom are too high. In connection with this investigation, the OFT announced in September 2005 a decision with respect to an agreement (which had been terminated by mutual consent of the parties to that agreement in November 2004) regarding the rate of interchange for MasterCard credit and charge cards. The OFTs decision indicated that the agreement constituted an unlawful collective agreement on price with respect to the level of interchange fees, and also stated that the agreement resulted in the unjustified recovery of certain costs. In June 2006, the Competition Appeals Tribunal, with the consent of the OFT, set aside the OFTs September 2005 decision. The OFT has subsequently launched a new investigation into the agreement that has replaced the agreement terminated in November 2004 and which is currently in e ffect with respect to rates of interchange to be paid in respect of MasterCard credit cards and charge cards. If an OFT decision similar to that originally reached regarding the old agreement is reached with respect to the current agreement, or if agreement is reached on a lower rate of interchange, such decision or agreement will adversely affect the yield on UK credit card portfolios. The OFT had previously also commenced an investigation into the rates of interchange in respect of VISA cards and issued a statement of objections. This was withdrawn at the same time the original OFT decision was set aside by the Competition Appeals tribunal in the MasterCard case. The OFT has, as with MasterCard, commenced a further investigation into the rates of interchange on VISA cards. The European Commission issued a decision on 24 July 2002 concluding that an examination of the level of cross-border interchange within the European Union in respect of VISA credit and charge cards was too high and required VISA to undertake a phased reduction in the rate of interchange to be paid by retailers in the future. It was reported in February 2007 that the EU Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, indicated that the Commission will look again at interchange fees charged by VISA in 2008, after the expiration of the "antitrust exemption" agreement at the end of December 2007. Under the 2002 deal, VISA agreed to reduce levels of interchange fees for processing card transactions by the end of 2007. A similar arrangement was not reached with MasterCard, and on 19 December 2007, the European Commission adopted a decision that MasterCards multilateral interchange fees for cross-border payment card transactions with MasterCard and Maestro branded debit and consumer credit ca rds in the European Economic Area violate EC Treaty rules on restrictive business practices. The decision requires MasterCard to withdraw its multilateral interchange fees within six months. Mastercard has confirmed that it is appealing against the decision. A reduction in the rate of interchange as a result of these findings could affect the future yield on the card portfolio and adversely affect payment on your notes. 32 Back to Contents Super-Complaint to the OFT Concerning Credit Card Interest Charges In April 2007, the UK Consumer Interest Association known as Which? submitted a super-complaint to the OFT pursuant to the Enterprise Act 2002. The super-complaint criticises the various ways in which credit card companies calculate interest charges on credit card accounts. In June 2007, the OFT announced a new program of work with the credit card industry and consumer bodies in order to make the costs of credit cards easier for consumers to understand. The work explored the issues surrounding the costs of credit for credit cards including purchases, cash advances, introductory offers and payment allocation. In February 2008 the OFT published a report regarding the ability of consumers to compare credit cards in the market. In light of the report, the OFT have stated that it will work with the industry to implement improvements in summary boxes, on standardisation of terminology and in respect of consumer eduction. We are unable to determine and have no basis on which to predict accurately what effect this super-complaint might have on the cost of credit. No assurance can be given that the results of this programme of work will not adversely affect the ability of the issuing entity to make payments to the noteholders. OFT Market Study Result Uncertain The OFT announced a market study into personal current accounts ( PCAs ) in the U.K. on 26th April 2007. The market study will look at: (i) whether the provision of free if in credit PCAs delivers sufficiently high levels of transparency and value for customers; (ii) the implications for competition and consumers if there were to be a shift away from free if in credit PCAs; (iii) the fairness and impact on consumers generally of the incidence, level and consequences of account charges; and (iv) what steps could be taken to improve customers ability to secure better value for money, in particular to help customers make more informed current account choices and drive competition. The study will focus on PCAs but will include an examination of other retail banking products, in particular savings accounts, credit cards, personal loans and mortgages in order to take into account the competitive dynamics of UK retail banking. We are unable to determine and have no basis on which to predict accurately what effect this market study might have on the consumer credit agreements. No assurance can be given that the results of the market study will not adversely affect the ability of the issuing entity to make payments to the noteholders. Failure to Comply with the Electronic Commerce Directive Could Result in Disciplinary Action With effect from (for the most part) 21 August 2002, the ECommerce Directive (the  ECD ) has been effected in the United Kingdom by a number of statutory instruments and implementing rules including, but not limited to, the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 (which apply to non FSA regulated entities), the Electronic Commerce Directive (Financial Services and Markets) Regulations 2002, as amended (which apply to FSA regulated entities) and the creation of the Electronic Commerce Directive sourcebook ( ECO ) in the FSA Handbook. In essence the ECD aims to free up cross border information society services by requiring member states to apply the principle of country of origin regulation to services provided using electronic means. Information society services are defined as any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance by means of electronic equipment for the processing (including digital compression) and storage of data, and at the individual request of a recipient of a service and will therefore include (but are not limited to) web based online information. Under the principle of country of origin, a firm providing cross border information society services 33 Back to Contents must comply with the applicable rules in the country from which it is providing the services and the country into which it is providing the services cannot impose additional restrictions. As such, in providing information society services (whether in the United Kingdom or in another EEA state), the seller will be required to comply with applicable rules in the United Kingdom (including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom financial promotions regime). The ECD also requires member states to impose disclosure and other rules on firms offering information society services before any contract is entered into. The information to be disclosed includes, but is not limited to, contact details and background information in respect of the service provider, a variety of information which is required to be provided in a clear and unambiguous manner and disclosure of information to the recipient on how to conclude contractual arrangements. Failure to comply with the ECO rules could result in, amongst other things, disciplinary action by the FSA and possible claims under section 150 of FSMA for breach of FSA rules. Under the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 the information disclosure requirements are enforceable, at the suit of any recipient of a service, by an action against the service provider for damages for breach of statutory duty. In addition, where a person has entered into a contract to which the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 apply and the service provider has not made available means of allowing him to identify and correct input errors prior to concluding the contract, the recipient will be entitled to rescind the contract unless a court having jurisdiction in respect of the particular contract orders otherwise on the application of the service provider. The Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 also enable an application to be made for a court order to stop a n infringement of the information disclosure requirements which harms the collective interests of consumers. A Change in the Terms of the Designated Accounts May Adversely Affect the Amount or Timing of Collections and May Cause an Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Downgrade of Your Notes Only the receivables arising under the designated accounts are transferred to the receivables trustee. The originator will continue to own those accounts. As the owner of the accounts, the originator retains the right to change the terms of the accounts. For example, the originator could change the monthly interest rate, increase or reduce the credit limits on the accounts, reduce or eliminate fees on the accounts or reduce the required minimum monthly payment. The originator may change the terms of the accounts to maintain its competitive position in the U.K. credit and charge card industry. Changes in interest rates and fees could lower the amount of finance charge receivables generated by those accounts. This could cause a pay out event to occur with respect to any series of notes issued under this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, which might cause an early redemption of or a loss on your notes. This could also cause a reduction in the credit ratings on your notes. Principal on Your Notes May Be Paid Earlier Than Expected  Creating a Reinvestment Risk to You  or Later than Expected The receivables in the receivables trust may be paid at any time and we cannot assure you that new receivables will be generated or will be generated at levels needed to maintain the receivables trust. To prevent the early redemption of the notes, new receivables must be generated and added to the receivables trust or new accounts must be originated and nominated for the receivables trust. The receivables trust is required to maintain a minimum amount of receivables. The generation of new receivables or receivables in new accounts is affected by the originators ability to compete in the then current 34 Back to Contents industry environment and by customers changing borrowing and payment patterns. If there is a decline in the generation of new receivables or new accounts, you may be repaid your principal before the expected date. One factor that affects the level of finance charges and principal collections is the extent of convenience usage. Convenience usage means that the cardholders pay their account balances in full on or prior to the due date. The cardholder, therefore, avoids all finance charges on his or her account. An increase in the convenience usage by cardholders would decrease the effective yield on the accounts and could cause a pay out event with respect to any series of notes issued under this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms and therefore possibly an early redemption of your notes. No premium will be paid upon an early redemption of your notes. If you receive principal on your notes earlier than expected, you may not be able to reinvest the principal at a similar rate of return. Alternatively, a decrease in convenience usage may reduce the principal payment rate on the accounts. This could result in you receiving the principal on your notes later than expected. Credit Enhancement May Be Insufficient to Prevent a Loss on Your Notes Credit enhancement for your notes is limited and unless otherwise indicated in the corresponding prospectus supplement/final terms, the notes will not benefit from any external credit enhancement. The only assets that will be available to make payment on your notes are the assets of the issuing entity pledged to secure payment of your notes. If problems develop with the receivables, such as an increase in losses on the receivables, or if there are problems in the collection and transfer of the receivables to the receivables trust, or if the swap counterparty fails to make payments on the swap agreement, it is possible that you may not receive the full amount of interest and principal that you would otherwise receive. Issuance of Additional Series by the Receivables Trustee on Behalf of the Receivables Trust May Adversely Affect Payments on Your Notes Twelve series have been created within the receivables trust. Seven series have been redeemed. Additional series may from time to time be created within the receivables trust. Any new series of investor certificates  and medium term note certificates and notes  will also be payable from the receivables in the receivables trust. The principal terms of any new series of investor certificates will be contained in a new series supplement. The terms of a new series contained in the new supplement to the declaration of trust and trust cash management will not be subject to your prior review or consent. The principal terms of a new series may include methods for determining investor percentages and allocating collections, provisions creating different or additional security or other credit enhancement for the new series, provisions subordinating the new series to other series, and other amendments or supplements to the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement that apply only to the new series. It is a condition to the issuance of a new series that each rating agency that has rated any debt ultimately payable from a prior series of investor certificates that is outstanding  including your notes  confirms in writing that the issuance of the new series will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of its then current rating. However, the terms of a new series could adversely affect the timing and amounts of payments on any other outstanding series, including series of which your notes are a part. 35 Back to Contents Credit Quality of the Receivables Trusts Assets May Be Eroded by the Addition of New Accounts Which Could Adversely Affect Collections of Receivables The originator may designate additional credit or charge card accounts as designated accounts and offer the receivables trustee an assignment of the receivables arising under the additional accounts. The originator may be required at times to nominate additional accounts as designated accounts. These accounts may include accounts that were originated or acquired using criteria that are different from those applicable to the accounts from which receivables were originally assigned to the receivables trustee before the issuance of the series of notes issued pursuant to this base prospectus and the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. For example, they could be originated at a different date with different underwriting standards, or they could be acquired from another institution that used different underwriting standards. Consequently, there can be no assurance that accounts that become designated accounts in the future will have the same credit quality as the designated accounts on the closing date. This could adversely affect collections on the receivables. If this occurred you could suffer an early redemption of or a loss on your notes. Interest Rate Payable on Each Medium Term Note Certificate May Increase Without a Corresponding Change in Card Interest Rates Potentially Causing a Loss on Your Notes or Early Redemption of Your Notes In line with the rest of the U.K. market, Barclaycard may apply differential interest rates to each product offering, some of which may be fixed for predetermined periods. The majority of the designated accounts have monthly interest rates that are constant, except for Barclaycards ability to change the interest rate at its discretion. This affects the amount of finance charge collections the receivables trustee can pay to the MTN issuing entity to fund interest payments on the medium term note certificates then outstanding. The interest rate paid on the medium term note certificate will be based on the London interbank offered rate for deposits in sterling, which changes from time to time. Accordingly, the interest payable on the medium term note certificate could increase without a corresponding increase in the amount of finance charge collections. If this occurred, you could suffer a loss on your notes or a pay out event could occur causing an early redemption of your notes. Commingling of Collections with Originator May Delay or Reduce Payments on Your Notes Collections from cardholders for the designated accounts and other Barclaycard cardholders of non-securitised accounts will initially be paid to an operating account of the originator. The originator has declared a trust over the operating account in favour of the receivables trustee for collections that are deposited in it. Collections on the designated accounts will be transferred to the trustee collection account within three business days of being identified. For the limited time that collections on the designated accounts are in the operating account, they may be commingled with other funds of the originator or future beneficiaries and they may be untraceable. Consequently, if the originator were to become insolvent, there may be a delay in the transfer of collections to the receivables trustee if the originator  or a liquidator or administrator of the originator  attempted to freeze the operation of the operating account pending completion of any rights of tracing. This could ultimately cause a delay or reduction in the payments you receive on your notes. If the Originator Opts to Treat a Portion of Principal Receivables as Finance Charge Receivables, an Early Redemption of Your Notes Could Occur or Could Be Delayed The originator may opt to cause a percentage of receivables that would otherwise be treated as principal receivables to be treated as finance charge receivables. This is called a discount option (the  discount option ). If the originator were to exercise this discount option, it could prevent a pay out event from occurring because of a reduction of the portfolio yield, which could delay an early redemption of your notes at a time when the performance of the receivables is deteriorating. Once this discount option is exercised, the originator may also reduce the percentage or stop using the 36 Back to Contents percentage at any time. However, this discount option, if exercised, will reduce the aggregate amount of principal receivables, which may increase the likelihood that the originator will be required to designate additional accounts from which receivables will be assigned to the receivables trustee. If the originator were unable to designate additional accounts, a pay out event could occur and you could receive payments of principal on your notes before you expect them. If Optional Early Redemption Occurs, It Will Result in an Early Redemption of Your Notes Creating a Reinvestment Risk When the total principal balance of the notes is reduced to less than 10 per cent. of their original principal balance, the issuing entity has the option to redeem the notes in full. This early redemption ( optional early redemption ) may result in an early return of your investment. No premium will be paid in the event of an exercise of the early redemption option. If you receive principal on your notes earlier than expected, you may not be able to reinvest the principal at a rate of return similar to that on your notes. If Cardholders are Concentrated in a Geographic Region, Economic Downturn in that Region may Adversely Affect Collections of Receivables If the receivables trust has a high concentration of receivables from cardholders located in a single region, an economic downturn in that region may have a magnified adverse effect on the receivables trust because of that concentration. The relevant prospectus supplement/final terms will contain a geographic breakdown of accounts and the amount of receivables generated in the regions of the United Kingdom. See  Receivables Information: Geographic Distribution of Accounts  Securitised Portfolio . Future adverse economic conditions affecting any of these regions or any of the other regions, however, could adversely affect the performance of the receivables which could result in a loss on your notes. Adoption of the Euro by the United Kingdom Would Have Uncertain Effects on Your Notes Before your notes have matured, the euro could become the lawful currency of the United Kingdom. If that were to happen, (i) all amounts payable on the medium term note certificate may become payable in euro and (ii) applicable provisions of law may allow the issuing entity to redenominate each class of notes denominated in sterling into euro and take additional measures in respect of each class. If the medium term note certificate is outstanding on the date, if any, on which the euro becomes the lawful currency of the United Kingdom, we intend to make payments on the medium term note certificate and the swap agreements according to the then market practice of payment on debts or, as the case may be, swaps. We are uncertain what effect, if any, the adoption of the euro by the United Kingdom may have on your notes. Taxable Nature of the MTN Issuing Entity or the Issuing Entity Could Cause a Loss on Your Notes The MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity will be liable to UK corporation tax. So long as the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity respectively are within the application of the Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations 2006 (the  regulations ), their taxable profit for U.K. corporation tax purposes will in each case be equal to certain cash amounts retained by them respectively in accordance with the application of available funds. In order to fall within the application of the regulations, a company must fulfil certain conditions, including ones which relate to its ongoing asset holdings (e.g. that the assets should be financial assets according to applicable accounting practice at the time of acquisition) and its ongoing cash flow management. These conditions are designed to ensure that the regulations will apply to a company which is genuinely established and operated as a securitisation vehicle in a securitisation of money debts. Provided 37 Back to Contents that the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity are as a matter of fact managed at all times so as to meet the conditions laid down by the regulations, the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity can be expected to fall within the application of the regulations. The regulations are in short form and have only been in force since the beginning of 2007 and the practice of the UK tax authorities in implementing the regulations is still evolving. However, the UK tax authorities have worked very closely with the securitisation industry on developing the regulations and related practices, and the regulations are designed to allow genuine securitisation vehicle companies to be taxed on a basis which is compatible with market and rating requirements. It is expected that advisors will rely significantly upon guidance from the UK tax authorities when advising on the scope and operation of the regulations including advising as to whether any particular company falls within the new regime. If the MTN issuing entity or the issuing entity failed to satisfy any of the applicable conditions, and so did not fall within the application of the regulations, the taxable profits of the company in question would be computed on the basis of generally accepted accounting practice (as referred to in the U.K. tax legislation) (subject to certain adjustments and disallowances under the U.K. tax legislation). This could potentially lead to the affected company having taxable profits which were different from its net cash position, giving rise to unfunded tax liabilities for that company, and you could suffer losses on your notes as a result. If at any time either the MTN issuing entity or the issuing entity ceases to meet any of the applicable conditions, that entity will cease to be within the application of the regulations, with the consequences described above. It should be noted that the failure of either entity to meet any of the applicable conditions in respect of one series of notes will result in that entity ceasing to be within the application of the regulations in respect of all of its U.K. tax liabilities. This means that all series of notes outstanding at that time will be affected. The above description is based on the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity being resident for tax purposes in the U.K. Each of them respectively will be so resident if and for so long as it is, as a matter of fact, centrally managed and controlled in the U.K. Change in the Taxable Nature or Basis of Taxation of the Receivables Trustee, MTN Issuing Entity or Issuing Entity Could Cause a Loss on Your Notes If there is a relevant change of law in the United Kingdom or Jersey, or change of practice of HMRC, this could result in the taxable profits of the MTN issuing entity or the issuing entity being greater than expected and you could suffer losses on your notes as a result. An opinion of U.K. tax advisers is not binding on HMRC or the courts, and no specific transaction rulings on this issue will be obtained from HMRC. In addition, there is no case law authority on a number of features of the transactions that raise difficult questions. Limited Nature of Credit Ratings Assigned to Your Notes Each credit rating assigned to your notes reflects the rating agencys assessment only of the likelihood that interest and principal will be paid to you by the final redemption date, not that it will be paid when expected or scheduled. These ratings are based on the rating agencies determination of the value of the receivables, the reliability of the payments on the receivables, the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty and the availability of credit enhancement. 38 Back to Contents Any rating agency may lower or withdraw its rating with respect to the relevant swap counterparty. The issuing entity expects under the terms of any swap agreement that may be entered into in respect of a class of notes that in the event that the swap counterparty's rating is lowered below the rating required in the relevant swap agreement the swap counterparty will be obliged to use reasonable efforts to transfer or novate the swap agreement to a replacement swap counterparty or post collateral to the issuing entity or enter into other suitable arrangements. However, there can be no assurance that the swap counterparty will be able to find a replacement counterparty to enable it to transfer or novate the swap agreement or that the swap counterparty will be able to post collateral to the issuing entity and/or enter into other suitable arrangements in this event or that the ratings of the notes will not be lowered or withdrawn in this event. If any rating assigned to the notes is lowered or withdrawn, then the market value of the notes may be reduced. The ratings do not address the following: (i) the likelihood that the principal or interest on your notes will be redeemed or paid, as expected, on the scheduled redemption dates; (ii) the possibility of the imposition of United Kingdom or any other withholding tax; (iii) the marketability of the notes, or any market price; or (iv) that an investment in the notes is a suitable investment for you. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold or sell notes. Ratings Can Be Lowered or Withdrawn After You Purchase Your Notes Any rating agency may lower its rating or withdraw its rating if, in the sole judgement of the rating agency, the credit quality of the notes has declined or is in question or for other tangible and intangible reasons. If any rating assigned to your notes is lowered or withdrawn, the market value of your notes may be reduced. Change in Law May Result in Withholding Taxes on the Medium Term Note Certificates and this May Reduce the Amount You Are Paid on Your Notes If any withholding taxes would be imposed  by any jurisdiction  on payments to the issuing entity under a medium term note certificate as a result of a change in applicable law, then the MTN issuing entity additional interest payments, to the extent available, will be converted into the relevant currency at the spot exchange rate to cover the shortfall in the amounts available for payment to the noteholders caused by the amount withheld. If the MTN issuing entity additional interest payments are not sufficient to cover the shortfall, then payments to first the class D noteholders, second the class C noteholders, third the class B noteholders and finally the class A noteholders will be reduced by the amount withheld that is not covered by the MTN issuing entity additional interest payments. Such deficiency in payment shall be deferred to the next and succeeding distribution date. If any withholding tax would be imposed on any payments made or required to be made by the swap counterparty to the issuing entity or by the issuing entity to the swap counterparty under a swap agreement, the amounts paid by the swap counterparty or the issuing entity may, if so indicated in the section entitled  Swap Agreements  in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, be reduced. In these circumstances, the MTN issuing entity additional interest 39 Back to Contents payments, to the extent available, will be converted into the relevant currency at the spot exchange rate to cover the shortfall in the amounts available for payment to the noteholders caused by the amount withheld. If the MTN issuing entity additional interest payments are not sufficient to cover the shortfall, then payments to noteholders will be reduced by the amount withheld that is not covered by the MTN issuing entity additional interest payments, with holders of subordinated notes first suffering such a reduction. Change in Law May Result in Withholding Taxes on Your Notes and this May Reduce the Amount You Are Paid on Your Notes If any U.K. withholding taxes are imposed on any payments made or required to be made by the issuing entity or any paying agent on any class of notes, then payments to that class of noteholders will be reduced pro rata by any amount withheld for any withholding taxes, and in addition, if the relevant noteholders so elect to direct the issuing entity, the issuing entity will terminate the swap. See  The Swap Agreements.  Payment of an Early Termination Payment to the Swap Counterparty May Reduce Payments on Your Notes If a swap agreement is terminated before its scheduled termination date, the issuing entity or the swap counterparty may be liable to make an early termination payment to the other party. The amount of any early termination payment will be based on the market value of the terminated swap agreement. This market value will be computed on the basis of market quotations of the cost of entering into a swap transaction with the same terms and conditions that would have the effect of preserving the respective full payment obligations of the parties. Any early termination payment could, if the relevant exchange rate has changed significantly, be substantial. Any early termination payment made by the issuing entity to the swap counterparty under a swap agreement will be made from MTN issuing entity interest payments and from repayments of principal on the medium term note certificate equal to the amount of principal repayments received by the issuing entity on the medium term note certificate. That could cause the sterling amounts available for conversion to the relevant currency, and possibly your payments, to be reduced  perhaps substantially. If the amount of available MTN issuing entity additional interest payments and repayments of principal on the medium term note certificate is insufficient to pay the early termination payment under the relevant swap agreement, the balance of the early termination payment will be paid to the extent that such amounts are available on the next interest payment date together with interest. You Will Not Receive Physical Notes, Which May Cause Delays in Distributions and Hamper Your Ability to Pledge or Resell the Notes Unless the global note certificates are exchanged for individual note certificates, which will only occur under a limited set of circumstances, your beneficial ownership of the notes will only be registered in book entry form with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. The lack of physical notes could, among other things: (i) result in payment delays on the notes because we will be sending distributions on the notes to DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg instead of directly to you; (ii) make it difficult for you to pledge or otherwise grant security over the notes if physical notes are required by the party demanding the pledge or other security; and (iii) hinder your ability to resell the notes because some investors may be unwilling to buy notes that are not in physical form. Termination of the Servicer May Cause Disruptions in the Collection Process that Could Affect the Timeliness of Your Payments on Your Notes If the appointment of Barclaycard as servicer is terminated under the terms of the beneficiaries servicing agreement, it will be necessary for the receivables trustee to appoint a successor servicer to undertake the obligations and to perform the services of card services. See  Servicing of Receivables and Trust Cash Management  for a description of the circumstances in which such termination may occur and the consequences of such termination. The transfer to a new 40 Back to Contents servicer may create disruptions in the collection process that could cause delays in the payments received by the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity and, ultimately, in payments due on your notes. Change of Law  Insolvency Act 2000 The Insolvency Act 2000 amends part I of the Insolvency Act 1986 so that the directors of a company which meets certain eligibility criteria (an  eligible company ) can take steps to obtain a moratorium the effect of which, inter alia , would prevent any creditor enforcing security or taking proceedings to recover its debt for the period in which the moratorium is in force (the  relevant provisions ). The relevant provisions came into force on 1 January 2003. However, prior to bringing the provisions into force, the Secretary of State amended the eligibility criteria by way of statutory instrument to the effect that special purpose vehicles such as the issuing entity are not eligible companies. A Finding that the Issuing Entity or the Receivables Trustee Should Have Registered Under the Investment Company Act Could Materially Adversely Affect Such Entity Neither the issuing entity nor the receivables trustee has registered with the SEC as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act. If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the issuing entity or the receivables trustee is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act, had failed to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the issuing entity or the receivables trustee could sue the issuing entity or the receivables trustee and recover any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the issuing entity or the receivables trustee is party that is made in, or whose performance involves, a violation of the Investment Company Act would be unenforceable by any party to the contract unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equit able result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the issuing entity or the receivables trustee be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, such entity would be materially and adversely affected. The Enterprise Act 2002  Appointment of an Administrative Receiver Remains Possible The provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the  Enterprise Act ) amending certain corporate insolvency provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986, came into force on 15 September 2003. As a result of the amendments made by the Enterprise Act, unless a floating charge was created prior to 15 September 2003, or falls within one of the exceptions contained in the Enterprise Act, the holder of a qualifying floating charge will be prohibited from appointing an administrative receiver to a company and, consequently, the ability to prevent the appointment of an administrator to such company will be lost. Although the floating charge to be granted by the issuing entity pursuant to the terms of the note trust deed is a qualifying floating charge for the purposes of the Enterprise Act, it will fall within the  capital market arrangement  exception to the prohibition on appointment of an administrative receiver and accordingly the note trustee will still be able to appoint an administrative receiver pursuant to the note trust deed and any series note trust deed supplement. Change of Law  EU directive on the Taxation of Savings Income Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the  EU savings tax directive ), each member state is required to provide to the tax authorities of another member state details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in that 41 Back to Contents other member state; however, for a transitional period, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg may instead apply a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at rates rising over time to 35 per cent. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments. A number of non-EU countries, and certain dependent or associated territories of certain Member States, have agreed to adopt similar measures (in certain circumstances on a reciprocal basis) to those implemented by the EU savings tax directive (see further the section entitled  United Kingdom Taxation Treatment of the Notes  under the heading European Union Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income). Jersey is not subject to the EU savings tax directive. However, in keeping with Jerseys policy of constructive international engagement, the State of Jersey has introduced a retention tax system in respect of payments of interest, or other similar income, made to an individual beneficial owner resident in an EU member state by a paying agent situate in Jersey (the terms  beneficial owner  and  paying agent  are defined in the EU savings tax directive). The retention tax system will apply for a transitional period prior to the implementation of a system of automatic communication to EU member states of information regarding such payments. The transitional period will end only after all EU member states apply automatic exchange of information and the EU member states unanimously agree that the United States of America has committed to exchange of information upon request. During this transitional period, such an individual beneficial owner resident i n an EU member state will be entitled to request a paying agent not to retain tax from such payments but instead to apply a system by which the details of such payments are communicated to the tax authorities of the EU member state in which the beneficial owner is resident. Unless and Until Individual Note Certificates are Issued, Persons Acquiring Notes will not be the Legal Owners or Holders of Such Notes, But Will Hold Only Book-Entry Interests Unless and until individual note certificates are issued, persons acquiring notes will not be the legal owners or holders of such notes but will have rights in their capacity as participants in accordance with the rules and procedures of the relevant clearing system and in the case of indirect participants, their agreements with direct participants (such rights,  book-entry interests ). After payment to the common depositary and the DTC custodian, the issuing entity will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear, Clearstream, the DTC custodian, the common depositary or to holders of book-entry interests. Either the common depositary or Cede & Co. as nominee of DTC will be the registered holder and legal owner of each class of notes for so long as such class is represented by one or more global note certificates. Accordingly, each person owning a book-entry interest must rely on the relevant procedures of the common depositary, the DTC custodian, Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC and, if such person is an indirect participant in such entities, on the procedures of the direct participant through which such person holds its interest, to exercise any rights of noteholders under the note trust deed. So long as the notes are in global form, payments of principal and interest on, and other amounts due in respect of, notes will be made to the common depositary and to Cede & Co. as nominee of DTC. Upon receipt of any payment, Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC will promptly credit direct participants accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective ownership of book-entry interests, as shown on their records. The issuing entity expects that payments by direct participants or indirect participants to owners of 42 Back to Contents interests in book-entry interests held through such participants or indirect participants will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with the securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in street name, and will be the responsibility of such direct participants or indirect participants. None of the issuing entity, the note trustee, the DTC custodian, any paying agent or the registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, the book-entry interests or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such book-entry interests. Unlike holders of individual note certificates, holders of the book-entry interests will not have direct rights under the note trust deed to act upon solicitations of consents or requests by the issuing entity for waivers or other actions from noteholders. Instead, a holder of book-entry interests will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC (as the case may be) and, if applicable, direct participants. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable holders of book-entry interests to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default, holders of book-entry interests will be restricted to acting through the Euroclear, Clearstream, DTC or the DTC custodian (as the case may be) unless and until individual note certificates are issued. There can be no assurance that the procedures to be implement ed by the Euroclear, Clearstream, DTC and the DTC custodian under such circumstances will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of remedies under the note trust deed. See  The Notes  Clearance and Settlement . Holders of beneficial interests in notes which are denominated in sterling or euros and which are held directly with DTC or through its participants must give advance notice to the exchange agent 15 days prior to each interest payment date that they wish payments on such global note certificates to be made to them in sterling or euro (as applicable) outside DTC. If such instructions are not given, sterling or euro payments on such notes will be exchanged for U.S. dollars by the exchange agent prior to their receipt by DTC and the affected holders will receive U.S. dollars on the relevant interest payment date. 43 Back to Contents U.S. DOLLAR AND STERLING EXCHANGE RATE References throughout this document to  £ ,  pounds ,  sterling  or  pounds sterling  are to the lawful currency of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Its registered office is at 26 New Street, St. Helier, Jersey and its principal place of business in the United Kingdom is located at 11 Old Jewry, London EC2R 8DU, United Kingdom (tel: +44 (0)207 796 9348). The issuing entity has no subsidiaries. The issuing entity was incorporated with an authorised and issued share capital of two ordinary shares of £1 each which were allotted for cash, and fully paid, on incorporation and are held by bare nominees for a charitable trustee under the terms of a share declaration of trust. It has a fiscal year end date of 31 December. There is no loan capital, borrowing, other indebtedness, contingent liabilities or guarantees as at the date of this base prospectus in respect of this company. There has been no material change in the capitalisation, indebtedness, guarantees and contingent liabilities and the issuing entity has not traded since 7 September 2007. The issuing entity was formed principally to: (i) issue the notes from time to time; (ii) enter into and perform its duties under all financial arrangements in order to issue the notes in connection with the Barclaycard securitisation programme; (iii) purchase each relevant medium term note certificate; and (iv) enter into and perform its duties under all the documents necessary to purchase each relevant medium term note certificate and issue each series of notes as specified in the prospectus supplement/final terms. The assets of the issuing entity consist of: (i) each relevant MTN certificate; and (ii) if applicable, swap agreements that the issuing entity enters into from time to time to manage currency risk. The issuing entity does not expect to have any other significant assets. Directors and Secretary The following sets out the directors of the issuing entity and their business addresses and principal activities. Because the issuing entity is organised as a special purpose company and will be largely passive, it is expected that the directors of the issuing entity in that capacity will participate in its management to a limited extent. Name Nationality Business Address Principal Activities Age Curt John Hess American 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP Chief Financial Officer, Barclaycard 43 Geoffrey Simms British 11 Old Jewry, London EC2R 8DU Director 50 John Ventress British 11 Old Jewry, London EC2R 8DU Lawyer 36 Geoffrey Simms and John Ventress are directors of Bedell Trust UK Limited which along with Bedell Trust Company Limited, Bedell Secretaries Limited and Bedell Trustees Limited (the  Bedell Group Companies ) is ultimately owned by the partners for the time being of the Bedell Group partnership. John Ventress is a partner of the Bedell Group. Fees are payable to Bedell Trust Company Limited pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the administration agreement referred to below. 45 Back to Contents The issuing entity is aware that the payment of such fees, the appointments of such directors and John Ventress beneficial interest in the Bedell Group and thereby the Bedell Group Companies may result in potential conflicts of interests between the duties owed to it and the private interests of its board of directors. Curt John Hess is also a director of the MTN issuing entity, the receivables trustee and is the Chief Financial Officer of Barclaycard. The issuing entity is aware that the appointment of Curt John Hess may result in potential conflicts of interests between the duties owed to it and the private interests of its board of directors. Bedell Trust Company Limited will provide the issuing entity with general secretarial and administration services. The fees of Bedell Trust Company Limited for providing such services will be included in the MTN Issuing Entity Costs Amounts. See  Securitisation Cashflows: Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Finance Charge Collections to the MTN Issuing Entity . The secretary of the issuing entity is: Name Business Address Bedell Secretaries Limited 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey For each series, the net proceeds of the sale of the notes converted into sterling under the relevant swap agreement will be used by the issuing entity to purchase a medium term note certificate. The issuing entity will be prohibited by the note trust deed and the terms and conditions of the notes from engaging in business other than: (i) the business described in this base prospectus; (ii) preserving and exercising its rights under the notes, the paying agency and agent bank agreement, the note trust deed, the Swap Agreements, the corporate services agreement, the programme dealer agreement and the relevant series subscription agreement for the notes; and (iii) purchasing medium term note certificates. The issuing entitys ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt will also be restricted by the note trust deed and the terms and conditions of the notes. Barclays does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the issuing entity. Bankruptcy Matters Relating to the Issuing Entity The issuing entity has been organized, and its activities are limited, to minimize the likelihood of bankruptcy proceedings being commenced against the issuing entity and to minimize the likelihood that there would be claims against the issuing entity if bankruptcy proceedings were commenced against it. The issuing entity has not engaged in and will not engage in any activity other than the business and activities described or referred to in this base prospectus. Capitalisation and Indebtedness As at the date of this base prospectus, the issuing entity has no loan capital outstanding or created but unissued, no term loans outstanding and no other borrowings or indebtedness in the nature of borrowings guaranteed or unguaranteed, secured or unsecured nor any contingent liabilities. Two ordinary shares were allotted for cash, and fully paid, on incorporation. There are no other outstanding securities, loans or subscriptions, allotments or options in respect of the issuing entity. There is no goodwill in the balance sheet of the issuing entity, nor will any goodwill need to be written off upon the issue of the notes. 46 Back to Contents Financial Position The issuing entity has not commenced operations since its incorporation on 7 September 2007. As of the date of this base prospectus, no financial statements in respect of the issuing entity have been made up. There has been no material adverse change in the financial position or prospects of the issuing entity since its date of incorporation. There has been no significant change in the financial or trading position of the issuing entity since its date of incorporation. The Administrator Bedell Trust Company Limited, which we will refer to as the Administrator in this base prospectus, will provide company administration services to the issuing entity and the receivables trustee under the relevant corporate services agreements. Bedell Secretaries Limited will provide company secretarial services to the issuing entity and the receivables trustee. Bedell Trust Company Limited is a private limited company which was incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands on 3 April 1992 with registered number 52417. Its registered office is located at 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey JE2 3RA, Channel Islands. The Administrator is ultimately owned by the partners from time to time of the Bedell Group Partnership. The Administrator undertakes diversified offshore trust administration services and is regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission under the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998, for the purpose of carrying on trust company business. Use of Proceeds The proceeds of the issue of each series of notes (after taking into account the conversion into sterling of any other currency received with respect to the issue of the notes) will be used to purchase from the MTN issuing entity the corresponding medium term note certificate of such value and on such terms as further specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. The MTN issuing entity will use the proceeds from the sale of such medium term note certificate to purchase the investor certificate of the same series. Alternatively, the MTN issuing entity may repay principal on a medium term note certificate. Fees and commissions arising from the issue of each series of notes will be covered by the issuing entity. The issuing entity will in turn be indemnified for such amount by the originator pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement, defined below. Indemnity Agreement On or prior to the closing date of the first series of notes to be issued by the issuing entity, the issuing entity will enter into an indemnification agreement (the  Indemnity Agreement ) made with Barclays as the provider of the indemnity. On the date of issuance of each series of notes, the issuing entity  as the indemnified party  may request indemnification in relation to each series, under which Barclays will pay to the issuing entity an amount corresponding to the amount (and any such amount will be set out in the prospectus supplement/final terms corresponding to such series) expected to be expended by the issuing entity to meet its costs and expenses relating to issuing such series of notes. Barclays Bank PLC and the Receivables Trustee have agreed, pursuant to an agreement supplementing the Receivables Securitisation Agreement dated [] 2008, to make the unconditional entry by Barclays into such an Indemnity Agreement a condition precedent to the receivables trustee being under any obligation to purchase the receivables, or to pay any purchase price, under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement. Series Expenses Loan Drawings The issuing entity may, if specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, enter into a revolving facility under a loan agreement (the  Expenses Loan Agreement ) made with Barclays as lender, this facility being an  Expenses Loan Facility . Under such a facility, the issuing entity  as borrower  may request a drawing of an advance under the Expenses Loan Facility under which Barclays, if it agrees to make such advance, would lend to the issuing entity in respect of such series such amount (and any such amount will be set out in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms). Each such drawing under an Expenses Loan Facility is called a  Series Expenses Loan Drawing . The amount 47 Back to Contents outstanding under a Series Expenses Loan Drawing would bear interest at the rate of one-month sterling LIBOR plus a margin that will be specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. The payment of interest under each Expenses Loan Agreement would be paid monthly on each Distribution Date. The payment of interest and repayment of any principal then specified as being due and repayable under the Expenses Loan Agreement would be monthly on each Distribution Date. To the extent the issuing entity had insufficient funds left after making all payments of principal and interest on the notes, the amount of that interest or any repayment of principal then due would be deferred until the next Distribution Date. Further details regarding the Expenses Loan Agreement, if any, relating to a series or class of notes will be set out in the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms. 48 Back to Contents THE DEPOSITOR AND MTN ISSUING ENTITY The Depositor of the programme and the MTN issuing entity was formed in England and Wales on 13 August 1990 as Barshelfco (No. 28) Limited, with registered number 2530163, as a company with limited liability under the Companies Acts 1985 and 1989, which is the primary legislation under which the MTN issuing entity operates. It reregistered as a public limited company and changed its name to Barclaycard Funding PLC on 19 October 1999. Its registered office and principal place of business are located at 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP, United Kingdom (tel: 0207 1161000). The MTN issuing entity has a fiscal year end of 31 December. The statutory financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). For IFRS purposes, the MTN issuing entity is deemed to control Gracechurch Card Programme Funding Limited which would be included in any consolidated financial statements prepared by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity is exempt from having to prepare consolidated financial statements because it is an intermediate parent undertaking whose owners do not object to it not preparing consolidated financial statements, its debt and equity instruments are not traded in a public market and its ultimate parent undertaking, Barclays Bank PLC, produces consolidated financial statements available for public use that apply IFRS. The MTN issuing entity was formed principally to: (i) issue medium term note certificates from time to time in series; (ii) enter into and perform its duties under the financial arrangements to issue the medium term note certificates in connection with the Gracechurch securitisation programme; (iii) purchase each relevant series of investor certificates from time to time representing a beneficial interest in the receivables trust; and (iv) enter into the program documents and exercise its powers connected to the above. The MTN issuing entity has not engaged in any activities since its incorporation other than the above. The £12,502 called up share capital of the MTN issuing entity comprises 49,998 ordinary £1 shares that have been authorised, issued, quarter called and paid and 2 ordinary £1 shares that have been authorised, issued and fully paid up. Barclays holds 75 per cent. of the issued share capital of the MTN issuing entity, representing 51 per cent. of the issued voting share capital and a 49 per cent. entitlement to distributable profits.

The total population of the United Kingdom is approximately 61 million with the adult population accounting for about 82 per cent. of this. It is estimated that approximately two thirds of the adult British population holds at least one credit card. The number of cards issued has grown by 38 million since 1995 to about 65 million today. Of these, about 47 per cent. carried the VISA service mark and 53 per cent. the MasterCard service mark. Credit and charge card purchases in the United Kingdom, in the twelve months to December 2007, totalled almost £13 billion. U.K. credit card borrowings have more than doubled since 1994, and the amount of credit card borrowings outstanding was approximately £65 billion in December 2007. 59 Back to Contents BARCLAYCARD AND THE BARCLAYCARD CARD PORTFOLIO General Barclaycard, a division of Barclays Bank PLC, is one of the leading credit card businesses in Europe. In addition to its operations in the United Kingdom, Barclaycard is active in Germany, Spain, the United States, Greece, France, Italy, Portugal, Scandinavia, India, the UAE and across Africa. Barclaycard offers a full range of credit card services to individual and corporate customers, together with card payment facilities to retailers and other businesses. Barclaycard is based in Northampton, England and has in excess of 8,300 employees worldwide. In 1966, Barclaycard issued the U.K.s first credit card and as of 31 December 2007 Barclaycard, on a managed basis, had £20,892 million of gross customer receivables across the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe and the US. Of this amount, £8,733 million were MasterCard and VISA credit and charge card receivables originated in the United Kingdom and included in the receivables trust. Barclaycard offers an extensive range of Barclaycard and co-branded credit card products and services to individual and corporate customers. The average U.K. customer has had a Barclaycard for approximately 10 years. The receivables being securitised come from transactions made by MasterCard and VISA card accountholders. A cardholder may use his or her card for both purchases and cash advances. A purchase is when cardholders use their cards to acquire goods or services. A cash advance is when cardholders use their cards to get cash from a financial institution or automated teller machine or use credit card cheques issued by Barclaycard drawn against their credit lines. See  Servicing of Receivables and Trust Cash Management  for a description of how Barclaycard services receivables included in the securitisation. Barclaycard undertakes all the processing and administering of accounts making use of external suppliers as appropriate. Barclaycard uses a brand led, value driven marketing strategy to focus new origination campaigns. This process is assisted by the use of financial forecasting models for each method it uses to solicit cardholders. Barclaycard recruits a significant proportion of its customers by introductions from Barclays branches. It also uses, among others, targeted mailing, media inserts and the internet. Credit application details are screened by a combination of system based checking, external credit bureau data and manual verification, where appropriate. Barclaycard uses a range of application scorecards to assess the credit quality of new account applications. Scorecards are derived using a combination of factors including their Barclays account history, annual income, time at and place of residence, current employment and credit bureau data. A proprietary cash flow model is used to help determine the acceptance score levels for each scorecard. The initial limit of an account is determined using credit score and other applicant characteristics including income matrices. Initial limits are set at comparatively low levels. Limits are increased in a controlled and regular manner using behaviour score and credit bureau data. Behaviour scoring was introduced in 1989 and is one of the key tools used by Barclaycard in risk management and underpins all risk decisions applied to accounts once they have been opened. Credit limits are adjusted based upon Barclaycards continuing evaluation of an account holders credit behaviour and suitability using a range of statistical models. As part of the asset origination procedure, the processing and validation of each credit card application is performed by RR Donnelley Global Document Solutions Ltd ( RRD ) based in Huntingdon, England, a wholly owned subsidiary of RR Donnelley and Sons Company, unaffiliated with the Barclays Group. Reference data for the credit scoring process is also provided by Experian Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Experian Group Ltd located in operational headquarters in Nottingham, England, and Equifax Plc a company unaffiliated with the Barclays Group based in London, England. Barclays believes that should RRD, Experian or Equifax cease to provide any of the above services to its card business, it will be able to contract for comparable services from other qualified entities. 60 Back to Contents Each cardholder has a card agreement with Barclaycard governing the terms and conditions of their MasterCard or VISA account. Under each card agreement, Barclaycard is able, if it gives advance notice to the cardholder, to add or change any terms, conditions, services or features of the MasterCard or VISA accounts at any time. This includes increasing or decreasing periodic finance charges, or minimum payment terms. Each card agreement enables Barclaycard to apply charges to current outstanding balances as well as to future transactions. Barclaycard regularly reviews its credit and charge card agreement forms to determine their compliance with applicable law and the suitability of their terms and conditions. If they need to be updated or amended, this will be done on a timetable consistent with the issues identified. Description of Processing Barclaycard settlement systems have links to VISA and MasterCard to enable cardholder transactions to be transferred. Barclaycard also acquires transactions from merchants. Transactions acquired in this way relating to Barclaycard cardholders are passed to the card account processing systems directly rather than via VISA or MasterCard. Billing and Payment Barclaycard generates and mails monthly statements to cardholders which give details of the transactions for that account, making use of one external outsource partner in particular. RRD carry out the printing of statements and also perform cardholder postal payment processing. Data files for monthly statement production are produced by the Triumph cards system, and transmitted to RRD who carry out the printing of statements. Printed statements are then returned to Barclaycard for insertion in envelopes along with marketing and customer service material that may be of interest to cardholders. Cardholders receive up to 56 days interest free on purchases before they are required to make a payment. At the moment, cardholders must make a monthly minimum payment which is at least equal to the greater of: (i) 2 per cent. on platinum and gold, 2.5 per cent.  on classic, 3 per cent.  on initial, student, graduate and choice  of the statement balance; and (ii) the stated minimum payment, which is currently £5. Notwithstanding the above, in the case of the Premier Card, Barclaycards charge card product, cardholders must pay the statement balance in full, which is collected via direct debit 14 days after the date of the statement. Certain eligible cardholders may be given the option to take a payment holiday. Barclaycard charges late and overlimit fees as well as charges for returned cheques and returned direct debits. Charges may also be made, to a lesser extent, for copy statements and copy vouchers. Whilst Barclaycard does not charge an annual fee on all products, annual fees can be up to £150 on those products on which an annual fee is charged. Barclaycard also assesses a cash advance fee which ranges from 1.5 per cent. to 2.5 per cent., with minimum charges of £5. The finance charges on purchases assessed monthly are calculated by multiplying the accounts average daily purchase balance over the billing period by the applicable monthly rate. Finance charges are calculated on purchases from the date of the transaction. Monthly periodic finance charges are not assessed on purchases if all balances shown in the billing statement are paid by the date they are due. This is usually 25 days after the billing date. The finance charges on cash advances assessed monthly are calculated by multiplying the accounts average daily balance of cash advances over the billing period by the applicable monthly rate. Finance charges are calculated on cash advances from the date of the transaction  except for cash advances by use of credit card cheques, where finance charges are usually calculated from the date the transaction is debited to the relevant account. 61 Back to Contents The interest rates on Barclaycards credit card accounts may be changed by Barclaycard and are not currently linked to any index. This is market practice in the United Kingdom. At the moment, the standard annual percentage rate of charge for purchases on accounts ranges from [] to [] per cent. (excluding introductory offers). Barclaycard may sometimes offer temporary promotional rates. Barclaycard also offers activation programs and other incentives. Pricing decisions are based upon: (i) actual and anticipated movements in underlying interest rates; (ii) marketing strategies and recruitment campaigns; and (iii) competitive environment. English law does not prescribe a maximum rate that may be charged as interest for a debt. However, the obligation to make interest payments will not be enforceable to the extent that the interest rate is extortionate. An interest rate will be extortionate if it requires the debtor or a relative of the debtor to make payments  whether unconditionally or on certain contingencies  which are grossly exorbitant, or which otherwise grossly contravene ordinary principles of fair dealing. Barclaycard believes that the interest rates charged on its cards do not contravene any laws relating to extortionate credit agreements. Delinquency and Loss Experience An account is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the due date indicated on the customers statement. An account does not actually become delinquent until a new customer statement is sent following a missed payment on the account. Once an account is recognised as delinquent, the account is electronically flagged as delinquent. The basis upon which the account is transferred to a collections team within Barclaycard may include the product type, the age of the account, the amount outstanding, the past performance and behaviour score, and any information that is available from external credit bureaus or Barclays Bank. The collections team utilise a strategic decision making process to determine the timing and type of contact that will be made to the customer in respect of the delinquency. Efforts to deal with delinquent receivables occur at each stage of delinquency. Activities include statement messages, telephone calls, formal letters, SMS Text Messages, calling cards and telemessages. Accounts are automatically charged off at 180 days of delinquency unless there is specialist activity in place. An account may be charged off before it is 180 days delinquent. This decision is based upon an assessment of the likelihood of recovery and rehabilitation of the individual account and may occur at any point in the process. In certain circumstances, in particular bankruptcies are charged off on notification and deaths are charged off 90 days after notification. In addition, there are instances where accounts are not chargedoff after 180 days of delinquency because of the presence of specialist activities. Specialist activities include insurance claims, authorised user disputes, voucher disputes and complaints. Barclaycard may reduce the minim um repayment terms for an account and place the account on a repayment program if it is believed that this would improve the likelihood of returning the account to performing status. As part of any recovery activity, accounts may be passed to external debt collection agencies to seek recovery. Once chargedoff, a portion of the receivables are typically sold to debt collection agencies to maximise recoveries. Post chargeoff account rehabilitation may occur where improved credit circumstances and significant recovery occurs. However, charging privileges can only be reinstated once the cardholder has been accepted for a new account. In March 2007, Barclaycard performed a review of its financial and trust reporting methods in order to increase transparency and comparability of numbers. The review highlighted an overly conservative approach to repayment plan provisioning and a need to update to its delinquency reporting method to improve consistency. 62 Back to Contents As such, at the end of March 2007 the following changes were made to Barclaycards trust reporting: (a) Repayment plans that pay less than 1% ( <1% RPs ) of the balance outstanding per month: (i) Previously all <1% RPs were forced to age through delinquency to charge-offs whether they were paying as agreed or not. (ii) As at the end of March 2007 Barclaycards reporting policy was updated such that only <1% RPs not making minimum payments are reported as delinquent and flow through to charge-off. (b) Repayment plans that pay greater than 1% (> 1% RPs ) of the balance outstanding per month: (i) Previously any >1% RPs that were not paying as agreed were not reported as delinquent. However, they were reported correctly as charge-offs when payments had not been made for 180 days or more. (ii) As at the end of March 2007 Barclaycards reporting policy was updated such that any >1% RPs not paying as agreed are reported as delinquent. Each prospectus supplement/final terms will contain tables which set forth the delinquency and loss experience of Barclaycards Securitised Portfolio of VISA and MasterCard credit and charge card accounts denominated in pounds sterling  called the  Securitised Portfolio   including the historic contractual delinquencies of accounts in the Securitised Portfolio, broken down according to the number of days by which payments are overdue, as well as loss experience and provisions for bad and doubtful debt. The Securitised Portfolio includes platinum, gold and classic VISA and MasterCard credit cards and the Premier VISA charge card. The Securitised Portfolio currently does not include the portfolio of credit card accounts acquired by Barclaycard with Barclays PLCs purchase of Woolwich in October 2000 or the portfolio of credit card accounts purchased from Providians U.K. operations in April 2002 or the portfolio of store card accounts purchased from Clydesdale Financial Services in May 2003. The delinquency statistics are obtained from billing cycle information as opposed to month end positions. 63 Back to Contents THE RECEIVABLES Assignment of Receivables to the Receivables Trustee Under the terms of a Receivables Securitisation Agreement dated 23 November 1999 and amended and restated on 7 July 2000  which we will call the  Receivables Securitisation Agreement   Barclaycard as the initial originator offered on 23 November 1999  called the  Initial Relevant Closing Date   to the receivables trustee an assignment of all receivables that had arisen or would arise in accounts originated under the designated product lines, where such accounts were in existence on or before October 1999  called the  Pool Selection Date . Under a series of subsequent assignments, receivables arising on further accounts on designated product lines were assigned to the receivables trustee. Under the terms of a deed of assignment of receivables dated 7 July 2000, called the  Future Receivables Transfer , Barclaycard as initial originator assigned to the receivables trus tee all receivables that would arise on all accounts opened on or after 1 August 2000 on certain product lines identified (or to be identified) in the manner described in the next paragraph. An account of the initial originator will be designated as a  Designated Account  if the account has been originated under and continues to conform to the credit card and charge card products described in this base prospectus, comes within a product line named in an accepted offer or transfer and has not been identified on the initial originators system as being excluded from such accepted offer or transfer. Only credit and charge card products available to the originators individual account holders may be designated. Under the terms of the Future Receivables Transfer whenever Barclaycard creates a new product line, Barclaycard will be able, if it so chooses, to allocate to that product line one of the codes referred to in the Future Receivables Transfer, being a code which has not previously been allocated to any product line. By allocating, or not allocating, one of those codes to the new product line, Barclaycard will be able to choose whether or not to nominate the receivables on that product line as being included in the sale to the receivables trustee. If Barclaycard chooses to make a nomination, it will be able to do so by allocating one of the relevant product line codes to the product line in question. Once one of the relevant product line codes has been attached to a particular product line, all receivables arising thereafter on all accounts opened thereafter on that product line will be included in the sale to the receivables trustee subject to and in accordance wit h the terms of the Receivables Securitisation Agreement. Further, where Barclaycard acquires new portfolios of credit card accounts, it can elect to transfer those portfolios onto one of the product codes referred to in the Future Receivables Transfer, and if those accounts are eligible, to designate those accounts and to include the receivables arising on those accounts in the sale to the receivables trustee. If for any reason there are receivables from Designated Accounts that cannot be assigned to the receivables trustee, the originator will hold those receivables, and any collections on those receivables, on trust for the receivables trustee. These collections will be treated as if the receivables had been properly assigned. Under the terms of the Receivables Securitisation Agreement, the originator also has the right to select accounts that conform to the conditions in the first paragraph above and that are not designated and nominate them to be Designated Accounts by offering the receivables trustee an assignment of all future and existing receivables in these accounts. These accounts are called  Additional Accounts . An additional account will be treated as a Designated Account from the date on which its receivables are offered to the receivables trustee, assuming that such offer is accepted. This date is called the  Addition Date . When Additional Accounts are nominated the originator must, amongst other things: (i) provide the receivables trustee with a certificate stating that it is solvent; (ii) confirm, in the document that offers to assign the receivables in the Additional Accounts to the receivables trustee, that: (1) the offer of the receivables in the Additional Accounts meets the Maximum Addition Amount criteria; or (2) if the offer does not meet the Maximum Addition Amount criteria, the rating agencies have confirmed that the designation of Additional Accounts will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the current rating of any outstanding debt that is secured directly or indirectly by the receivables in the receivables trust, including your notes; 64 Back to Contents (iii) obtain a legal opinion addressed to the receivables trustee about any receivables from a jurisdiction outside of the United Kingdom; (iv) in relation to a nomination made in accordance with the terms of the Future Receivables Transfer, obtain a legal opinion addressed to the receivables trustee in respect of the Future Receivables Transfer in a form satisfactory to the receivables trustee. Any of these preconditions may be waived by the receivables trustee if the rating agencies confirm in writing that the waiver will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of their rating on any Related Beneficiary Debt. At the time that it is nominated, each additional account must also meet the eligibility criteria as at the time of its designation. These criteria are explained in  Representations  below. Additional accounts may have been originated or purchased using underwriting standards that are different from the underwriting standards used by Barclaycard in selecting the original Designated Accounts. As a result, Additional Accounts that are selected in future may not have the same credit quality.  Maximum Addition Amount  means, for any Addition Date, the number of Additional Accounts originated by the originator after the Pool Selection Date and nominated as Additional Accounts without prior rating agency confirmation that would either: (i) for any three consecutive monthly periods starting with the monthly period beginning on the first day of the month before the Pool Selection Date, exceed 15 per cent. of the number of Designated Accounts at the end of the ninth monthly period before the start of such three monthly periods; (ii) for any twelvemonth period, be equal to 20 per cent. of the Designated Accounts as of the first day of the twelvemonth period, or if later, as of the Pool Selection Date. Notwithstanding what we just said, if the total principal balance of receivables in the Additional Accounts described in either of the two prior bullet points is more than either: (1) 15 per cent. of the total amount of eligible principal receivables determined as of the later of the Pool Selection Date and the first day of the third preceding monthly period, minus the amount of eligible principal receivables in each additional account that was nominated since the later of the Initial Relevant Closing Date and the first day of the third preceding monthly period  calculated for each additional account on its Addition Date; or (2) 20 per cent. of the total amount of eligible principal receivables as of the later of the Initial Relevant Closing Date and the first day of the calendar year in which the Addition Date occurs, minus the total amount of eligible principal receivables in each additional account that was nominated since the later of the Initial Relevant Closing Date and the first day of the calendar year, calculated for each additional account as of its Addition Date, then the Maximum Addition Amount will be the lesser of (1) or (2) above. Every offer of receivables to the receivables trustee under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement will comprise offers of the following: (i) all existing receivables in the Designated Accounts; (ii) all future principal receivables under the Designated Accounts, until the first to occur of (1) the time a Designated Account becomes a Redesignated Account, (2) the receivables trust is terminated or (3) an Insolvency Event occurs; (iii) all future finance charge receivables under those Designated Accounts that have accrued on receivables that have been assigned to the receivables trustee as described in the two prior bullet points; 65 Back to Contents (iv) if capable of being assigned, the benefit of any guarantee or insurance policy obtained by the originator for any obligations owed by a cardholder on a Designated Account; and (v) the benefit of all amounts representing Acquired Interchange for the relevant monthly period. The originator will ensure that each Redesignated Account is identified on the originators computer system on the date that a Designated Account becomes a Redesignated Account. Throughout the term of the receivables trust, the Designated Accounts from which the receivables will arise will be the Designated Accounts plus any Additional Accounts designated by the originator from time to time, minus any Redesignated Accounts. Existing receivables and future receivables arising under the Designated Accounts are either principal receivables or finance charge receivables.  Principal Receivables  are receivables that are not finance charge receivables. Principal Receivables are amounts owing by cardholders for the purchase of merchandise or services and from cash advances, including foreign exchange commissions charged for merchandise and services payable, or cash advances denominated in, a currency other than sterling. They are reduced by any credit balance on the Designated Account on that day.  Finance Charge Receivables  are amounts owing from cardholders for transaction fees, periodic finance charges, special fees and annual fees  see   Special Fees and Annual Fees  below  and any Interchange and Discount Option Receivables. Under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement, each offer of receivables made by the originator may be accepted by paying the purchase price for the offered receivables. If the receivables trustee chooses to accept the offer, payment for existing receivables has to be made no later than the Business Day following the date on which the offer is made. Alternatively, the parties can agree to a longer period of time for payment. Payment for future receivables that become existing receivables must be made no later than two Business Days after the date of processing for those receivables. Alternatively, the parties can agree to a longer period if the rating agencies consent. Payment is made monthly for the assignment of the benefit of Acquired Interchange to the receivables trustee. A  Business Day  is a day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in London, England, or New York, New York are authorised or obliged by law or executive order to be closed. It was agreed between the originator and the receivables trustee that, for the purposes of the offer made on the Initial Relevant Closing Date: (1) the receivables trustee was entitled to use the collections in the Designated Accounts before the date that the offer was accepted as if the offer had been accepted on the Initial Relevant Closing Date; (2) the amount paid on the Initial Relevant Closing Date for the Designated Accounts equalled the outstanding face amount of all existing principal receivables, together with an obligation of the receivables trustee to pay for all future receivables generated on the Designated Accounts that were part of the offer on an ongoing, daily basis when those future receivables are generated. The payments in (2) are net of any payments made in (1), subject to a minimum of £1. The amount payable by the receivables trustee to the originator if it chooses to accept an offer or to make payment for any future receivables will be reduced by the amount of any shortfall in the amount funded by the originator as a beneficiary, providing that the Originator Interest is increased accordingly. Redesignation and Removal of Accounts Each Designated Account will continue to be a Designated Account until such time as the originator reclassifies it as being no longer a Designated Accountcalled a  Redesignated Account . A Designated Account becomes a Redesignated Account on the date specified by the originator. No Designated Account will become a Redesignated Account this way unless (1) it has become a 66 Back to Contents Cancelled Account, a Defaulted Account or a Zero Balance Account or (2) the originator delivers an officers certificate confirming the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the redesignation will not cause a Pay Out Event to occur; (ii) the originator has represented that its selection procedures for the selection of Designated Accounts for redesignation are not believed to have any material adverse effect on any investor beneficiary; (iii) the rating agencies have confirmed that the action will not result in a downgrade in rating of any outstanding debt that is secured directly or indirectly by the receivables in the receivables trust; and (iv) the originator and the servicer can certify that collections equal to the outstanding face amount of each principal receivable and the outstanding balance of each finance charge receivable have been received by the receivables trustee on all receivables assigned for that account other than any receivables charged off as uncollectible. A  Cancelled Account  is a Designated Account that has had its charging privileges permanently withdrawn. A  Defaulted Account  is a Designated Account where the receivables have been charged off by the servicer as uncollectible in line with the credit and charge card guidelines or the usual servicing procedures of the servicer for similar credit and charge card accounts. A  Zero Balance Account  is a Designated Account that has had a nil balance of receivables for a considerable period of time and has been identified by the servicer as a Zero Balance Account under the credit and charge card guidelines or the usual servicing procedures of the servicer. Redesignated Accounts include all accounts that become Cancelled Accounts, Defaulted Accounts and Zero Balance Accounts from the date on which they are redesignated in any of these ways. The principal receivables that exist before the date of redesignation will be paid for by the receivables trustee. Any future receivables that come into existence after that time will not be assigned to the receivables trustee as set out in the Receivables Securitisation Agreement. No receivable that has been assigned to the receivables trustee will be reassigned to the originator except in the limited circumstances described under the heading   Representations . Until money has been received for the assigned receivables that have not been charged off, a Redesignated Account will not be identified as having been removed. The amount identified will be equal to the outstanding face amount of each principal receivable and finance charge receivable. Once these payments have been received or any reassignment has occurred, the account will be identified to indicate that it has become a Redesignated Account. Discount Option Receivables The originator may, by giving at least thirty days prior notice to the servicer, the receivables trustee and the rating agencies, nominate a fixed or variable percentage  called the  Discount Percentage   of principal receivables in the Designated Accounts. If a Discount Percentage has been nominated previously, an extension to the period for which it applies can be applied for in the same way. From the date and for the length of time stated in the notice: (i) the amount payable by the receivables trustee to accept an offer of receivables will be reduced by a percentage amount equal to the Discount Percentage; and (ii) a percentage of the principal receivables equal to the Discount Percentage will be treated by the receivables trustee as finance charge receivables. These are called  Discount Option Receivables . The nomination of a Discount Percentage or increase in the time it is in place will be effective only if the rating agencies consent to the proposed nomination or increase and confirm that it will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the current rating of any debt that is secured directly or indirectly by the receivables in the receivables trust, including your notes. The originator must also provide the receivables trustee with a certificate confirming: (i) that the performance of the portfolio of Designated Accounts, in their reasonable opinion, is not generating adequate cash flows for the beneficiaries of the receivables trust and the size of the 67 Back to Contents Discount Percentage is not intended solely to accelerate distributions to the excess interest beneficiary; and (ii) that the originator is solvent and will remain so following the nomination or increase. The originator may have different reasons to designate a Discount Percentage. The finance charge collections on the Designated Accounts may decline for various reasons or may stay constant. The notes have interest rates that are variable and that could increase. Any of these variables could cause a Pay Out Event to occur based in part on the amount of finance charge collections and the interest rate on the notes. The originator could avoid the occurrence of this Pay Out Event by designating a Discount Percentage, causing an increase in the amount of finance charge collections. The originator, however, is under no obligation to designate a Discount Percentage and we cannot assure you that the originator would designate a Discount Percentage to avoid a Pay Out Event. Special Fees and Annual Fees The originator charges special fees  currently late and over limit fees  on its credit or charge card accounts. These special fees as well as additional special fees may be assessed at one time or on an ongoing basis. Certain of the receivables assigned or to be assigned to the receivables trustee include annual fees on a small number of the Designated Accounts. Any special fees and annual fees that are charged on Designated Accounts are regarded as finance charge receivables and collections of these special fees are treated as finance charge collections. The originator may, however, decide that these special fees or annual fees will be viewed as principal receivables and collections on them will be allocated accordingly. This can be done only if the originator certifies that it has an opinion from legal counsel that the special fees or annual fees amount to repayment, for United Kingdom tax purposes, in whole or in part of an advance to a cardholder. Interchange Members participating in the VISA and MasterCard associations receive fees called  Interchange  as partial compensation, for amongst other things, taking credit risk and absorbing fraud losses. Under the VISA and MasterCard systems, Interchange is passed from the banks that clear the transactions for merchants to card issuing banks. Interchange fees are calculated as a percentage of the amount of a credit or charge card transaction for the purchase of goods or services. This percentage varies from time to time. On each Transfer Date the originator will deposit into the Trustee Collection Account an amount equal to the Interchange received for the preceding monthly period. This amount is called the  Acquired Interchange . Interchange is received by Barclaycard on a daily basis and is posted to the general ledger with a flag identifying the product to which it relates. The amount of Acquired Interchange applicable to the receivables in the trust is arrived at monthly by interrogation of the general ledger. All Interchange relating to products included in the trust is extracted and posted to the Trustee Collection Account. A  Transfer Date  is, with respect to any series, the Business Day immediately prior to each Distribution Date, unless otherwise specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Reductions in Receivables, Early Collections and Credit Adjustments If a principal receivable that has been assigned to the receivables trustee is reduced  for reasons other than because of Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act or a credit adjustment  after the offer date because of setoff, counterclaim or any other matter between the cardholder and the originator, and the originator has received a benefit, then the originator will pay an amount equal to that reduction to the receivables trustee. Similarly, if an existing receivable has already been assigned and the originator has received full or partial payment of that receivable before the date that the receivable was purportedly assigned, then the originator will pay the amount of that collection to the receivables trustee. If any principal receivable assigned to the receivables trustee is reduced for credit adjustment reasons after the offer date, then the originator will pay that amount to the receivables trustee. A credit adjustment is the outstanding face amount of a principal receivable that: (i) was created by virtue of a sale of merchandise that was subsequently refused or returned by a cardholder or against which the cardholder has asserted any defence, dispute, setoff or counterclaim; 68 Back to Contents (ii) is reduced because the cardholder had received a rebate, refund, chargeback or adjustment; or (iii) is fraudulent or counterfeit. Alternatively, instead of paying these amounts to the receivables trustee, the originator can reduce the Originator Interest by the amount of the credit adjustment, but not below zero. Representations Each offer of receivables to the receivables trustee under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement and the Future Receivables Transfer includes representations by the originator about the offer or transfer of the existing receivables and the future receivables. The representations for the existing receivables were or will be given as of the Pool Selection Date or an Addition Date, as applicable, and the representations for the future receivables are given on the date they are processed, and include, in each case, that: (i) unless identified as an Ineligible Receivable, the receivable is an Eligible Receivable and has arisen from an Eligible Account in the amount specified in the offer or daily activity report, as applicable; (ii) each assignment passes good and marketable title for that receivable to the receivables trustee, together with the benefit of all collections and other rights in connection with it, free from encumbrances of any person claiming on it through the originator to the receivables and, unless such receivable does not comply with the Consumer Credit Act, nothing further needs to be done to enforce these rights in the courts of England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, or any Permitted Additional Jurisdiction, without the participation of the originator, except for payment of any United Kingdom stamp duty and giving a Notice of Assignment to the cardholders and subject to any limitations arising on enforcement in the jurisdiction of the relevant cardholder; and (iii) the assignment complies with all applicable laws on the date of assignment. If a representation relating to the eligibility criteria given in connection with any principal receivable proves to be incorrect when made, then the originator is obliged to pay the receivables trustee an amount equal to the face value of that receivable on the following Business Day. A receivable of this type will afterwards be treated as an Ineligible Receivable. The originators obligation to pay amounts due as a result of any breach of a representation can be fulfilled, in whole or in part, by a reduction in the amount of the Originator Interest. The Originator Interest, however, may not be reduced below zero. If the originator meets a payment obligation in this way, the receivables trustee will have no further claim against the originator for the breached representation. However, a breach of a representation may result in a Series Pay Out Event. If: (i) all principal receivables arising under a Designated Account become ineligible as a result of incorrect representations; (ii) that account has become a Redesignated Account; and (iii) the originator has complied with the payment obligations for the principal receivables; then the originator can require the receivables trustee to reassign all those receivables to the originator. The receivables trustee has not made and will not make any initial or periodic examination of the receivables to determine if they are Eligible Accounts or if the originators representations and warranties are true. The term  Eligible Account  means, as of the Pool Selection Date, an Addition Date or date on which the account is opened, as applicable, a credit or charge card account: (i) where the cardholder is not a company or partnership for the purposes of Section 349(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988; 69 Back to Contents (ii) which, except in the case of a future Designated Account as defined in any offer or a relevant account as defined in the Future Receivables Transfer, was in existence and maintained with the originator before it became a Designated Account; (iii) which is payable in pounds sterling or the currency of the Permitted Additional Jurisdiction where the account is in a Permitted Additional Jurisdiction, as applicable; (iv) which is governed by one of the originators standard form card agreements or, if it was acquired by the originator, it is originated on contractual terms not materially different from that standard form; (v) which is governed in whole or in part by the Consumer Credit Act and creates legal, valid and binding obligations between the originator and the cardholder which, except in the case of an account on which Restricted Eligible Receivables arise, is enforceable against the cardholder in accordance with the relevant card agreement and the Consumer Credit Act, subject to bankruptcy laws, general principles of equity and limitations on enforcement in any cardholder jurisdiction and was otherwise created and complies with all other applicable laws; (vi) where the cardholders most recent billing address is located in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, or a Permitted Additional Jurisdiction or a Restricted Additional Jurisdiction; (vii) which has not been classified by the originator as counterfeit, cancelled, fraudulent, stolen or lost; (viii) which has been originated or purchased by the originator; (ix) which has been operated in all material respects in accordance with the originators policies and procedures and usual practices for the operation of its credit and charge card business; and (x) the receivables in respect of which have not been charged off by the originator on the date the account is specified as a Designated Account. If all these conditions have not been satisfied, then an account may still be an Eligible Account if each rating agency gives their approval. A  Restricted Eligible Receivable  is a receivable arising on an Eligible Account, the terms of which fail to comply with the Consumer Credit Act, such that a court would have no discretion to grant a court order. A  Defaulted Receivable  is any receivable in a Defaulted Account. A  Permitted Additional Jurisdiction  is a jurisdiction  other than England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland  agreed by the originator and the receivables trustee, and which each rating agency has confirmed in writing that its inclusion as a Permitted Additional Jurisdiction will not result in its withdrawing or reducing its rating on any Related Beneficiary Debt. A  Restricted Additional Jurisdiction  is a jurisdiction  other than England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland or a Permitted Additional Jurisdiction  which together with each other account with a billing address in that jurisdiction and any other jurisdiction other than England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or a Permitted Additional Jurisdiction represent less than 5 per cent. by outstanding receivables balance. A  Notice of Assignment  means a notice given to a cardholder of the assignment of the receivables  and the benefit of any guarantees  to the receivables trustee. An  Eligible Receivable  means a receivable that: (i) has arisen under an Eligible Account; (ii) was originated under one of the originators standard form credit or charge card agreements and is governed, in whole or in part, by the Consumer Credit Act, or else, if the related account was acquired by the originator, contractual terms that are materially the same as the standard form credit or charge card agreements and are governed, in whole or in part, by the Consumer Credit Act; 70 Back to Contents (iii) was otherwise created in compliance with all other applicable laws; (iv) was originated in accordance with the originators policies and procedures and usual practices for its credit and charge card business; (v) is not a Defaulted Receivable as at the offer date or Addition Date, as applicable; (vi) is free of any encumbrances exercisable against the originator arising under or through the originator or any of its affiliates; (vii) to which the originator has good and marketable title; (viii) is the legal obligation of the cardholder, enforceable  except in the case of Restricted Eligible Receivables  in accordance with the terms of the credit or charge card agreement, subject to bankruptcy, general principles of equity and limitations on enforcement in any cardholder jurisdiction; and (ix) is not currently subject to any defence, dispute, event, setoff, counterclaim or enforcement order. As is market practice in the United Kingdom for credit and charge card securitisation transactions, principal receivables that are delinquent will still constitute Eligible Receivables if they comply with the eligibility requirements. See the table captioned  Delinquency Experience  Securitised Portfolio  in  Barclaycard and the Barclaycard Card Portfolio  Delinquency and Loss Experience  in the accompanying prospectus supplement/final terms for data showing the percentage of delinquent receivables.  Ineligible Receivables  means principal receivables which arise under a Designated Account but which do not comply with all the criteria set out in the definition of Eligible Receivables as at the Pool Selection Date or an Addition Date, as applicable. Amendments to Card Agreements and Card Guidelines The originator may amend the terms and conditions of its standard form card agreements or change its policies and procedures and usual practices for its general card business. These amendments may include reducing or increasing the amount of monthly minimum required payments or may involve changes to periodic finance charges or other charges that would apply to the Designated Accounts. See  Risk Factors: A Change in the Terms of the Designated Accounts May Adversely Affect the Amount or Timing of Collections and May Cause an Early Redemption of Your Notes or a Downgrade of Your Notes . Overview of Securitised Portfolio Each prospectus supplement/final terms relating to a series of notes will contain tables summarising information in relation to Designated Accounts on which receivables that have been assigned to the Receivables Trustee arise. The tables will contain information in relation to the various criteria as of a particular date that is relevant to such prospectus supplement/final terms. The tables will indicate, among other things, composition by account balance, composition by credit limit, composition by period of delinquency, composition by account age and geographic distribution of accounts. 71 Back to Contents MATURITY ASSUMPTIONS On each Transfer Date during the Controlled Accumulation Period an amount equal to the Controlled Deposit Amount will be deposited in the Principal Funding Account until the balance of the Principal Funding Account equals the investor interest. Although it is anticipated that principal collections will be available on each Transfer Date during the Controlled Accumulation Period to make a deposit of the Controlled Deposit Amount and that the investor interest will be paid to the MTN issuing entity on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date, allowing the MTN issuing entity to redeem the medium term note certificate fully, no assurance can be given that sufficient principal collections will be available. If the amount required to pay the investor interest in full is not available on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date, a Series Pay Out Event will occur and the Rapid Amortisation Period will begin. If a Regulated Amortisation Trigger Event occurs during the Controlled Accumulation Period, the Regulated Amortisation Period will begin. If any other Pay Out Event occurs during the Controlled Accumulation Period, the Rapid Amortisation Period will begin. In each case, any amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account will be paid to the MTN issuing entity for the investor interest on the first payment date relating to the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period. In addition, to the extent that the investor interest for each class has not been distributed in full, the MTN issuing entity will be entitled to monthly distributions of principal collections during the Rapid Amortisation Period equal to the Available Investor Principal Collections until the investor interest has been distributed in full or, during the Regulated Amortisation Period, an amount equal to the Controlled Deposit Amount until the investor interest has been distributed in full. A Pay Out Event occurs, either automatically or after specified notice, after a Trust Pay Out Event or a Series Pay Out Event occurs. See  The Receivables Trust: Trust Pay Out Events and Securitisation Cashflows: Series Pay Out Events . If a Series Pay Out Event occurs, it will automatically trigger an early redemption event under the medium term note certificate. Each prospectus supplement/final terms will contain a table that presents the highest and lowest cardholder monthly payment rates for the bank portfolio during any month in the period shown and the average cardholder monthly payment rates for all months during the periods shown. These are calculated as a percentage of total opening receivables balances during the periods shown. The payment rates are based on amounts which would be deemed payments of principal collections and finance charge collections for the related accounts. Collections may vary from month to month due to: (i) seasonal variations; (ii) promotional offerings  such as payment holidays; (iii) general economic conditions; and (iv) payment habits of individual cardholders. There is no guarantee that the future monthly payment rates for the Securitised Portfolio will be similar to the historical experience set forth in each prospectus supplement/final terms or that there will be enough principal collections to deposit the Controlled Deposit Amount into the Principal Funding Account each month to fully redeem your notes by the Series Scheduled Redemption Date. If a Pay Out Event occurs, the average life and maturity of your notes could be significantly reduced, since you may start receiving principal distributions before the Series Scheduled Redemption Date. Because there may be a slowdown in the payment rate below the payment rates used to determine the Controlled Deposit Amount or a Pay Out Event may occur which would start the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, there is no guarantee that the actual number of months elapsed from the relevant closing date to the final Distribution Date for your notes will equal the expected number of months. As described under  Securitisation Cashflows: Postponement of Controlled Accumulation Period , if the servicer shortens the Controlled Accumulation Period there is no guarantee that there will be enough time to accumulate all amounts necessary to fully pay the investor interest on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date. See  Risk Factors: Principal on your Notes May Be Paid Earlier Than Expected Creating a Reinvestment Risk to You or Later than Expected . 72 Back to Contents RECEIVABLES YIELD CONSIDERATIONS The gross revenues from finance charges and fees billed to accounts in the portfolio of credit and charge card accounts for the most recent available periods will be presented in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. Prior to the creation of the receivables trust, Barclaycard recorded yield information on an accruals basis, which includes earned but not necessarily paid finance charges and fees. A system change to allocate cash in priority against finance charges ahead of principal was made in October 1999. This resulted in increased yield in 2000. Cash yields from 2000 onwards include principal and interest recovered on charged­off accounts, which typically results in higher cash yields than accrual yields. Yield information is calculated by allocating cash in priority against finance charges ahead of principal in line with the Barclaycard standard billing processes. The yield will be affected by many factors, including the monthly periodic finance charges on the receivables, the amount of the annual fees and other fees, changes in the delinquency rate on the receivables and the percentage of cardholders who pay their balances in full each month and do not incur monthly periodic finance charges. For example, the originator could change the monthly interest rate applied to the accounts or reduce or eliminate fees on the accounts. See  Risk Factor: A Change in the Terms of the Receivables May Adversely Affect the Amount or Timing of Collections and May Cause an Early Redemption or a Downgrade of Your Notes . The table presented in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms will set forth the revenue for the Securitised Portfolio of card accounts. The revenue is comprised of monthly periodic finance charges, card fees, special fees, annual fees and Interchange. These revenues vary for each account based on the type and volume of activity for each account. See  Barclaycard and the Barclaycard Card Portfolio . 73 Back to Contents THE RECEIVABLES TRUST General Legal Structure The receivables trust was constituted on 1 November 1999 and is a trust formed under English law by the receivables trustee as trustee and Barclays as trust cash manager, initial originator, initial originator beneficiary and excess interest beneficiary. The receivables trust was declared for the financings described in this base prospectus. The terms and conditions of the receivables trust are contained in the declaration of trust dated 1 November 1999 as amended and restated by the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement dated 23 November 1999, and supplemented by the series supplements to the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement, which are governed by English law. This section will describe to you the material terms of the receivables trust and declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement. The terms of the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement may be varied or added to by executing a supplemen t  but only for the series of Investor Certificates issued under the supplement. A precondition to the receivables trustee entering into a supplement is obtaining confirmation from the rating agencies that entering into the supplement will not result in any rating agency withdrawing or downgrading its rating of any debt that is ultimately secured by the receivables in the receivables trust. Under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement, the receivables trustee holds all of the receivables trusts property on trust for: (i) the initial originator beneficiary and the excess interest beneficiary as the initial beneficiaries of the trust; and (ii) for any other person who may become an additional originator beneficiary or additional beneficiary of the trust as allowed by the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement. Other than the excess interest beneficiary and an originator beneficiary, the two categories of beneficiary are: (i) an investor beneficiary, which may include any investor beneficiary subordinate to another investor beneficiary as a provider of credit enhancement; or (ii) an enhancement provider for a series of Investor Certificates, if provided for in the supplement for that series. The excess interest beneficiary and the initial originator beneficiary are the initial beneficiaries of the receivables trust. Any subsidiary of the initial originator that, with the prior written consent of all existing beneficiaries of the receivables trust, accedes to the Receivables Securitisation Agreement as an additional originator will upon its accession become an additional originator beneficiary of the receivables trust. By making payments to the receivables trustee as a contribution to the receivables trusts property, as set out in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement, other persons can form a series of the receivables trust. These persons are called additional beneficiaries. When payment is made, the additional beneficiaries will be given a certificate evidencing a beneficial interest in the receivables trust to show that they are an investor. This process is called an acquisition and the certificate is called an Investor Certificate. When an acquisition takes place a notice will be given that will list the parties to the acquisition. A new series supplement will govern each new series of the receivables trust that is created. Two types of acquisitions may be made: (i) the originator beneficiary may direct the receivables trustee, in exchange for tendering the certificate it holds showing its entitlement to the receivables trusts property  called the  Originator Certificate   to issue a new series of Investor Certificates and to reissue the Originator Certificate evidencing the originators beneficial entitlement to the receivables trusts property. This is known as a  Originator Acquisition . Twelve series of Investor Certificates have been previously issued by the receivables trust and were created by an Originator Acquisition. The first series Investor Certificate (for series 99-1) is no longer in existence as series 99-1 was fully paid out in November 2002. The second series Investor Certificate (for series 02-1) is no longer in existence as series 02-1 was fully paid out in October 2007. The third series Investor Certificate (for series 03-1) is no longer in existence as series 03-1 was fully paid 74 Back to Contents out in March 2008. The fourth series Investor Certificate (for series 03-2) is no longer in existence as series 03-2 was fully paid out in June 2006. The fifth series Investor Certificate (for series 03-3) is no longer in existence as series 03-3 was fully paid out in August 2006. The sixth series Investor Certificate (for series 04-1) is no longer in existence as series 04-1 was fully paid out in February 2007. The seventh series Investor Certificate (for series 04-2) is no longer in existence as series 04-2 was fully paid out in November 2007. (ii) the second type of acquisition which may be made is an investor acquisition where, if the supplement permits, an investor beneficiary together with the originator beneficiary may direct the receivables trustee, in exchange for tendering their Investor Certificates and the Originator Certificate to issue one or more new Investor Certificates and a reissued Originator Certificate. The receivables trustee will authenticate and deliver a series of Investor Certificates only when it has first received: (i) a supplement signed by the parties to the new series, including the receivables trustee and the originator beneficiary, specifying the principal terms of the series; (ii) a solvency certificate from the originator and any additional originators; (iii) written confirmation from the rating agencies that the proposed acquisition will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of their ratings on any notes issued by the issuing entity or any other issuing entity of any series of notes that is ultimately secured by the receivables in the receivables trust  called  Related Beneficiary Debt ; (iv) written confirmation from each additional beneficiary and enhancement provider, if any, that: (1) its usual place of abode is in the United Kingdom and it will be within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax for all amounts regarded as interest for U.K. tax purposes received by it under the transactions contemplated by the series of Investor Certificates; or (2) it is a bank, as defined for purposes of section 879 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and it will be within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax for all amounts regarded as interest for U.K. tax purposes received by it under the series of Investor Certificates; (v) the existing Originator Certificate and, if it is an investor acquisition, the applicable Investor Certificates; (vi) an officers certificate provided by the originator certifying either: (1) that: (a) each class of Related Beneficiary Debt issued as part of the acquisition and described in the related supplement will be rated in one of the three highest rating categories by at least one rating agency recognised in the United Kingdom; (b) each investor beneficiary  other than any enhancement provider  will have associated with it, either directly or indirectly, a class of Related Beneficiary Debt; and (c) the enhancement for each series will be provided by any combination of subordination, a letter of credit, a cash collateral loan, a surety bond, an insurance policy, or a series cash reserve account funded from excess finance charge collections ultimately reverting to the excess interest beneficiary or originator to the extent not utilised as enhancement, but through no other means; or (2) it has determined that, based on legal advice, the acquisition is in the best interests of the originator beneficiary and its affiliates. Each series supplement will specify the principal terms for its series of Investor Certificates, including the accumulation period or amortisation period for the payment of principal. For each series 75 Back to Contents these may be of different lengths and begin on different dates. Enhancement is specific to each series and will be held and used by the receivables trustee only for the benefit of the relevant series. Certain series may be subordinated to other series, and classes within a series may have different priorities. Whether or not a series or class is subordinated will be set out in the related supplement. There will be no limit on the number of acquisitions that may be performed. The receivables trustee will not be able to arrange for additional supplements without obtaining the consent of all the beneficiaries constituting each existing series. Even if the receivables trustee receives all these consents, no acquisition will be effective unless the rating agencies confirm that the additional supplement will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of their rating of any Related Beneficiary Debt. The Receivables Trusts Property The property of the receivables trust will include all present and future receivables located on the Triumph accounting system or any other accounting system used by the originator from time to time, arising under all MasterCard and VISA credit and charge card accounts of Barclaycards individual cardholders on designated product lines that have not been identified as nonDesignated Accounts and that are denominated in pounds sterling with a billing address within England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or a Permitted Additional Jurisdiction or a Restricted Additional Jurisdiction. We refer to these accounts as the  Designated Accounts . See  The Receivables: Representations . The receivables have been and will continue to be assigned to the receivables trustee under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement between Barclaycard as originator and the receivables trustee. The Receivables Securitisation Agreement is governed b y English law. Occasionally some accounts may be removed from the pool of Designated Accounts. These accounts we refer to in this base prospectus as the  Redesignated Accounts . Other than Ineligible Receivables (which are held separately, solely for the benefit of the originator beneficiary as described below) and certain amounts that are held in segregated accounts for the benefit of particular beneficiaries, the property of the receivables trustee is held on trust on an undivided basis for all beneficiaries. The originator is required to ensure that any of Barclaycards credit and charge card accounts that are to be excluded from or otherwise outside the scope of the offer or transfer to the receivables trustee under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement or that are to be removed from the pool of Designated Accounts are identified on its computer system prior to the date of offer or the date of transfer. The property of the receivables trust will also include: (i) all monies due in payment of the receivables under Designated Accounts from time to time; (ii) all proceeds of the receivables and proceeds of any guarantees and insurance policies for the receivables  to the extent that they are capable of assignment  including proceeds of disposals by the receivables trustee of chargedoff receivables to Barclaycard; (iii) the benefit of any Acquired Interchange; see  The Receivables: Interchange ; (iv) all monies on deposit in the Trust Accounts; (v) any credit enhancement for the benefit of any series or class of beneficiary; and (vi) all monies provided by beneficiaries of the receivables trust to fund the purchase of receivables, until these monies are applied as intended. The receivables are divided into Eligible Receivables and Ineligible Receivables. Each investor beneficiary, the excess interest beneficiary and the originator beneficiary are beneficially entitled to interests in the pool of Eligible Receivables. The originator beneficiary is beneficially entitled to the entire pool of Ineligible Receivables and is solely entitled to all collections of Ineligible Receivables. 76 Back to Contents The total amount of the interest of the originator beneficiary in the receivables trust is called the  Originator Interest  and reflects the originator beneficiarys entitlement to principal receivables not allocated to each outstanding series. General Entitlement of Beneficiaries to Trust Property The originator beneficiary and each investor beneficiary will acquire undivided interests (or will increase their existing undivided interests) in the receivables trust by (in the case of the originator beneficiary) assigning receivables to the receivables trustee and accepting such undivided interest in full or partial settlement of the purchase price payable for such assignments or (in the case of an investor beneficiary) making a payment to the receivables trustee. The beneficiaries of the receivables trust are each beneficially entitled to share in the receivables trusts property and each beneficiary has or will acquire interests in the pool of Eligible Receivables  called the  Eligible Receivables Pool . See  Securitisation Cashflows  for a description of the beneficial entitlement of the issuing entity to receivables and for a description of the manner in which collections will be allocated to the issuing entity. Under the receivables trust as originally created, the beneficial entitlement of Barclaycard as the excess interest beneficiary to the property of the receivables trust at any time was called the  Excess Interest . The Excess Interest consisted of a beneficial entitlement to the residue of the finance charge collections and Acquired Interchange apportioned to any series for each monthly period after amounts have been allocated to each beneficiary forming part of that series or group of series, if applicable, and have been used to make payments to the enhancement provider, if it were not a beneficiary. These payments will include amounts deemed to represent finance charge collections as stated in the supplement for the series. Because Barclaycard may transfer its entitlement to the portion of the Excess Interest attributable to each series to the MTN issuing entity, the portion of the Excess Interest attributable to each series will be paid to the MTN issuing entity. To understand the beneficial entitlement of the originator beneficiary and each additional originator beneficiary you have to understand the definition of  Originator Percentage . The Originator Percentage is the percentage equal to 100 per cent. less the sum of the applicable Investor Percentages of each outstanding series. The aggregate beneficial entitlement of the originator beneficiary at any time consists of the following: (i) the Originator Percentage of eligible principal receivables; the Originator Percentage is calculated for this purpose using the Floating Investor Percentage for the Investor Percentage of each series; (ii) the Originator Percentage of finance charge receivables; the Originator Percentage is calculated for this purpose using the Floating Investor Percentage as the Investor Percentage for each series; (iii) all Ineligible Receivables; and (iv) all monies held in the Trust Accounts that represent investment earnings on permitted investments made using monies deposited in those Trust Accounts, unless something else is provided for in the supplement.  Permitted Investments  means the following: (i) demand or time deposits, certificates of deposit and other shortterm unsecured debt obligations at or of any institution that has unsecured and unguaranteed debt obligations of A1+ and P1 by Standard & Poors and Moodys; and (ii) shortterm unsecured debt obligations  including commercial paper  issued or guaranteed by any body corporate whose unsecured and unguaranteed debt obligations are A1+ and P1 by Standard & Poors and Moodys. The aggregate beneficial entitlement of the originator beneficiary to any other trust property at any time is equal to the proportion that the Originator Interest bears to the amount of eligible principal 77 Back to Contents receivables at that time. The initial originator beneficiarys and each additional originator beneficiarys entitlement to the aggregate beneficial entitlement of the originator beneficiary is equal to its proportionate share described in the Originator Certificate. Allocation and Application of Collections The following accounts have been opened by the receivables trustee at 1234 Pavilion Drive, Northampton, NN4 7SG, England: (i) a collection account called the  Trustee Collection Account , which is where principal collections and finance charge collections are credited; and (ii) the acquisition account called the  Trustee Acquisition Account , which is where amounts are credited that can be used to purchase beneficial interests in receivables for the investor or originator beneficiaries. The Trustee Acquisition Account, the Trustee Collection Account and any additional bank accounts of the receivables trust that the receivables trustee may open for particular beneficiaries are collectively called  Trust Accounts . The receivables trustee will have legal title to the funds on deposit in each Trust Account. Collections from cardholders for Designated Accounts and cardholders for other card accounts of Barclaycard are initially paid to Barclaycards bank accounts before being cleared on a sameday basis to a bank account called the  Barclaycard Operating Account . The Barclaycard Operating Account is currently held by Barclaycard at its branch located at 1234 Pavilion Drive, Northampton NN4 7SG, England. The originator has declared a trust over the Barclaycard Operating Account. All money in the Barclaycard Operating Account will be held on trust for the receivables trustee and transferred to the Trustee Collection Account within three Business Days after processing. All money in the Trustee Collection Account will be treated as collections from receivables of Designated Accounts unless it has been incorrectly paid into the account. Incorrect payments will be deducted from the appropriate collections on the Business Day on which the error is notified to the receivables trustee. Amounts incorrectly categorised as principal collections of Eligible Receivables but which are really collections of Ineligible Receivables will be given back to the originator beneficiary, after making adjustments for errors but before allocating amounts of principal collections that are property of the receivables trust. The receivables trustee will treat all money deposited in the Trustee Collection Account as property of the receivables trust unless notified otherwise by the trust cash manager. The Eligible Receivables Pool and the Originator Interest are increased or decreased, as applicable, to account for the errors made. Eligible principal receivables in Defaulted Accounts are allocated between the originator beneficiary and each series of Investor Certificates in accordance with their respective beneficial entitlements to the property of the receivables trust at the time the account becomes a Defaulted Account. Credit adjustments for principal receivables are allocated to the originator beneficiary as a reduction of the Originator Interest until the Originator Interest reaches zero. Ineligible principal receivables in Defaulted Accounts reduce the originators interest in Ineligible Receivables  called the  Originator Ineligible Interest   until it reaches zero. Collections that are property of the receivables trust are categorised as: (i) principal collections; (ii) finance charge collections; or (iii) ineligible collections. If a Discount Percentage is nominated by the originator, the Discount Percentage of principal collections will be treated as finance charge collections. The originator has no current intention to nominate a Discount Percentage. See  The Receivables: Discount Option Receivables . 78 Back to Contents If the related supplement says so, each series will also be entitled to a portion of Acquired Interchange. To the extent that any Acquired Interchange is not allocated to all those series, it will be allocated to the originator beneficiary. Each series will be entitled to receive varying percentages of principal collections, finance charge collections and receivables in Defaulted Accounts. Each of these percentages is called an  Investor Percentage . The originator beneficiary will be entitled to its applicable Originator Percentage of principal collections and finance charge collections and receivables in Defaulted Accounts. The excess interest beneficiary is entitled to finance charge collections allocated to a series that are not allocated to: (i) any other beneficiary, whether or not a member of that series; or (ii) any enhancement provider, as set out in the supplement relating to that series. Each supplement will set out, for its series, the entitlement of each investor beneficiary to principal collections, finance charge collections and Acquired Interchange. The originator may fulfil any obligation to make payments to the receivables trustee for principal receivables for which it has breached a warranty by: (i) reducing the Originator Interest  but not below zero; and (ii) increasing the Originator Ineligible Interest. However, if the Originator Interest would be reduced below zero, the originator must make a similar payment in immediately available funds to the receivables trustee under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and the Receivables Securitisation Agreement. The receivables trustee will pay the Trust Cash Management Fee (which is inclusive of VAT) to the trust cash manager from payments made by the beneficiaries and this amount will be deducted from the originator beneficiarys and each series portion of the finance charge collections. The receivables trustee will transfer money daily from the Trustee Collection Account in the following priority: (1) the amount of any incorrect payments notified to the receivables trustee not previously allocated as collections, to the Barclaycard Operating Account, after which the originator beneficiary will own the money absolutely; (2) the amount of ineligible collections notified to the receivables trustee not previously allocated as principal collections, to a bank account opened in the name of the originator to deposit the cash proceeds of the purchase price of the receivables, called the  Barclaycard Proceeds Account , after which the originator beneficiary will own the money absolutely; (3) the total amount of principal collections allocated to the investor interest of any outstanding series, minus the Investor Cash Available for Acquisition of that series from the Principal Collections Ledger to the account specified in the supplement for that series; (4) the total amount of Investor Cash Available for Acquisition and Originator Cash Available for Acquisition needed on that day from the ledger of the Trustee Collection Account for principal collections  called the  Principal Collections Ledger   to the Trustee Acquisition Account; (5) the Originator Percentage of finance charge collections and the amount of Acquired Interchange deposited in the Trustee Collection Account not allocated to the investor interest of any outstanding series, from the ledger of the Trustee Collection Account for finance charge collections  called the  Finance Charge Collections Ledger   to the Barclaycard Proceeds Account, or as the originator beneficiary may direct, after which the money will be owned by the originator beneficiary absolutely; and 79 Back to Contents (6) each finance charge amount and all Acquired Interchange allocable to any outstanding series, from the Finance Charge Collections Ledger to any account that may be specified in the supplement for that series. Acquiring Additional Entitlements to Trust Property and Payments for Receivables To understand what a revolving period is, see  Securitisation Cashflows: Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Principal Collections to the MTN issuing entity . During the revolving period for a series, the receivables trustee will use the portion of principal collections allocated to the investor beneficiaries of that series and which is available to fund the acquisition of the beneficial entitlement to receivables to pay for the purchase of the beneficial entitlement to receivables that are eligible. These available principal collections are called  Investor Cash Available for Acquisition . No Investor Cash Available for Acquisition will be used to fund Ineligible Receivables. On any day a series may be allocated more money for acquisitions than is needed to purchase existing or future receivables that are eligible and available for a series to fund. In that case, that series will use the excess Investor Cash Available for Acquisition to acquire available Originator Interest from the originator beneficiary and, if allowed under its supplement, investor interest from other designated series. Any money left over will be used to fund acquisitions on subsequent Business Days. The originator beneficiary will fund the amount payable by the receivables trustee for all the existing and future receivables that all series are unable to fund plus the amount of any Ineligible Receivables that need to be funded. Consequently, the amount payable by the receivables trustee to the originator for all existing and future receivables it is purchasing on any Business Day will be funded first by the series to the extent of all of the Investor Cash Available for Acquisition and then by the originator beneficiary to the extent of the Originator Cash Available for Acquisition.  Originator Cash Available for Acquisition  for any day means an amount equal to the Originator Percentage of principal collections processed on that day. On each Business Day after making all adjustments, the beneficial interest of each series in the Eligible Receivables Pool: (i) will be decreased by the amount of principal collections allocated to that series that constitutes Investor Cash Available for Acquisition; and (ii) will be increased by the amount of Investor Cash Available for Acquisition used by the receivables trustee to pay for existing and future receivables and the amount of Investor Cash Available for Acquisition allocated to the Originator Interest or the investor interest of other series to increase the proportion of the beneficial interest of that series. These changes will not affect the beneficial entitlement of: (i) any beneficiary to monies credited to any Trust Account to which it is beneficially entitled; or (ii) any series to monies credited to any Trust Account to which the beneficiaries constituting that series are together beneficially entitled. On each Business Day after making all adjustments, the beneficial interest of the originator beneficiary in the Eligible Receivables Pool: (i) will be decreased by the amount of principal collections and Investor Cash Available for Acquisition allocated to the originator beneficiary; and (ii) will be increased by the amount of Originator Cash Available for Acquisition and the increase in the Originator Interest resulting from the decrease described in the prior bullet point. However, any change in the beneficial interest of the originator beneficiary in the Eligible Receivables Pool will not affect the beneficial entitlement of the originator beneficiary to money credited to any Trust Account to which it is beneficially entitled. The investor interest of each series and the beneficial interest in the receivables trust of each additional beneficiary will increase or decrease as described in the related supplement. 80 Back to Contents On each Business Day, after making all adjustments, the Originator Interest: (i) will be decreased by the amount of Originator Cash Available for Acquisition not used to pay for new receivables and Investor Cash Available for Acquisition transferred to the originator beneficiary by credit to the Barclaycard Proceeds Account; and (ii) will be increased by the purchase price payable to the originator by the receivables trustee to be funded by the originator beneficiary. These changes will not affect the beneficial entitlement of the originator beneficiary to money credited to any Trust Account to which it is beneficially entitled. Other adjustments to the Originator Interest are explained in  The Receivables Trust: Allocation and Application of Collections . Non-Petition Undertaking of Beneficiaries Each beneficiary of the receivables trust, including Barclaycard as originator beneficiary and excess interest beneficiary, the originator, the trust cash manager and any Successor Trust Cash Manager, by entering into a supplement, will agree with the receivables trustee for itself and as trustee that it will not attempt to take any action or legal proceedings for the winding up, dissolution or reorganisation of, or for the appointment of a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar officer for, any investor beneficiary, the receivables trustee or the receivables trust. These parties will also agree not to seek to enforce any judgments against any of those persons. Trust Pay Out Events The following is a list of what we refer to in this base prospectus as the  Trust Pay Out Events : (1) the originator consents or takes any corporate action to appoint a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar officer of it or over all or substantially all of its revenues and assets; (2) proceedings are started against the originator under any applicable liquidation, insolvency, composition or reorganisation or similar laws for its winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganisation and the proceedings are not discharged within 60 days, or a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar officer of it or relating to all or substantially all of its revenues and assets is legally and validly appointed and is not discharged within 14 days; (3) a duly authorised officer of the originator admits in writing that the originator beneficiary or excess interest beneficiary is unable to pay its debts when they fall due within the meaning of Section 123(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986 or the originator makes a general assignment for the benefit of or a composition with its creditors or voluntarily suspends payment of its obligations to generally readjust or reschedule its debt; (4) the originator cannot transfer receivables in the Designated Accounts to the receivables trust in the manner described in the Receivables Securitisation Agreement; (5) the originator stops being either a resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes or liable for United Kingdom corporation tax; or (6) either: (a) a change in law or its interpretation or administration results in the receivables trustee becoming liable to make any payment on account of tax  other than stamp duty payable in the United Kingdom for the transfer of receivables under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement; or (b) any tax authority asserts a tax liability or takes other actions against Barclays or any of its subsidiaries in relation to the transaction which would have an adverse affect on them which is more than trivial, if Barclays obtains an opinion of counsel stating that the tax liability would be due. This event will be treated as 81 Back to Contents occurring when Barclays, as originator beneficiary, gives written notice of it to the receivables trustee. The Trust Pay Out Events in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) are called  Insolvency Events . If an Insolvency Event occurs, a Pay Out Event will occur for each series, each beneficiary within a series and for the originator beneficiary. If any other Trust Pay Out Event occurs, a Pay Out Event will occur for each series and each beneficiary within a series. Trust Pay Out Events will occur without any notice or other action on the part of the receivables trustee or any beneficiary, as soon as the event happens. A  Pay Out Event  for each series means a Trust Pay Out Event or one of the events listed in  Securitisation Cashflows: Series Pay Out Events . After an Insolvency Event, future receivables, other than finance charge receivables accruing for principal receivables that have been assigned to the receivables trustee, will no longer be assigned to the receivables trustee. The receivables trustee will not be entitled to accept any more offers of receivables after an Insolvency Event. Finance Charge Receivables accruing on principal receivables that have been assigned to the receivables trustee before the Insolvency Event will still be part of the receivables trusts property and finance charge collections from them will continue to be allocated and applied as set out in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and each supplement. The receivables trustee will notify each beneficiary if an Insolvency Event occurs and will dispose of the receivables on commercially reasonable terms, unless within 60 days of that notice beneficiaries representing more than 50 per cent. of the investor interest of every series, both the originator beneficiary and the excess interest beneficiary  in each case, if not subject to an Insolvency Event  and every other person identified in any supplement disapproves of the liquidation of the receivables and wishes to continue with the receivables trustee accepting offers and purchasing receivables under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement. Money from this sale will be treated as collections on the receivables and will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and each supplement. See  Securitisation Cashflows . Termination of the Receivables Trust If the receivables trust has not already been dissolved after an Insolvency Event, then the originator beneficiary can instruct the receivables trustee to dissolve the receivables trust when: (i) the total amount of all of the investor interests is reduced to zero; (ii) there are no finance charge collections or other trust property allocated to any beneficiaries other than the originator beneficiary or the excess interest beneficiary; and (iii) no beneficiary is committed to fund payments to the originator for purchases of receivables by the receivables trust. After the receivables trust is dissolved, all of the receivables trusts property will be controlled by the originator beneficiary as residual beneficiary, and the Receivables Securitisation Agreement will be terminated. For the purposes of Section 1 of the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964, the duration of the perpetuity period for the receivables trusts property will be a period ending not later than 80 years from the date of execution of the declaration of trust and cash management agreement. Any property of the receivables trust after this period will vest in the current beneficiaries in accordance with their entitlements to the receivables trusts property at that date. Amendments to the Declaration of Trust and Trust Cash Management Agreement The declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement may be amended with the prior consent of each related beneficiary. No amendment will be effective unless each rating agency has confirmed that the amendment will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of its then current rating of any outstanding Related Beneficiary Debt. No investor beneficiary will consent to any proposed amendment unless instructed to do so by Noteholders holding in total not less than two thirds of the medium term note certificates then outstanding 82 Back to Contents of each outstanding series adversely affected. The investor beneficiary may not consent to any proposed amendment that would: (i) reduce or delay required distributions to any investor beneficiary for the affected series; (ii) change the definition or the manner of calculating the investor interest, the Investor Percentage or the investor Default Amount of the affected series or any class of the affected series; or (iii) reduce the percentage required to consent to any amendment, unless instructed to do so by all the Noteholders of the medium term note certificates then outstanding of the affected series. Disposals Beneficiaries may not transfer or dispose of their beneficial entitlements in the receivables trust or create any encumbrance over its beneficial entitlement, except that: (i) the originator beneficiary or the excess interest beneficiary may dispose of the Originator Interest or the Excess Interest by transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, if that person also expressly assumes the duties and obligations of the originator, the originator beneficiary and the excess interest beneficiary under the Relevant Documents; after the transfer, the new person will be the person used to determine if an Insolvency Event has occurred; (ii) the originator beneficiary or the excess interest beneficiary may transfer or create any encumbrance over the whole or any part of the Originator Interest or the Excess Interest with the consent of investor beneficiaries representing in total more than onehalf of the total investor interest of each series; however, the rating agencies must first confirm that the transfer or encumbrance will not result in a downgrade or withdrawal of its rating of any outstanding Related Beneficiary Debt; and (iii) any beneficiary  except for the originator beneficiary or the excess interest beneficiary  may transfer all or any part of their beneficial entitlement or grant an encumbrance over their beneficial entitlement with the prior written consent of the originator beneficiary, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; however, the receivables trustee must first receive confirmation in writing from the person to whom the transfer will be made or for whom the encumbrance will be granted or created, that it complies with the criteria referred to in the fifth and sixth prerequisite to the completion of an issuance as referred to on page [75] in  General Legal Structure above. The receivables trustee will, upon the direction of all of the beneficiaries, be authorised to reassign to Barclaycard the beneficial interest in Defaulted Receivables for a purchase price equal to the amount received or recovered, if any, by Barclaycard from those Defaulted Receivables less the fees, costs and expenses incurred by Barclaycard in the recovery of that amount. Trustee Payment Amount The receivables trustee will be paid its remuneration, which is inclusive of VAT (if any), and reimbursed and indemnified (under the terms of the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement) for any costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with its duties and activities as receivables trustee, including the part of these costs and expenses that represents VAT (if any) out of the property of the receivables trust allocated to the investor beneficiaries. The receivables trustee will be paid monthly in arrears on each Transfer Date the amounts certified by the trust cash manager to the receivables trustee by the end of any monthly period as being due to it for that monthly period. This payment is called the  Trustee Payment Amount . The proportion of the Trustee Payment Amount to be paid by each series and the MTN issuing entity is described in  Securitisation Cashflows: Trustee Payment Amount . 83 Back to Contents SERVICING OF RECEIVABLES AND TRUST CASH MANAGEMENT General Servicing Barclays Bank PLC was appointed on the Initial Relevant Closing Date by the beneficiaries of the receivables trust as initial servicer under the terms of the beneficiaries servicing agreement. Any additional originator beneficiary or beneficiary must accede to the beneficiaries servicing agreement. The servicer will service, administer and manage the receivables and request and receive payments on the receivables using its usual procedures and normal market practices for servicing credit and charge card receivables comparable to the receivables in the Designated Accounts. The servicer has full power and authority, acting alone or through any other party properly designated, to undertake all actions concerning the servicing, administration and management of the receivables it considers necessary or desirable. The servicers duties include carrying out all servicing, administration and management functions in relation to the receivables and, insofar as the interests of the beneficiaries are affected, the Designated Accounts in accordance with Barclaycards policies and procedures from time to time and in accordance with normal market practice, insofar as consistent with Barclaycards policy and procedures. These functions include: (i) carrying out valuations of receivables on Designated Accounts for the purpose of determining whether any receivables should be charged off in accordance with Barclaycards credit and charge card guidelines; (ii) ensuring that the interests of the beneficiaries are taken into account in making decisions regarding the granting of credit to obligors; (iii) on its own behalf, preparing and keeping its own records as regards all of these matters, including in particular but without limitation, the matters referred to in (i) and (ii) above; (iv) monitoring payments by obligors and notifying obligors of overdue payments; and (v) crediting and debiting obligors accounts as appropriate. The servicer will at all times be required to take all practicable steps to: (i) ensure that payments made to the originator by obligors are received into the Barclaycard Operating Account; (ii) identify any funds in the Barclaycard Operating Account which are required to be transferred to the trustee collection account for the benefit of the beneficiaries; and (iii) ensure that such funds are so transferred when required. The servicer will not resign from its obligations and duties as servicer under the beneficiaries servicing agreement unless its performance is no longer permitted under applicable law and there is no reasonable action that it could take to make it permissible. The servicers resignation will not be effective until a Successor Servicer has been properly appointed. Barclaycard, as initial servicer, performs account processing and administration inhouse, but has subcontracted some cardholder payment processing services, which are undertaken on Barclaycards behalf by RRD. The servicer will indemnify each investor beneficiary against all reasonable loss, liability, expense, damage or injury caused by the servicers fraud, wilful misconduct or negligence in performing its servicing functions. However, the servicer will not indemnify any investor beneficiary: (i) if any acts or omissions are caused by the negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of that investor beneficiary or its agents; (ii) for any liabilities, costs or expenses of the receivables trust for any action taken by the receivables trustee at the request of any investor beneficiary of any series to which that investor beneficiary belongs; (iii) for any loss, claims or damages that are incurred by any of them acting in their capacity as beneficiaries, including those resulting from Defaulted Accounts; or 84 Back to Contents (iv) for any liabilities, costs or expenses arising under any tax law, or any penalties or interest caused by a failure to comply with any tax law, payable by it in connection with the beneficiaries servicing agreement to any tax authority.

Any person into which the servicer may be merged or consolidated, or any person succeeding to or acquiring the business of the servicer in whole or in part, after executing a supplemental agreement to the beneficiaries servicing agreement and the delivery of a legal opinion, will become the successor to the servicer or coservicer with the servicer under the beneficiaries servicing agreement. General  Trust Cash Management Barclaycard was appointed on the Initial Relevant Closing Date by the receivables trustee as initial trust cash manager under the terms of the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement. The trust cash manager will carry out cash management functions in relation to the receivables on behalf of the receivables trustee. The trust cash managers duties include but are not confined to: (i) making calculations on the allocations of receivables; and (ii) advising the receivables trustee to transfer money between the Trust Accounts and to make withdrawals and payments from the Trust Accounts as set forth in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement. The trust cash manager will not resign from its obligations and duties as trust cash manager under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement unless its performance is no longer permitted under applicable law and there is no reasonable action that it can take to remedy the situation. The trust cash managers resignation will not be effective until a Successor Trust Cash Manager has been properly appointed. The trust cash manager will indemnify the receivables trustee and the receivables trust against all reasonable loss, liability, expense, damage or injury, in each case including VAT, if any, caused by its fraud, wilful misconduct or negligence in performing its cash management functions. However, the trust cash manager will not indemnify the receivables trustee: (i) if any acts or omissions are caused by the negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of the receivables trustee or its agents; (ii) for any liabilities, costs or other expenses of the receivables trust for any action taken by the receivables trustee at the request of any investor beneficiary of any series to which that investor beneficiary belongs; (iii) for any losses, claims or damages incurred by the receivables trustee in its capacity as a beneficiary of the receivables trust; or (iv) for any liabilities or other costs of it or the receivables trust arising under any tax law or any penalties or interest caused by a failure to comply with any tax law, payable by it or the receivables trust in connection with the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement to any tax authority. The directors, officers and other employees and agents of the trust cash manager and the trust cash manager itself will not be under any liability to the receivables trustee or the receivables trust or any other person under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement except in the case of intentional wrongdoing, bad faith or negligence in performing its duties under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement. 85 Back to Contents Any person into which the trust cash manager may be merged or consolidated, or any person succeeding to or acquiring the business of the trust cash manager in whole or in part, after executing a supplemental agreement to the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and the delivery of a legal opinion, will become the successor to the trust cash manager or cotrust cash manager under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement. Servicer and Trust Cash Manager Compensation The servicer is entitled to receive an annual fee from the beneficiaries for each monthly period. This fee is called the  Servicing Fee  and is payable monthly on each Transfer Date, to the extent that those monies are available. Any amounts payable in respect of the Servicing Fee will be inclusive of VAT, if any. The Servicing Fee will be equal to one-twelfth of the product of: (i) the weighted average of the percentages specified in each series supplement as being the  Series Servicing Fee Percentage  for each outstanding series  weighted by the Adjusted Investor Interest for each series as at the last day of the relevant monthly period; and (ii) the average daily total outstanding face amount of principal receivables during that monthly period. The share of the Servicing Fee payable by the receivables trustee to the servicer for each series on any Transfer Date is called the  Investor Servicing Fee  and will be equal to: (i) one-twelfth of the product of: (1) [0.75] per cent.; or (2) another percentage agreed with the investor beneficiaries as long as Barclaycard is the servicer provided that the rating agencies confirm in writing that the new percentage will not cause them to reduce or withdraw their then current rating on any Related Beneficiary Debt; and (ii) the Adjusted Investor Interest as at the last day of the monthly period before that Transfer Date. The balance of the Servicing Fee not payable in respect of each series or any other series will be payable by the originator and is called the  Originator Servicing Fee . If the servicer is also the originator beneficiary in any monthly period, the Originator Servicing Fee for that monthly period will not be payable. The trust cash manager is entitled to receive a VAT inclusive fee from the receivables trustee for each monthly period. This fee is called the  Trust Cash Management Fee  and is payable monthly on each Transfer Date. The Trust Cash Management Fee will be equal to one-twelfth of the product of the sum of the annual fees in each supplement as being the Investor Trust Cash Management Fees for each series. The share of the Trust Cash Management Fee payable by the receivables trustee to the trust cash manager for each series on any Transfer Date for which each series agrees to indemnify the receivables trustee is called the  Investor Trust Cash Management Fee  and will be equal to one-twelfth of £[]. The Trust Cash Management Fee can be any other amount that the receivables trustee may agree to as long as Barclaycard is the trust cash manager provided that the rating agencies confirm in writing that the new amount will not cause them to reduce or withdraw their then current rating on any Related Beneficiary Debt. The balance of the Trust Cash Management Fee, in respect of which the receivables trustee is not indemnified by any series, will be payable by the originator and is called the  Originator Trust Cash Management Fee . If the trust cash manager is also the originator beneficiary in any monthly period, the Originator Trust Cash Management Fee for that monthly period will not be paid. Evidence as to Compliance The fiscal year for the issuing entity will end on 31 December of each year. If required by the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder in respect of any Series of notes offered and sold in the United States pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities 86 Back to Contents Act, the servicer will file with the SEC an annual report on Form 10-K on behalf of the issuing entity, 90 days after the end of its fiscal year. If required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder in respect of any series of notes offered and sold in the United States pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, the servicer will deliver to the Receivables Trustee, the originator, the rating agencies and each beneficiary, as applicable, and file with the SEC as part of an annual report on Form 10-K filed on behalf of the issuing entity the following documents: (i) a report regarding its assessment of compliance during the preceding fiscal year with all applicable servicing criteria set forth in relevant SEC regulations with respect to asset-backed securities transactions taken as a whole involving the servicer that are backed by the same types of assets as those backing the notes; (ii) with respect to each assessment report described immediately above, a report by a registered public accounting firm that attests to, and reports on, the assessment made by the asserting party, as set forth in relevant SEC regulations; and (iii) a servicer compliance certificate, signed by an authorised officer of the servicer, to the effect that: (i) a review of the servicers activities during the reporting period and of its performance under the beneficiary servicing agreement has been made under such officers supervision; and (ii) to the best of such officers knowledge, based on such review, the servicer has fulfilled all of its obligations under the beneficiaries servicing agreement in all material respects throughout the reporting period or, if there has been a failure known to such officer, the nature and status thereof. The servicers obligation to deliver any servicing assessment report or attestation report and, if required, to file the same with the SEC, is limited to those reports prepared by the servicer and, in the case of reports prepared by any other party, those reports actually received by the servicer. Copies of all statements, certificates and reports may be obtained by any Noteholder by a request in writing to the Receivables Trustee addressed to the director. Except as described above or as described in this base prospectus or the related prospectus supplement there will not be any independent verification that any duty or obligation to be performed by any transaction party  including the servicer  has been performed by that party. Termination of Appointment of Servicer The appointment of an originator as servicer under the beneficiaries servicing agreement and the appointment of any person as joint servicer to replace anyone then acting as the servicer  called a  Successor Servicer   will terminate when a servicer default occurs and is continuing.  Servicer Default  means any one of the following events: (1) failure on the part of the servicer duly to observe or perform in any respect any other covenant or agreement of the servicer contained in the beneficiaries servicing agreement, or any other relevant document, that has a material adverse effect on the interests of the investor beneficiaries of any outstanding series; this failure will constitute a servicer default only if it remains unremedied and continues to have an adverse effect on the interests of the investor beneficiaries for 60 days after the receipt of a notice of the failure is given by the investor beneficiaries to the servicer; if the notice is given by the investor beneficiaries it will be on the instruction of a group of holders of medium term note certificates representing more than fifty per cent. of the total face value of the medium term note certificates outstanding of any outstanding series adversely affected; (2) delegation by the servicer of its duties under the beneficiaries servicing agreement to any other entity, except as permitted by the beneficiaries servicing agreement; (3) any relevant representation, warranty or certification made by the servicer in the beneficiaries servicing agreement or in any certificate delivered under the beneficiaries servicing agreement was incorrect when made, which has a material adverse effect on the interests of the investor beneficiaries of any outstanding series; this failure will only be a servicer default if it remains unremedied and continues to have an adverse effect on 87 Back to Contents the interests of the investor beneficiaries for 60 days after the receipt of a notice of the failure is given; the notice of the failure will be given by either (1) the receivables trustee to the servicer, or (2) the investor beneficiaries to the receivables trustee and the servicer; if the notice is given by the investor beneficiaries it will be on the instruction of holders of the medium term note certificate representing more than fifty per cent. of the total face value of the medium term note certificate outstanding of any outstanding series adversely affected; (4) any of the following: (a) the servicer agrees to or takes any corporate action to appoint a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee or similar officer of it or of all of its revenues and assets; or (b) an order of the court is made for its windingup, dissolution, administration or reorganisation that has remained in force undischarged or unstayed for 60 days; or (c) a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee or similar officer of it or all of its revenues and assets, is appointed; and (5) any of the following: (a) a duly authorised officer of the servicer admits in writing that the servicer is unable to pay its debts as they fall due within the meaning of Section 123(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986; or (b) the servicer makes a general assignment for the benefit of or a composition with its creditors or it voluntarily suspends payment of its obligations with a view to the general readjustment or rescheduling of its indebtedness. In the case of (1), (2) or (3) above the grace period will be 60 Business Days. The grace period is the extra number of days before a servicer default can be called, allowing the servicer to remedy a servicer default that has been caused by socalled acts of God or uncontrollable circumstances. These circumstances are called force majeure events and are listed in the beneficiaries servicing agreement. Within two Business Days after the servicer becomes aware of any servicer default, the servicer must notify the beneficiaries, each rating agency, the security trustee and any enhancement provider as soon as possible in writing. The beneficiaries must give each rating agency notice of any removal of the servicer or appointment of a Successor Servicer. Investor beneficiaries acting on the instructions of holders of medium term note certificates representing in total more than twothirds of the total face value of medium term note certificates then outstanding of each series adversely affected by any default by the servicer or the originator in the performance of its obligations under the beneficiaries servicing agreement and any other Relevant Documents, may waive the default unless it is a failure to make any required deposits, or payments of interest or principal for the adversely affected series. After the servicer receives a termination notice and a Successor Servicer is appointed, the duties of acting as servicer of the receivables under the beneficiaries servicing agreement will pass from the then servicer to the Successor Servicer. The beneficiaries servicing agreement contains the requirements for the transfer of the servicing role, including the transfer of authority over collections, the transfer of electronic records and the disclosure of information. After it receives a termination notice, the servicer will continue to act as servicer until agreed by it and the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries must try to appoint a Successor Servicer that is an Eligible Servicer. If the receivables trustee cannot appoint a Successor Servicer and the servicer delivers a certificate that says it cannot in good faith cure the servicer default, then the receivables trustee will start the process of selling the receivables. The beneficiaries will notify any enhancement providers of the proposed sale of the receivables by the receivables trustee to a third party and will provide each enhancement provider an opportunity to bid on purchasing the receivables. 88 Back to Contents The proceeds of the sale will be deposited in the Trust Accounts for distribution to the beneficiaries as set out in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and the series supplements. An  Eligible Servicer  means an entity that, when it is servicer: (i) is servicing a portfolio of consumer revolving credit or charge card accounts or other consumer credit accounts; (ii) is legally qualified and has the capacity to service the Designated Accounts; (iii) is qualified or licensed to use the software that the servicer is then currently using to service the Designated Accounts or obtains the right to use, or has its own, software that is adequate to perform its duties under the beneficiaries servicing agreement; and (iv) has, in the opinion of each rating agency, demonstrated the ability to service, professionally and competently, a portfolio of similar accounts in accordance with customary standards of skill and care. Termination of Appointment of Trust Cash Manager The appointment of the originator as trust cash manager under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and the appointment of any person as joint trust cash manager or to replace anyone then acting as the trust cash manager  called a  Successor Trust Cash Manager   will terminate when a trust cash manager default occurs.  Trust Cash Manager Default  means any one of the following events: (1) any failure by the trust cash manager to direct the making of any payment, transfer or deposit or to give instructions or notice to the receivables trustee pursuant to an agreed schedule of collections and allocations; any failure by the trust cash manager to advise the receivables trustee to make any required drawing, withdrawal, or payment under any credit enhancement; these events will be considered failures if they do not happen within five Business Days after the date that they were supposed to happen under the terms of the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement or any other relevant document; (2) failure on the part of the trust cash manager duly to observe or perform in any respect any other covenant or agreement of the trust cash manager contained in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement, or any other relevant document, that has a material adverse effect on the interests of the investor beneficiaries of any outstanding series; this failure will constitute a servicer default only if it remains unremedied and continues to have a material adverse effect on the interests of the investor beneficiaries for 60 days after the receipt of a notice of the failure is given; the notice of the failure will be given by either (1) the receivables trustee to the trust cash manager, or (2) the investor beneficiaries to the receivables trustee and the trust cash manager; if the notice is given by the investor beneficiaries it will be on the instruction of a group of holders of medium term note certificates representing more than fifty per cent. of the total face value of th e medium term note certificates outstanding of any outstanding series adversely affected; (3) delegation by the trust cash manager of its duties under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement to any other entity, except as permitted by the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement; (4) any relevant representation, warranty or certification made by the trust cash manager in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement or in any certificate delivered under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement was incorrect when made, which has a material adverse effect on the interests of the investor beneficiaries of any outstanding series; this failure will be a trust cash manager default only if it remains unremedied and continues to have a material adverse effect on the interests of the investor beneficiaries for 60 days after the receipt of a notice of the failure is given; the notice of the failure will be given by either (1) the receivables trustee 89 Back to Contents to the trust cash manager, or (2) the investor beneficiaries to the receivables trustee and the trust cash manager; if the notice is given by the investor beneficiaries it will be on the instruction of holders of medium term note certificates representing more than fifty per cent. of the total face value of the medium term note certificates outstanding of any outstanding series adversely affected; (5) any of the following: (a) the trust cash manager agrees to or takes any corporate action to appoint a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar officer of it or of all of its revenues and assets; or (b) an order of the court is made for its windingup, dissolution, administration or reorganisation that has remained in force undischarged or unstayed for 60 days; or (c) a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar officer of it or all of its revenues and assets is appointed; and (6) any of the following: (a) a duly authorised officer of the trust cash manager admits in writing that the trust cash manager is unable to pay its debts as they fall due within the meaning of Section 123(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986; or (b) the trust cash manager makes a general assignment for the benefit of or a composition with its creditors or it voluntarily suspends payment of its obligations with a view to the general readjustment or rescheduling of its indebtedness. In the case of (1) above the grace period will be 10 Business Days and in the case of (2), (3) or (4) above it will be 60 Business Days. The grace period is the extra number of days before a trust cash manager default will be effective allowing the trust cash manager to remedy a trust cash manager default that has been caused by socalled acts of God or uncontrollable circumstances. These circumstances are called force majeure events and are listed in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement. Within two Business Days after the trust cash manager becomes aware of any trust cash manager default, the trust cash manager must notify the receivables trustee, each rating agency, each investor beneficiary and any enhancement provider as soon as possible in writing. The receivables trustee must give each investor beneficiary and rating agency notice of any removal of the trust cash manager or appointment of a Successor Trust Cash Manager. The receivables trustee must give each rating agency notice of any removal of the trust cash manager. Investor beneficiaries acting on the instructions of holders of medium term note certificates representing in total more than twothirds of the total face value of medium term note certificates then outstanding of each series adversely affected by any default by the trust cash manager or the originator in the performance of its obligations under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and any other Relevant Documents, may waive the default unless it is a failure to make any required deposits, or payments of interest or principal, for the adversely affected series. After the trust cash manager receives a termination notice and a Successor Trust Cash Manager is appointed, the duties of acting as trust cash manager of the receivables under the declaration trust and trust cash management agreement will pass from the then trust cash manager to the Successor Trust Cash Manager. The declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement contains the requirements for the transfer of the trust cash management role, including the transfer of authority over collections, the transfer of electronic records and the disclosure of information. After it receives a termination notice, the trust cash manager will continue to act as trust cash manager until a date agreed by the receivables trustee and the trust cash manager. The receivables trustee must try to appoint a Successor Trust Cash Manager that is an Eligible Trust Cash Manager. 90 Back to Contents If the receivables trustee cannot appoint a Successor Trust Cash Manager and the trust cash manager delivers a certificate that says it cannot in good faith cure the trust cash manager default, then the receivables trustee will start the process of selling the receivables. The receivables trustee will notify each enhancement provider of the proposed sale of the receivables by the receivables trustee to a third party and will provide each enhancement provider an opportunity to bid on purchasing the receivables. The proceeds of the sale will be deposited in the Trust Accounts for distribution to the beneficiaries as set out in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement and the series supplements. An  Eligible Trust Cash Manager  means an entity that, when it is trust cash manager: (i) is legally qualified and has the capacity to carry out the trust cash management functions as set forth in the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement; (ii) is qualified or licensed to use the software that the trust cash manager is then currently using to carry out cash management of the receivables or obtains the right to use, or has its own, software that is adequate to perform its duties under the declaration of trust and trust cash management agreement; and (iii) has, in the opinion of each rating agency, demonstrated the ability to professionally and competently act as a trust cash manager in accordance with customary standards of skill and care. 91 Back to Contents SECURITISATION CASHFLOWS General The MTN issuing entity is an investor beneficiary of the receivables trust. Its initial beneficial interest was conferred under a series supplement called the series 991 supplement (series 991 was fully repaid in November 2002) and subsequent beneficial interests were conferred under series supplements called the series 021 (series 02-1 was fully repaid in October 2007), series 031 (series 03-1 was fully repaid in March 2008), series 032 (series 03-2 was fully repaid in June 2006), series 033 (series 03-3 was fully repaid in August 2006), series 041 (series 04-1 was fully repaid in February 2007), series 042 (series 04-2 was fully repaid in November 2007), series 051, series 052, series 053, series 05-4 and series 06-1 supplements. The MTN issuing entity will increase its entitlement under the receivables trust under series supplements. The parties to each series supplement are the receivables trustee and Barclaycard as the originator beneficiary, the Excess Inte rest Beneficiary, the servicer, the trust cash manager, the originator and the MTN issuing entity as the investor beneficiary. The MTN issuing entity will increase its beneficial entitlement as investor beneficiary by paying a sterling amount specified in each series prospectus supplement/final terms to the receivables trustee on each series closing date; we call this amount the  Initial Investor Interest . For purposes of making calculations about the performance of the undivided beneficial interest of each series in the receivables trust, the investor interest will be referable to notional classes called  Class A ,  Class B ,  Class C  and  Class D  (if applicable). The MTN issuing entity will receive an Investor Certificate in respect of each series. This Investor Certificate will be evidence of the initial investor beneficial interest for each series in the receivables trust, calculated as referable to Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D, and will be governed by English law. The MTN issuing entity will confirm the following in each series supplement: (i) that its usual place of abode is within the United Kingdom for the purposes of section 874(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007; and (ii) that it has a business establishment, for the purposes of Section 9 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, in the United Kingdom which is either its sole business establishment, with no other fixed establishment anywhere else in the world, or is its business or other fixed establishment at which any services received by it as contemplated in the Relevant Documents are most directly used or to be used or, as the case may be, its business or other fixed establishment which is most directly concerned with any services supplied by it as contemplated in the Relevant Documents. Group one included series 991 (now repaid) and includes series 021 (now repaid), series 031 (now repaid), series 032 (now repaid), series 033 (now repaid), series 041 (now repaid), series 042, series 051, series 052, series 053, series 05-04 and series 06-1. Each series in group one will not be subordinated to any other investor beneficiary or series. See   Shared Principal Collections  for the ramifications of a series being included in group one. Following execution of the series supplement the MTN issuing entity will acquire from Barclays Bank PLC as Excess Interest Beneficiary that part of the rights of Barclays Bank PLC to the Excess Interest attributable to the relevant series.

(21) on any Distribution Date, an amount equal to the principal calculated as payable in accordance with the Expenses Loan Agreement, if any, will be paid into the Series Distribution Account; and (22) the balance, if any, after giving effect to the payments made under paragraphs (1) through (21) above will be paid to the MTN issuing entity as assignee of the excess interest beneficiary and will then cease to be property of the receivables trust. On each Distribution Date, all amounts credited to the Series Distribution Ledger for the amounts in (2), (3) and (4) above will be deposited in the Series Distribution Account. The aggregate of amounts in (2), (3) and (4) above are called the  Class A Monthly Distribution Amount . Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Principal Collections to the MTN Issuing Entity The amount of principal collections transferred on a daily basis (see  The Receivables TrustAllocation and Application of Collections ) during any monthly period to the Principal Collections Ledger of the Trustee Collection Account will only be transferred and distributed to the MTN issuing entity as investor beneficiary (to the extent of its beneficial interest) after making the calculations described below. These calculations and the amounts actually transferred differ depending upon whether a particular series is in the Revolving Period, the Controlled Accumulation Period, the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period. Allocation of Principal Collections to the Investor Interest During the Revolving Period, principal collections will be allocated to the investor interest on the basis of the Floating Investor Percentage. During the Controlled Accumulation Period, the Regulated Amortisation Period and the Rapid Amortisation Period, principal collections will be allocated to the investor interest on the basis of the Fixed Investor Percentage. The amount of principal collections 106 Back to Contents allocated to the investor interest and available to the MTN issuing entity at any time will be credited to the Principal Collections Ledger for the relevant series. The principal collections credited to the Principal Collections Ledger from time to time that will be allocated to the MTN issuing entity will be determined in accordance with the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms.  Fixed Investor Percentage  means, for any monthly period, the following calculation expressed as a percentage: A ______________________ the greater of B or C Where: A = the investor interest calculated at close of business on the last day of the Revolving Period; B = the total balance of eligible principal receivables in the receivables trust plus the Unavailable Principal Collections standing to the credit of the Principal Collections Ledger; and C = the sum of the numerators used to calculate the fixed investor percentages for all outstanding series. Items B and C above will be calculated for any monthly period as of the last day of the prior monthly period. For the first monthly period, they will be calculated as of the relevant closing date. The Fixed Investor Percentage will never exceed 100 per cent. Notwithstanding the above, for a monthly period in which an Addition Date occurs, B in the fraction used to calculate the Fixed Investor Percentage above will be: (i) for the period from the first day of the monthly period to the Addition Date, the total balance of eligible principal receivables in the receivables trust plus the Unavailable Principal Collections standing to the credit of the Principal Collections Ledger at the close of business on the last day of the prior monthly period; and (ii) for the period from the Addition Date to the last day of the monthly period, the total balance of eligible principal receivables in the receivables trust plus the Unavailable Principal Collections standing to the credit of the Principal Collections Ledger on the Addition Date, taking into account the eligible principal receivables added to the receivables trust. If in any monthly period the investor interest would be zero if the payments to be made on the Distribution Date during that monthly period were made on the last day of the prior monthly period, the Fixed Investor Percentage will be zero. Revolving Period The  Revolving Period  for each series is the period from the relevant closing date to the start of the Controlled Accumulation Period or, if earlier, the start of the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, the triggers for which are described in  Securitisation Cashflows . During the Revolving Period, principal collections calculated as referable daily to the Class A Investor Interest will be used by the receivables trustee as Shared Principal Collections and, to the extent not used as Shared Principal Collections, to make payments to the originator: (i) to accept new offers of Eligible Receivables made by the originator to the receivables trustee, and (ii) to make payments to the originator for future receivables assigned by the originator to the receivables trustee by offers that have already been made and accepted. Principal collections calculated as referable to the Class B Investor Interest, the Class C Investor Interest and the Class D Investor Interest will be used by the receivables trustee as described in the previous paragraph on the next following Transfer Date to the extent (i) not required to fund shortfalls for the Class A Investor Interest and  for principal collections calculated as referable to the Class C Investor Interest  the Class B Investor Interest and  for principal collections calculated as referable to the Class D Investor Interest  the Class B Investor Interest and the Class C Investor Interest and (ii) not required 107 Back to Contents to be used by the Receivables Trustee as Shared Principal Collections (see  Shared Principal Collections  below). For a further description, please see  The Receivables . As noted above, a specified percentage of principal collections calculated by reference to the notes of each series which are not the most senior class, specified as the Required Retained Principal Percentage of such principal collections will be retained within the Trustee Collection Account of the Receivables Trust and may be used to meet certain payments or distributions to the MTN issuing entity on a Transfer Date in respect of each relevant series which it is not able to satisfy from finance charge collections distributed as described above under  Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Finance Charge Collections to the MTN Issuing Entity . Any Required Retained Investor Allocation not utilised shall be available to meet any Controlled Deposit Amount, Shared Principal Collections and any such amounts remaining may flow to the originator. For calculation purposes, to the extent amounts of Required Retained Investor Allocation are distributed to the MTN issuing entity to help it make certain of its payments or distributions, these amounts are defined as  Utilised Required Retained Investor Allocation . For calculation purposes, Utilised Required Retained Investor Allocation are divided into amounts utilised as Reallocated Class D Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections or (as the case may be) as Reallocated Class B Principal Collections. See  Defaulted Receivables; Investor Charge-offs  below for further information on Reallocated Class B Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections and Reallocated Class D Principal Collections. Controlled Accumulation Period The  Controlled Accumulation Period  for each series is the period scheduled to begin on the date specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms and ending when the investor interest is paid in full, unless a Pay Out Event occurs and the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period begins. If the Regulated Amortisation Period or Rapid Amortisation Period begins before the start of the Controlled Accumulation Period, there will not be a Controlled Accumulation Period for the relevant series. The start of the Controlled Accumulation Period may be delayed until no later than the close of business on the date specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. See   Postponement of Controlled Accumulation Period . During the Controlled Accumulation Period the principal collections allocated to the investor interest for the relevant series less any Required Retained Investor Allocation, up to the Controlled Deposit Amount, will be accumulated by the receivables trustee in a trust account called the  Principal Funding Account  for distribution to the MTN issuing entity as the investor beneficiary for the relevant series on the Distribution Date  called the  Series Scheduled Redemption Date . Any principal collections allocated to the investor interest for the relevant series over the amount that will be deposited in the Principal Funding Account will be used by the receivables trustee first as Shared Principal Collections and then to make payments to the originator as described above under   Revolving Period . As in the Revolving Period, during each monthly period during the Controlled Accumulation Period, a specified percentage of Principal Collections as calculated by reference to each series equal to the Required Retained Principal Percentage of such Principal Collections will be retained within the Trustee Collection Account of the receivables trustee and may be used on a Transfer Date to make certain payments or distributions to the MTN issuing entity in respect of the relevant series which it is not able to satisfy from finance charge collections distributed as described under  Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Finance Charge Collections to the MTN Issuing Entity . For calculation purposes, these amounts of Utilised Required Retained Investor Allocation are divided into amounts utilised as Reallocated Class D Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections or (as the case may be) Reallocated Class B Principal Collections. See  Defaulted Receivables; Investor Charge-offs below for further information on Reallocated Class D Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections and Reallocated Class B Principal Collections. The  Controlled Deposit Amount  for any Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period will be the sterling equivalent of the amount specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, using, if applicable, the fixed exchange rate in the Swap Agreements, which equals the Initial Investor Interest divided by 12, or for a Regulated Amortisation Period, if greater, may be an amount not exceeding 1/12 of the total sum of all investor interests of all 108 Back to Contents series in group one  except Companion Series  that are scheduled to be in their revolving periods. If the start of the Controlled Accumulation Period is delayed as described in   Postponement of Controlled Accumulation Period , the Controlled Deposit Amount will be greater than the sterling equivalent of the amount specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. This higher amount will be determined by the servicer based on the principal payment rates on the Designated Accounts and on the investor interests of series in group one  except Companion Series  that are scheduled to be in their revolving periods. In any case, during the Controlled Accumulation Period, the Controlled Deposit Amount will be the amount that, if deposited in the Principal Funding Account on each Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period, will cause the balance of the Principal Funding Account to equal the investor interest on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date. The Controlled Deposit Amount for any Transfer Date will include the amount of any shortfall in payment of the Controlled Deposit Amount for the previous Transfer Date. Regulated Amortisation Period A  Regulated Amortisation Period  will start on the day, if there is one, that any of the following Series Pay Out Events occur, each of which we refer to as a  Regulated Amortisation Trigger Event : (i) the average Portfolio Yield for any three consecutive monthly periods is less than the average Expense Rate for those periods or, on any Determination Date before the end of the third monthly period from the relevant closing date, the Portfolio Yield is less than average Expense Rate for that period; or (ii) either: (1) over any period of thirty consecutive days, the Originator Interest averaged over that period is less than the Minimum Originator Interest for that period and the Originator Interest does not increase on or before the tenth Business Day following that thirty day period to an amount so that the average of the Originator Interest as a percentage of the Average Principal Receivables for such thirty day period, computed by assuming that the amount of the increase of the Originator Interest by the last day of that ten Business Day period, as compared to the Originator Interest on the last day of the thirty day period, would have existed in the receivables trust during each day of the thirty day period, is at least equal to the Minimum Originator Interest; or (2) on the last day of any monthly period the total balance of eligible principal receivables is less than the Minimum Aggregate Principal Receivables, adjusted for any series having a Companion Series as described in the supplement for that series and the Companion Series, and the total balance of eligible principal receivables fails to increase to an amount equal to or greater than the Minimum Aggregate Principal Receivables on or before the tenth Business Day following that last day. The Regulated Amortisation Period will continue until the earlier of: (i) the start of the Rapid Amortisation Period; and (ii) the Series Termination Date. During the Regulated Amortisation Period the amount of principal collections allocated to the investor interest for the relevant series less any Required Retained Investor Allocation, up to the Controlled Deposit Amount, will be paid each month to the MTN issuing entity first for the Class A Investor Interest, second for the Class B Investor Interest, third for the Class C Investor Interest and fourth for the Class D Investor Interest until the Series Termination Date. Any principal collections allocated to the investor interest for the series over the Controlled Deposit Amount paid to the MTN issuing entity will be used by the receivables trustee first as Shared Principal Collections and then to make payments to the originator as described above under   Revolving Period . As in the Revolving Period and the Controlled Accumulation Period, during each monthly period during the Regulated Amortisation Period, a specified percentage of Principal Collections as calculated by reference to the relevant series equal to the Required Retained Principal Percentage of such Principal Collections will be retained within the Trustee Collection Account of the receivables trust and may be used on a Transfer Date to make certain payments or distributions to the MTN issuing entity in respect of 109 Back to Contents the relevant series which it is not able to satisfy from finance charge collections distributed as described under  Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Finance Charge Collections to the MTN Issuing Entity . For calculation purposes, these amounts of Utilised Required Retained Investor Allocation are divided into amounts utilised as Reallocated Class D Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections or (as the case may be) Reallocated Class B Principal Collections. See  Defaulted Receivables; Investor Charge-offs  below for further information on Reallocated Class D Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections and Reallocated Class B Principal Collections. Rapid Amortisation Period A  Rapid Amortisation Period  will start on the first day of the monthly period next following the day on which any Pay Out Event other than a Regulated Amortisation Trigger Event occurs. The Rapid Amortisation Period will continue until the earlier of: (i) the Series Termination Date; or (ii) the dissolution of the receivables trust following the occurrence of an Insolvency Event; see  The Receivables Trust: Trust Pay Out Events . During the Rapid Amortisation Period, principal collections allocable to the investor interest of the relevant series will be paid each month to the MTN issuing entity first for the Class A Investor Interest, second for the Class B Investor Interest, third for the Class C Investor Interest and fourth for the Class D Investor Interest until the Series Termination Date. As in the Revolving Period, the Controlled Accumulation Period and the Regulated Amortisation Period, during each monthly period during the Regulated Amortisation Period, a specified percentage of Principal Collections as calculated by reference to the relevant series equal to the Required Retained Principal Percentage of such Principal Collections will be retained within the Trustee Collection Account of the receivables trust and may be used on a Transfer Date to make certain payments or distributions to the MTN issuing entity in respect of the relevant series which it is not able to satisfy from finance charge collections distributed as described under  Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Finance Charge Collections to the MTN Issuing Entity . For calculation purposes, these amounts of Utilised Required Retained Investor Allocation are divided into amounts utilised as Reallocated Class D Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections or (as the case may be) Reallocated Class B Principal Collections. See  Defaulted Receivables; Investor Charge-offs  below for further information on Reallocated Class D Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections and Reallocated Class B Principal Collections. Distribution of Reinvested Investor Principal Collections On each Business Day during the Revolving Period which is not a Transfer Date, the Reinvested Investor Principal Collections for that day will be distributed in the following priority: (i) the Reinvested Investor Principal Collections will be applied as Shared Principal Collections and allocated to other outstanding series in group one; see   Shared Principal Collections ; and (ii) the balance remaining will be applied as Investor Cash Available for Acquisition in the manner described in  The Receivables Trust: Acquiring Additional Entitlements to Trust Property and Payments for Receivables . On each Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period, the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, the receivables trustee will withdraw the Class A Monthly Principal Amount from the Principal Collections Ledger and: (i) for a Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period, deposit it into the Principal Funding Account; or (ii) for a Transfer Date during the Rapid Amortisation Period or Regulated Amortisation Period, credit it to the Series Distribution Ledger. The first Distribution Date (1) for the Controlled Accumulation Period, on which an amount equal to the Class A Investor Interest has been deposited in the Principal Funding Account, or (2) during 110 Back to Contents the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, on which the Class A Investor Interest is paid in full, is called the  Class B Principal Commencement Date . Starting with the Class B Principal Commencement Date, to the extent there are funds remaining after distributing the Class A Monthly Principal Amount, the receivables trustee will withdraw the Class B Monthly Principal Amount from the Principal Collections Ledger and: (i) for a Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period, deposit it into the Principal Funding Account; or (ii) for a Transfer Date during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, credit it to the Series Distribution Ledger. The first Distribution Date (1) for the Controlled Accumulation Period, on which an amount equal to the sum of the Class A Investor Interest and the Class B Investor Interest has been deposited in the Principal Funding Account, or (2) during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, on which the Class B Investor Interest is paid in full, is called the  Class C Principal Commencement Date . Starting with the Class C Principal Commencement Date, to the extent there are funds remaining after distributing the Class A Monthly Principal Amount and the Class B Monthly Principal Amount, as applicable, the receivables trustee will withdraw the Class C Monthly Principal Amount from the Principal Collections Ledger and: (i) for a Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period, deposit it into the Principal Funding Account; or (ii) for a Transfer Date during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, credit it to the Series Distribution Ledger. The first Distribution Date (1) for the Controlled Accumulation Period, on which an amount equal to the sum of the Class A Investor Interest, the Class B Investor Interest and the Class C Investor Interest has been deposited in the Principal Funding Account, or (2) during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, on which the Class C Investor Interest is paid in full, is called the  Class D Principal Commencement Date . Starting with the Class D Principal Commencement Date, to the extent there are funds remaining after distributing the Class A Monthly Principal Amount, the Class B Monthly Principal Amount and the Class C Monthly Principal Amount, as applicable, the receivables trustee will withdraw the Class D Monthly Principal Amount from the Principal Collections Ledger and: (i) for a Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period, deposit it into the Principal Funding Account; or (ii) for a Transfer Date during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, credit it to the Series Distribution Ledger. Distribution of Principal Collections On the earlier of (1) the first Distribution Date during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period and (2) the Series Scheduled Redemption Date, and on each Distribution Date after that, the receivables trustee will distribute the following amounts in the following priority: (1) from the Principal Funding Account, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account; and (b) the Class A Investor Interest; will be deposited in the Series Distribution Account for Class A and will be owned by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will use this amount to repay principal outstanding on the medium term note certificate; 111 Back to Contents (2) from the Series Distribution Ledger an amount equal to the lesser of : (a) the amount credited to the Series Distribution Ledger; and (b) the Class A Investor Interest, after taking into account the amounts described in clause (1) above; will be deposited to the Series Distribution Account for Class A and will be owned by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will use this amount to repay principal outstanding on the medium term note certificate. Starting on the earlier of (1) if the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account exceeds the Class A Investor Interest, the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and (2) during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, the Class B Principal Commencement Date, and on each Distribution Date after that, the receivables trustee will distribute the following amounts in the following priority: (1) from the Principal Funding Account, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account in excess of the Class A Investor Interest; and (b) the Class B Investor Interest: will be deposited to the Series Distribution Account for Class B and will be owned by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will use this amount to repay principal outstanding on the medium term note certificate; (2) from the Series Distribution Ledger an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount credited to the Series Distribution Ledger; and (b) the Class B Investor Interest, after taking into account the amount described in clause (1) above; this amount will be deposited in the Series Distribution Account for Class B and will be owned by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will use this amount to repay principal outstanding on the medium term note certificate. Starting on the earlier of (1) if the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account exceeds the sum of the Class A Investor Interest and the Class B Investor Interest, the Series Scheduled Redemption Date, and (2) during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, the Class C Principal Commencement Date, and on each Distribution Date after that, the receivables trustee will distribute the following amounts in the following priority: (1) from the Principal Funding Account, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account in excess of the sum of the Class A Investor Interest and the Class B Investor Interest; and (b) the Class C Investor Interest; will be deposited in the Series Distribution Account for Class C and will be owned by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will use this amount to repay principal outstanding on the medium term note certificate. (2) from the Series Distribution Ledger, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount credited to the Series Distribution Ledger; and (b) the Class C Investor Interest after taking into account the amount described in clause (1) above; 112 Back to Contents will be deposited to the Series Distribution Account for Class C and will be owned by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will use this amount to repay principal outstanding on the Medium Term Note Certificate. Starting on the earlier of (1) if the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account exceeds the sum of the Class A Investor Interest, the Class B Investor Interest and the Class C Investor Interest, the Series Scheduled Redemption Date, and (2) during the Rapid Amortisation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, the Class D Principal Commencement Date, and on each Distribution Date after that, the receivables trustee will distribute the following amounts in the following priority: (1) from the Principal Funding Account, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account in excess of the sum of the Class A Investor Interest, the Class B Investor Interest and the Class C Investor Interest; and (b) the Class D Investor Interest; will be deposited in the Series Distribution Account for Class D and will be owned by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will use this amount to repay principal outstanding on the medium term note certificate. (2) from the Series Distribution Ledger, an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount credited to the Series Distribution Ledger; and (b) the Class D Investor Interest after taking into account the amount described in clause (1) above; will be deposited to the Series Distribution Account for Class D and will be owned by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will use this amount to repay principal outstanding on the medium term note certificate. Postponement of Controlled Accumulation Period The Controlled Accumulation Period is scheduled to begin on the date specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms (the  Controlled Accumulation Period Commencement Date ). If the Controlled Accumulation Period Length, which is explained in the next paragraph, is less than 12 months, the Revolving Period may be extended and the start of the Controlled Accumulation Period will be postponed. On the Determination Date right before the commencement of the Controlled Accumulation Period for a potential series, and on each Determination Date after that, until the Controlled Accumulation Period begins, the servicer will determine the  Controlled Accumulation Period Length . This is the number of months that the servicer expects will be needed to fully fund the Principal Funding Account no later than the Series Scheduled Redemption Date. This calculation is based on: (i) the expected monthly principal collections that the servicer calculates will be available to the investor interests of all series other than excluded series, assuming a principal payment rate no greater than the lowest monthly principal payment rate on the receivables for the twelve months before; and (ii) the amount of principal expected to be distributable to the investor interests of all series in group one  other than Companion Series  that are not expected to be in their revolving periods during the Controlled Accumulation Period. If the Controlled Accumulation Period Length is less than twelve months, the servicer may, at its option, postpone the start of the Controlled Accumulation Period such that the number of calendar months in the Controlled Accumulation Period will be at least equal to the Controlled Accumulation Period Length. 113 Back to Contents The effect of this is to permit the reduction of the length of the Controlled Accumulation Period based on the investor interest of future series that are scheduled to be in their revolving periods during the Controlled Accumulation Period and on increases in the principal payment rate occurring after the relevant closing date. The length of the Controlled Accumulation Period will not be less than one month. Unavailable Principal Collections If: (i) during the Controlled Accumulation Period or the Regulated Amortisation Period, the amount credited to the Principal Collections Ledger identified for the relevant series during any monthly period minus the amount of Investor Cash Available for Acquisition calculated the relevant series for that monthly period, exceeds the sum of: (1) the Adjusted Investor Interest as of the last day of the prior monthly period, after taking into account any deposits to be made to the Principal Funding Account on the Transfer Date for that monthly period, any unreimbursed Investor ChargeOffs for any class and any other adjustments to the investor interest for that monthly period; and (2) any Reallocated Class B Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections or Reallocated Class D Principal Collections on the Transfer Date for that monthly period; or (ii) during the Rapid Amortisation Period, the amount credited to the Principal Collections Ledger identified for the relevant series during any monthly period exceeds the sum of: (1) the investor interest as of the last day of the prior monthly period, after taking into account any deposits to be made to the Series Distribution Account on the Transfer Date for that monthly period, any unreimbursed Investor ChargeOffs for any class and any other adjustments to the investor interest for that monthly period; and (2) any Reallocated Class B Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections or Reallocated Class D Principal Collections on the Transfer Date for that monthly period the amount of any excess will be allocated and transferred to the originator beneficiary only to the extent that the Originator Interest on that date is greater than zero. If the Originator Interest on that date is not greater than zero, the amount will be identified as unavailable originator principal collections credited to the Principal Collections Ledger. This sum, together with any unavailable investor principal collections that have been credited to the Principal Collections Ledger, will be identified as  Unavailable Principal Collections . Unavailable investor principal collections are principal collections identified for the originator beneficiary but not transferred to the originator beneficiary because the Originator Interest at the relevant date is not greater than zero. Unavailable Principal Collections will, to the extent they arise during the Revolving Period, be allocated to the originator beneficiary but will be transferred to the originator beneficiary only if and to the extent that the Originator Interest at that time is greater than zero. On each Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period, Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, any Unavailable Principal Collections which arise after the end of the Revolving Period which are credited to the Principal Collections Ledger will be allocated to the investor beneficiary and included as Investor Principal Collections to be distributed as Available Investor Principal Collections. Shared Principal Collections Principal collections for any monthly period allocated to the investor interest of each series, which are not required as Reallocated Class B Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections or Reallocated Class D Principal Collections will first be used to cover: (i) until the Series Scheduled Redemption Date, for any monthly period during the Controlled Accumulation Period, deposits of the Controlled Deposit Amount to the Principal Funding Account; 114 Back to Contents (ii) during the Regulated Amortisation Period, deposits of the Controlled Deposit Amount to the relevant Series Distribution Account; and (iii) during the Controlled Accumulation Period, on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and during the Rapid Amortisation Period, payments to the MTN issuing entity for the relevant series. The receivables trustee will determine the amount of principal collections for any monthly period allocated to the investor interest remaining after covering required distributions to the MTN issuing entity for each class of the relevant series and any similar amount remaining for any other outstanding series in group one. These remaining principal collections are called  Shared Principal Collections . The receivables trustee will allocate the Shared Principal Collections to cover any scheduled or permitted principal distributions to beneficiaries, and deposits to principal funding accounts, if any, for any series in group one that have not been covered out of the principal collections allocable to that series. These uncovered principal distributions and deposits are called  Principal Shortfalls . Shared Principal Collections will not be used to cover investor chargeoffs for any class of any series. If Principal Shortfalls exceed Shared Principal Collections for any monthly period, Shared Principal Collections will be allocated in proportion among the outstanding series in group one based on the amounts of Principal Shortfalls for each series. To the extent that Shared Principal Collections exceed Principal Shortfalls, the balance will in the normal course be paid to the originator beneficiary. Defaulted Receivables; Investor Charge-Offs On each Transfer Date, the receivables trustee will calculate the Investor Default Amount for the previous monthly period. The  Investor Default Amount  will be the total of, for each Defaulted Account, the product of the Floating Investor Percentage and the Default Amount. The  Default Amount  for any Defaulted Account will be the amount of eligible principal receivables in the Defaulted Account on the day the account became a Defaulted Account. The Investor Default Amount will be calculated for each notional class of the relevant series based on its floating allocation during the monthly period. These allocations will be called the  Class A Investor Default Amount , the  Class B Investor Default Amount , the  Class C Investor Default Amount  and the  Class D Investor Default Amount . On each Transfer Date, if the Class A Investor Default Amount for the prior monthly period exceeds the sum of: (i) Available Funds; (ii) Reallocated Class D Principal Collections; (iii) Reallocated Class C Principal Collections; and (iv) Reallocated Class B Principal Collections; in each case, to the extent available to cover the Class A Investor Default Amount, then the Class D Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount of the excess, but not by more than the remaining Class A Investor Default Amount. This reduction to the Class D Investor Interest will be made only after giving effect to reductions to the Class D Investor Interest for any Class D Investor Charge-Offs, any Reallocated Class B Principal Collections, Reallocated Class C Principal Collections and Reallocated Class D Principal Collections. If this reduction would cause the Class D Investor Interest to be a negative number, it will be reduced to zero. In this case, the Class C Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount by which the Class B Investor Interest would have been reduced below zero, but not by more than the Class B Investor Default Amount not covered by a reduction in the Class D Investor Interest. This reduction in the Class C Investor Interest will be made only after giving effect to reductions for any Class C Investor Charge-Offs and Reallocated Class C Principal Collections not covered by a reduction in the Class D Investor Interest. If this reduction would cause the Class C Investor Interest to be a negative number, it will be reduced to zero. In this case, the Class B Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount by which the 115 Back to Contents Class C Investor Interest would have been reduced below zero, but not by more than the Class A Investor Default Amount not covered by a reduction in the Class C Investor Interest. This reduction in the Class B Investor Interest will be made only after giving effect to reductions for any Class B Investor ChargeOffs and Reallocated Class B Principal Collections not covered by a reduction in the Class C Investor Interest. If this reduction would cause the Class B Investor Interest to be a negative number, the Class B Investor Interest will be reduced to zero. In this case, the Class A Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount by which the Class B Investor Interest would have been reduced below zero, but not by more than the remaining Class A Investor Default Amount not covered by a reduction in the Class C Investor Interest or the Class B Investor Interest. This is called a  Class A Investor Charge-Off  and may have the effect of slowing or reducing the return of principal to the MTN issuing entity calculated in respect of Class A. If the Class A Investor Interest has been reduced by any Class A Investor Charge-Offs, it will be reimbursed on any Transfer Date by the amount of Available Funds allocated and available for that purpose, but not by more than the total amount by which the Class A Investor Interest has been reduced. See   Application of Available Funds . On each Transfer Date, if the Class B Investor Default Amount for the prior monthly period exceeds the sum of: (i) Available Funds; (ii) Reallocated Class D Principal Collections; and (iii) Reallocated Class C Principal Collections, in each case, to the extent available to cover the Class B Investor Default Amount, then the Class D Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount of the excess, but not by more than the remaining Class B Investor Default Amount. This reduction to the Class D Investor Interest will be made only after giving effect to reductions to the Class D Investor Interest for any Class D Investor Charge-Offs, any Reallocated Class C Principal Collections and Reallocated Class D Principal Collections. If this reduction would cause the Class D Investor Interest to be a negative number, it will be reduced to zero. In this case, the Class C Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount by which the Class D Investor Interest would have been reduced below zero, but not by more than the Class B Investor Default Amount not covered by a reduction in the Class D Investor Interest. This reduction in the Class C Investor Interest will be made only after giving effect to reductions for any Class C Investor Charge-Offs and Reallocated Class C Principal Collections not covered by a reduction in the Class D Investor Interest. If this reduction would cause the Class C Investor Interest to be a negative number, the Class C Investor Interest will be reduced to zero. In this case, the Class B Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount by which the Class C Investor Interest would have been reduced below zero, but not by more than the remaining Class B Investor Default Amount not covered by a reduction in the Class D Investor Interest or the Class C Investor Interest. This is called a  Class B Investor Charge-Off  and may have the effect of slowing or reducing the return of principal to the MTN issuing entity calculated in respect of Class A. If the Class B Investor Interest has been reduced by any Class B Investor Charge-Offs, it will be reimbursed on any Transfer Date by the amount of Available Funds allocated and available for that purpose, but not by more than the total amount by which the Class A Investor Interest has been reduced. See   Application of Available Funds . On each Transfer Date, if the Class C Investor Default Amount for the prior monthly period exceeds the sum of: (i) Available Funds; and (ii) Reallocated Class D Principal Collections, in each case to the extent available to cover the Class C Investor Default Amount, then the Class D Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount of the excess, but not by more than the remaining Class C Investor Default Amount. This reduction to the Class D Investor Interest will be made only after giving 116 Back to Contents effect to any reductions to the Class D Investor Interest for any Class D Investor Charge-Offs, any Reallocated Class C Principal Collections, any Reallocated Class D Principal Collections and any reductions in the Class D Investor Interest to cover the Class A Investor Default Amount and Class B Investor Default Amount. If this reduction would cause the Class D Investor Interest to be a negative number, it will be reduced to zero. In this case, the Class C Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount by which the Class D Investor Interest would have been reduced below zero, but not by more than the remaining Class C Investor Default Amount not covered by a reduction to the Class D Investor Interest. This is called a  Class C Investor Charge-Off  and may have the effect of slowing or reducing the return of principal to the MTN issuing entity calculated in respect of Class C. If the Class C Investor Interest has been reduced for any reasons other than the payment of principal, it will be reimbursed on any Transfer Date by the amount of Available Funds allocated and available for that purpose, but not by more than the total amount by which the Class C Investor Interest has been reduced. See   Application of Available Funds . On each Transfer Date, if the Class D Investor Default Amount for the prior monthly period exceeds the amount of Available Funds available to cover the Class D Investor Default Amount, the Class D Investor Interest will be reduced by the amount of the excess, but not by more than the Class D Investor Default Amount. This is called a  Class D Investor Charge-Off , which may have the effect of slowing or reducing the return of principal to the MTN issuing entity calculated in respect of Class D. If the Class D Investor Interest has been reduced for any reasons other than the payment of principal, it will be reimbursed on any Transfer Date by the amount of Available Funds allocated and available for that purpose, but not by more than the total amount by which the Class D Investor Interest has been so reduced. See   Application of Available Funds . Extra Amount The relevant  Series Extra Amount  is calculated as follows: Days in Calculation Period 365 (366 in a leap year) x the greater of (i) £1200 and (ii) the aggregate of £600 per series outstanding during the course of the previous 365) days (366 in a leap year x 2 Aggregate Investor Indemnity Amount By each Transfer Date, the receivables trustee will calculate the Aggregate Investor Indemnity Amount for each outstanding series. The  Aggregate Investor Indemnity Amount  is the sum of all Investor Indemnity Amounts for the related monthly period. An  Investor Indemnity Amount  means for any series, the amount of any Originator Section 75 Liability claimed from the receivables trustee by the originator under the trust section 75 indemnity allocated to that series, calculated as follows: Originator Section 75 Liability x Floating Investor Percentage for that series The  Originator Section 75 Liability  is the liability that the originator has for any Designated Account because of Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. The Originator Section 75 Liability cannot exceed the original outstanding face amount of the principal receivable relating to the transaction giving rise to the liability. See  Risk Factors: Application of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 May Impede Collection Efforts and Could Cause Early Redemption of the Notes or a Loss on your Notes . Aggregate Investor Indemnity Amounts for each series will be payable only if amounts are available from Available Funds to pay them. See   Application of Available Funds . If Available Funds available on any Transfer Date is not enough to pay the Aggregate Investor Indemnity Amount for the 117 Back to Contents relevant series otherwise payable on that date, the excess will be carried forward and paid on subsequent Transfer Dates to the extent amounts of Available Funds are available to pay them. Principal Funding Account The receivables trustee will establish and maintain the Principal Funding Account at a Qualified Institution  currently Barclays Bank PLC at its branch located at 1234 Pavilion Drive Northampton NN4 7SG  as a segregated Trust Account held for the benefit of the MTN issuing entity as the investor beneficiary for the relevant series and the originator beneficiary. During the Controlled Accumulation Period, the receivables trustee will transfer the amounts described under   Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Principal Collections to the MTN issuing entity  to the Principal Funding Account. Funds on deposit in the Principal Funding Account will be invested to the following Transfer Date by the receivables trustee in permitted investments. Investment earnings, net of investment losses and expenses, on funds on deposit in the Principal Funding Account are called  Principal Funding Investment Proceeds . Principal Funding Investment Proceeds will be used to pay the Covered Amount. The  Covered Amount  is calculated as follows: Days in the Calculation Period 365 (366 in a leap year) x The Class A Finance Rate x The amount equal to the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account where the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account is calculated as of the last day of the monthly period before the monthly period in which the relevant Transfer Date occurs. Where the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account is calculated as of the last day of the monthly period before the monthly period in which the relevant Transfer Date occurs. Principal Funding Investment Proceeds up to the Covered Amount will be transferred to the Trustee Collection Account by each Transfer Date and credited to the Finance Charge Collections Ledger for application as Available Funds. If on any Transfer Date during the Controlled Accumulation Period, the Principal Funding Investment Proceeds exceed the Covered Amount, that excess will be paid to the originator beneficiary. If the Principal Funding Investment Proceeds are less than the Covered Amount, a withdrawal will be made from the Re-investment Account  to the extent funds are available  and will be deposited in the Finance Charge Collections Ledger, for application as Available Funds. The amount of this withdrawal will be reduced to the extent Available Funds would be available for deposit in the Re-investment Account. See   Re-investment Account  and   Application of Available Funds . Re-investment Account The receivables trustee will establish and maintain a Re-investment account at a Qualified Institution  currently, Barclays Bank PLC at its branch located at 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP  as a Trust Account segregated for the benefit of each series. This account is called the  Re-investment Account . The Re-investment Account will be established to assist with the payment distribution of the Class A Monthly Finance Amount to the MTN issuing entity during the Controlled Accumulation Period. On each Transfer Date from and after the Re-investment Account Funding Date, but before the termination of the Re-investment Account, the receivables trustee will apply Available Funds in the order of priority described in   Application of Available Funds  to increase the amount on deposit in the Re-investment Account, up to the Required Re-investment Amount. If, on or before the Re-investment Account Funding Date, the originator beneficiary designates a lesser amount, it must provide the servicer and the receivables trustee with evidence that each rating agency has notified the originator, the servicer and the receivables trustee that that lesser amount will not result in the rating agency reducing or withdrawing its then existing rating of any outstanding Related Beneficiary Debt. Also, the originator beneficiary must deliver to the receivables trustee an officers 118 Back to Contents certificate to the effect that, based on the facts known to that officer at that time, in the reasonable belief of the originator beneficiary, the designation will not cause a Pay Out Event to occur or an event that, after the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would cause a Pay Out Event to occur. Further, this designation will not be effective without the prior written agreement of all the other beneficiaries. On each Transfer Date, after giving effect to any deposit to be made to, and any withdrawal to be made from, the Re-investment Account on that Transfer Date, the receivables trustee will withdraw from the Re-investment Account an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount on deposit in the Re-investment Account over the Required Re-investment Amount. The receivables trustee will distribute this amount to the originator beneficiary and it will cease to be the property of the receivables trust. All amounts on deposit in the Re-investment Account on any Transfer Date will be invested by the receivables trustee in permitted investments to the following Transfer Date. This will be done after giving effect to any deposits to, or withdrawals from, the Re-investment Account to be made on that Transfer Date. The interest and other income  net of investment expenses and losses  earned on the investments will be retained in the Re-investment Account if the amount on deposit in the Re-investment Account is less than the Required Re-investment Amount. If the amount on deposit is equal to or more than the Required Re-investment Amount, it will be credited to the Finance Charge Collections Ledger to be included in the Available Funds. On each Transfer Date for the Controlled Accumulation Period before the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and on the first Transfer Date during the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, the receivables trustee will withdraw an amount from the Re-investment Account and deposit it in the Trustee Collection Account for credit to the Finance Charge Collections Ledger to be included in Available Funds. This amount will be equal to the lesser of: (i) the available amount on deposit in the Re-investment Account; and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Covered Amount is greater than the Principal Funding Investment Proceeds. The amount of this withdrawal will be reduced to the extent Available Funds would be available for deposit in the Re-investment Account. The Re-investment Account will be terminated following the earliest to occur of: (i) the termination of the receivables trust; (ii) the earlier of the first Transfer Date after the start of the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period; and (iii) the Series Termination Date. When the Re-investment Account terminates, all amounts still on deposit in the Re-investment Account will be treated as part of the Excess Interest attributable to the relevant series and will be paid to the MTN issuing entity and will no longer be the property of the receivables trust. Series Cash Reserve Account The receivables trustee will establish and maintain for each series a series cash reserve account at a Qualified Institution  currently Barclays Bank PLC at its branch located at 1234 Pavilion Drive, Northampton NN4 7SG  as a segregated Trust Account held for the benefit of the MTN issuing entity as the investor beneficiary and the originator beneficiary. Each series cash reserve account is called the  Series Cash Reserve Account . The Series Cash Reserve Account will be used to fund shortfalls in Available Funds in the order of priority described in   Application of Available Funds . No amounts will be deposited into the Series Cash Reserve Account on the relevant closing date, but if the amount on deposit in a Series Cash Reserve Account is less than the Required Series Cash Reserve Account Amount, then the Series Cash Reserve Account will be funded by Available Funds as described above in item (18) under  Application of Available Funds . 119 Back to Contents The  Required Series Cash Reserve Account Amount  will be determined monthly and will be equal to the product of the Series Cash Reserve Account Percentage and: (i) during the Revolving Period or the Controlled Accumulation Period, the current Adjusted Investor Interest, or (ii) during the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, the Adjusted Investor Interest as of the last day of the Revolving Period or, if the Controlled Accumulation Period has started, as of the last day of the Controlled Accumulation Period. The Required Series Cash Reserve Account Amount, however, will never exceed the Series Debt Amount. The  Series Cash Reserve Account Percentage  shall mean, in respect of any series, the quarterly excess spread percentage specified in the prospectus supplement/final terms for the related series. The quarterly excess spread percentage will be calculated on each Determination Date and will be a percentage equal to the average of the Portfolio Yields for the three prior months less the average of the Expense Rates for the same three months. The quarterly excess spread percentage for the first Determination Date will be calculated using the Portfolio Yield for the prior month divided by the Expense Rate for the same month. The quarterly excess spread percentage for the second Determination Date will be calculated using the average of the Portfolio Yields for the prior two months divided by the average of the Expense Rates for the same two months. All amounts on deposit in the Series Cash Reserve Account on any Transfer Date will be invested by the receivables trustee in permitted investments to the next Transfer Date. For purposes of the Series Cash Reserve Account, permitted investments will include investments rated A1 by Standard & Poors, and P1 by Moodys. This will be done after giving effect to any deposits to, or withdrawals from, the Series Cash Reserve Account made on that Transfer Date. The interest and other investment income  net of investment expenses and losses  earned on the investments will be retained in the Series Cash Reserve Account if the amount on deposit in the Series Cash Reserve Account is less than the Required Series Cash Reserve Account Amount. If the amount on deposit in the Series Cash Reserve Account is at least equal to the Required Series Cash Reserve Account Amount then it will be paid to the originator beneficiary. On each Transfer Date, the receivables trustee will withdraw from available funds on deposit in the Series Cash Reserve Account an amount equal to the Available Series Cash Reserve Account Amount and apply it to the Finance Charge Collections Ledger as Available Funds. Any amount on deposit in the Series Cash Reserve Account that exceeds the Required Series Cash Reserve Account Amount will be withdrawn by the receivables trustee and will be treated as part of the Excess Interest attributable to the relevant series and will be paid to the MTN issuing entity. Also, on the earlier of: (i) the termination of the receivables trust; and (ii) the Series Termination Date, any amounts still on deposit in either the Series Cash Reserve Account, after making any deposit or withdrawal described above, will be withdrawn by the receivables trustee and treated as part of the Excess Interest attributable to the relevant series and will be paid to the MTN issuing entity. Distribution Ledgers The receivables trustee will establish distribution ledgers for each series in the Trustee Collection Account. On each Transfer Date it will credit and debit amounts to these ledgers as described throughout this section of this base prospectus. All amounts credited to the Series Distribution Ledger will be regarded as being segregated for the benefit of the MTN issuing entity. 120 Back to Contents Trustee Payment Amount The share of the Trustee Payment Amount payable on any Transfer Date that is allocable to each series  called the  Investor Trustee Payment Amount   will be calculated as follows: investor interest for the relevant series Total of investor interests of series for which the Trustee Payment Amount was incurred x Trustee Payment Amount The Investor Trustee Payment Amount for any class will be payable from amounts available for distribution for that purpose out of Available Funds. See  Allocation, Calculation and Distribution of Finance Charge Collections to the MTN issuing entity  and   Finance Charge Waterfall . The portion of the Trustee Payment Amount not allocated to the relevant series will be paid from cashflows under the receivables trust allocated to other outstanding series, and in no event will the relevant series be liable for these payments. Qualified Institutions If the bank or banks at which any of the accounts listed below are held cease to be a Qualified Institution, then the receivables trustee will, within 10 Business Days, establish a new account to replace the affected account or accounts, and will transfer any cash and Interest to that new account or accounts. The accounts referred to above are: (i) Trustee Collection Account; (ii) Trustee Acquisition Account; (iii) Re-investment Account; (iv) Series Cash Reserve Account; (v) Principal Funding Account; and (vi) Series Distribution Account. The receivables trustee may in its discretion elect to move any or all of these accounts and the amounts credited to them from the Qualified Institution at which they are kept as at the date of this document to another or other Qualified Institutions. Series Pay Out Events The events described below are called  Series Pay Out Events : (1) failure on the part of the originator: (a) to make any payment or deposit required by the terms of the Receivables Securitisation Agreement within five Business Days after the date that the payment or deposit is required to be made; or (b) duly to observe or perform any covenants or agreements of the originator in the Receivables Securitisation Agreement or the series supplement that has a material adverse effect on the interests of the MTN issuing entity in respect of the relevant series and which continues unremedied for a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice of the failure, requiring it to be remedied, is given to the originator by the receivables trustee, or is given to the originator and the receivables trustee by the investor beneficiary for the relevant series acting on the instructions of holders of the relevant medium term note certificate representing together 50 per cent. or more of the total balance of the relevant medium term note certificate outstanding at that time, and which unremedied continues during that 60 day period to have a material adverse effect on the interests of the MTN issuing entity in respect of the relevant series for that period; 121 Back to Contents (2) any representation or warranty made by the originator in the Receivables Securitisation Agreement or the series supplement, or any information contained in a computer file or microfiche list required to be delivered by the originator under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement: (a) proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or when delivered and continues to be incorrect in any material respect for a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice of the error, requiring it to be remedied, is given to the originator by the receivables trustee, or is given to the originator and the receivables trustee by the investor beneficiary for the relevant series acting on the instructions of holders of the relevant medium term note certificate representing together 50 per cent. or more of the total balance of the relevant medium term note certificate outstanding; and (b) as a result of which there is a material adverse effect on the interests of the MTN issuing entity in respect of the relevant series and which unremedied continues during that 60 day period to have a material adverse effect for that period; Notwithstanding the above, no Series Pay-Out Event in relation to (2) shall be deemed to have occurred if the originator has complied with its obligations for a breach of warranty as set out in the Receivables Securitisation Agreement. (3) the average Portfolio Yield for any three consecutive monthly periods is less than the average Expense Rate for those periods, or on any Determination Date before the end of the third monthly period from the relevant closing date the Portfolio Yield is less than the average Expense Rate for that period; (4) either: (a) over any period of thirty consecutive days, the Originator Interest averaged over that period is less than the Minimum Originator Interest for that period and the Originator Interest does not increase on or before the tenth Business Day following that thirty day period to an amount so that the average of the Originator Interest as a percentage of the Average Principal Receivables for such thirty day period, computed by assuming that the amount of the increase of the Originator Interest by the last day of the ten Business Day period, as compared to the Originator Interest on the last day of the thirty day period, would have existed in the receivables trust during each day of the thirty day period, is at least equal to the Minimum Originator Interest; or (b) on the last day of any monthly period the total balance of Eligible Receivables is less than the Minimum Aggregate Principal Receivables, adjusted for any series having a Companion Series as described in the supplement for that series, and the total balance of Eligible Receivables fails to increase to an amount equal to or greater than the Minimum Aggregate Principal Receivables on or before the tenth Business Day following that last day; (5) any servicer default or trust cash manager default occurs that would have a material adverse effect on the MTN issuing entity in respect of the relevant series; (6) the investor interest is not reduced to zero on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date; (7) the early termination, without replacement, of any of the Swap Agreements as described in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms; (8) the MTN issuing entity is required to withhold or deduct any amounts for or on account of tax on the payment of any principal or Interest in respect of the medium term note certificate. If any event described in paragraphs (1), (2) or (5) occurs then, after the applicable grace period, either (1) the receivables trustee or (2) the investor beneficiary may declare that a Series Pay Out Event has occurred if the correct notice has been given. If the investor beneficiary declares that a Series Pay 122 Back to Contents Out Event has occurred, it must have acted on the instructions of holders of the medium term note certificate representing, together, 50 per cent. or more of the medium term note certificate outstanding at that time. The investor beneficiary must give a written notice to the originator, the servicer and the receivables trustee that a Series Pay Out Event has occurred. If the receivables trustee declares that a Series Pay Out Event has occurred, it must give a written notice to this effect to the originator, the servicer and the trust cash manager. A Series Pay Out Event will be effective as of the date of the relevant notice. If any event in paragraphs (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) occurs, a Series Pay Out Event will occur without any notice or other action on the part of the receivables trustee or the investor beneficiary. Entitlement of MTN Issuing Entity to Series Excess Interest Barclays Bank PLC will enter into an  Agreement Between Beneficiaries  with the MTN issuing entity under which Barclays Bank PLC will transfer its Excess Interest entitlement attributable to each series to the MTN issuing entity. The portion of the Excess Interest so transferred will form part of the investor interest. The MTN issuing entity will pay amounts of Excess Interest attributable to each series which it receives pursuant to the agreement between the beneficiaries to the issuing entity as  MTN issuing entity additional interest payments . In return for the transfer of the entitlement to the portion of the Excess Interest relating to each series the MTN issuing entity will agree to pay deferred consideration to Barclays Bank PLC. We will refer to this deferred consideration as  Excess Entitlement Consideration . The amount of the Excess Entitlement Consideration in respect of each series will be equal to the amount of Deferred Subscription Price which the MTN issuing entity receives from the issuing entity in respect of the medium term note certificate from time to time. The issuing entity will apply any MTN issuing entity additional interest payments received by it in meeting its due and payable obligations. Any sums remaining following satisfaction of all amounts due and payable by the issuing entity, which we will refer to as  Unutilised Excess Spread , will be paid to the MTN issuing entity as Deferred Subscription Price for the medium term note certificate for as long as the medium term note certificate is in issue. Your Payment Flows On each Distribution Date, the receivables trustee will transfer from available funds in the Trustee Collection Account the sum of: (i) the Class A Monthly Distribution Amount; (ii) the Class B Monthly Distribution Amount; (iii) the Class C Monthly Distribution Amount; (iv) the Class D Monthly Distribution Amount; (v) on the Series Termination Date, an amount equal to the principal calculated as payable in accordance with the Expenses Loan Agreement, if any; and (vi) the Excess Interest attributable to the relevant series; and deposit that sum into the Series Distribution Account held by the MTN issuing entity. The MTN issuing entity will credit the amount received in respect of the monthly distribution amounts for each class and the portion of the Excess Interest attributable to the relevant series to the MTN issuing entity coupon ledger and will record for calculational purposes the amounts treated as referable to each class. The MTN issuing entity will then transfer from the Series Distribution Account to the extent there are sufficient funds on deposit: (i) first, the costs and expenses of the MTN issuing entity for the relevant monthly period; (ii) second, the lesser of (1) the amounts credited to the MTN issuing entity coupon ledger, after paying or reserving for the MTN issuing entitys costs and expenses described in the first bullet point above and (2) the interest due and payable on the medium term note certificate, excluding 123 Back to Contents the MTN issuing entity additional interest payments, will be deposited in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account; (iii) third, an amount equal to the Monthly Loan Expenses Amount plus, on the Series Termination Date, an amount equal to the principal calculated as payable in accordance with the Expenses Loan Agreement, if any, will be deposited in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account; (iv) fourth, an amount equal to 1/2 of the Series Extra Amount will be paid to the MTN issuing entity; (v) fifth, an amount equal to 1/2 of the Series Extra Amount will be deposited in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account; (vi) sixth, an amount equal to the MTN issuing entity additional interest payments will be deposited in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account. Note coupon ledgers will be established for each class of notes in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account. On each Interest Payment Date the issuing entity will credit: (i) to the class A notes coupon ledger an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount deposited in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account and (2) the sum of the Class A Monthly Finance Amount, the Class A Deficiency Amount and the Class A Additional Finance Amount; (ii) to the class B notes coupon ledger an amount equal to the lesser of, (1) the amount deposited in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account minus the amount credited to the class A notes coupon ledger and (2) the Class B Monthly Distribution Amount; (iii) to the class C notes coupon ledger an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount deposited in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account minus the amount credited to the class A notes coupon ledger and the class B notes coupon ledger and the Monthly Loan Expenses Amount and (2) the Class C Monthly Distribution Amount; and (iv) to the class D notes coupon ledger, if applicable, an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount deposited in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account minus the amount credited to the class A notes coupon ledger, the class B notes coupon ledger, the class C notes coupon ledger and the Monthly Loan Expenses Amount and (2) the Class D Monthly Distribution Amount. In addition, the MTN issuing entity will pay amounts equal to any amounts received from the issuing entity as Deferred Subscription Price to Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to an Agreement Between Beneficiaries, to the extent not required by the MTN issuing entity to make other payments on that date. Before the delivery of an Enforcement Notice in relation to a particular series, on each Interest Payment Date, the issuing entity will pay: (i) first, from MTN issuing entity additional interest, the costs and expenses of the issuing entity for the relevant monthly period will be paid or reserved for within the issuing entity; (ii) second, the costs and expenses of the issuing entity for the relevant monthly period remaining after the first item will be paid or reserved for within the issuing entity proportionately to the class A notes, the class B notes, the class C notes and the class D notes share, if any, for such payment to be used to pay, or reserve for, the costs and expenses of the issuing entity; (iii) third, from the class A notes coupon ledger, the lesser of (1) the amount credited to the class A notes coupon ledger after paying or reserving for the class A notes proportionate share of the issuing entitys costs and (2) expenses and the amounts due and payable, if applicable, to a swap counterparty under a class A swap agreement (other than amounts payable under item (xiii) below) for the relevant Calculation Period, to the relevant swap counterparty and upon payment to the issuing entity by the swap counterparty in exchange therefor, to the holder of a class A note (or, to the extent that a class A swap agreement has been terminated and not replaced, the 124 Back to Contents lesser of (i) the amount in (1) above converted into the relevant currently at the spot exchange rate and (ii) the amount due under a class A note to the holder of the class A note); (iv) fourth, from the class B notes coupon ledger, the lesser of (1) the amount credited to the class B notes coupon ledger after paying or reserving for the class B notes proportionate share of the issuing entitys costs and (2) the amounts due and payable, if applicable, to a swap counterparty under a class B swap agreement (other than amounts payable under item (xiv) below) for the relevant Calculation Period, to the relevant swap counterparty and upon payment to the issuing entity by the swap counterparty in exchange therefor, to the holder of a class B note (or, to the extent that a class B swap agreement has been terminated and not replaced, the lesser of (i) the amount in (1) above converted into the relevant currency at the spot exchange rate and (ii) the amount due under a Class B note to the holder of the class B note;

(vii) seventh, from the class D notes coupon ledger, if applicable, the lesser of (1) the amount credited to the class D notes coupon ledger after paying or reserving for the class D notes proportionate share of the issuing entitys costs and (2) the amounts due and payable, if applicable, to the swap counterparty under a class D swap agreement (other than amounts payable under item (xvi) below) in respect of the relevant Calculation Period, to the relevant swap counterparty and upon payment to the issuing entity by the swap counterparty in exchange therefor to the holder of a class D note, if any, (or, to the extent a class D swap agreement has been terminated and not replaced, the lesser of (i) the amount in (1) above converted into the relevant currency at the spot exchange rate and (ii) the amount due under a Class D note to the holder of the class D note; (viii) eighth, the lesser of the remaining amount on deposit in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account and an amount equal to the principal calculated as payable in accordance with the Expenses Loan Agreement, if any, will be paid to the lender under the Expenses Loan Agreement; (ix) ninth, the lesser of the remaining amount on deposit in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account and an amount equal to ½ of the Series Extra Amount, will be paid to the issuing entity; (x) tenth, any amounts due from or required to be provided for by the issuing entity to meet its liabilities to any taxation authority; (xi) eleventh, any amounts due to third parties under obligations incurred in the course of the issuing entitys business; (xii) twelfth, an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount on deposit in the additional interest ledger of the Issuing Entity Distribution Account (such amount to be denominated in the relevant currency or, if not dominated in the relevant currency, such amount will be converted into the relevant currency at the spot exchange rate); and (B) the amount needed to cover any shortfall with respect to the notes caused by the imposition of withholding taxes on payments made under the medium term note certificate or the Swap Agreements, will be paid to the relevant noteholders; (xiii) thirteenth, the amount equal to any termination payment due and payable to a swap counterparty pursuant to a class A swap agreement where the class A swap agreement has been terminated as a result of a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default; 125 Back to Contents (xiv) fourteenth, the amount equal to any termination payment due and payable to a swap counterparty pursuant to a class B swap agreement where the class B swap agreement has been terminated as a result of a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default;

(xvii) seventeenth, any amounts remaining will constitute Deferred Subscription Price and will be paid to the MTN issuing entity. Under the terms of each swap agreement, each swap counterparty will pay to the issuing entity on each Interest Payment Date an amount equal to the interest to be paid on the applicable class of notes, converted, if applicable, into the relevant currency at the exchange rate set out in the relevant swap agreement, subject to the deferral of interest as described in  Terms and Conditions of the Notes  and  The Swap Agreements  section of the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. After the termination of the Swap Agreements, the note trustee will withdraw the amounts on deposit in the class A notes coupon ledger, the class B notes coupon ledger, the class C notes coupon ledger and the class D notes coupon ledger, if any, and convert those amounts into the relevant currency at the then prevailing spot exchange rate in London, England and distribute these amounts to the Paying Agent to make payments of interest on the class A notes, the class B notes, the class C notes and, if applicable, the class D notes, respectively. On the earlier of (1) the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and (2) the first Distribution Date for the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, and on each Distribution Date after that, the receivables trustee will transfer the following amounts and deposit them into the Series Distribution Account: (i) from the Principal Funding Account, the lesser of (1) the amount in the Principal Funding Account on that date and (2) the Class A Investor Interest; and (ii) from the Series Distribution Ledger, the lesser of (1) during the Rapid Amortisation Period, the amount in the Series Distribution Ledger or, during the Regulated Amortisation Period, the Controlled Deposit Amount, and (2) the Class A Investor Interest  after taking into account the amount distributed from the Principal Funding Account as described above. On the later to occur of the Class B Principal Commencement Date and the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and each Distribution Date after, the receivables trustee will transfer the following amounts and deposit them into the Series Distribution Account: (i) from the Principal Funding Account, the lesser of (1) the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account in excess of the Class A Investor Interest and (2) the Class B Investor Interest; and (ii) from the Series Distribution Ledger, the lesser of the amount on deposit in the Series Distribution Ledger and the Class B Investor Interest  after taking into account the amount distributed from the Principal Funding Account as described above. On the later to occur of the Class C Principal Commencement Date and the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and each Distribution Date after, the receivables trustee will transfer the following amounts and deposit them into the Series Distribution Account: (i) from the Principal Funding Account, the lesser of (1) the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account in excess of the sum of the Class A Investor Interest and the Class B Investor Interest and (2) the Class C Investor Interest; and 126 Back to Contents (ii) from the Series Distribution Ledger, the lesser of the amount on deposit in the Series Distribution Ledger and the Class C Investor Interest  after taking into account the amount distributed from the Principal Funding Account as described above. If any series provides for class D notes, on the later to occur of the Class D Principal Commencement Date and the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and each Distribution Date after, the receivables trustee will transfer the following amounts and deposit them into the Series Distribution Account: (i) from the Principal Funding Account, the lesser of (1) the amount on deposit in the Principal Funding Account in excess of the sum of the Class A Investor Interest, the Class B Investor Interest and the Class C Investor Interest and (2) the Class D Investor Interest; and (ii) from the Series Distribution Ledger, the lesser of the amount on deposit in the Series Distribution Ledger and the Class D Investor Interest  after taking into account the amount distributed from the Principal Funding Account as described above. The MTN issuing entity will credit the amount received for each class of investor interest to the MTN issuing entity principal ledger. On the earlier of (1) the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and (2) the first Distribution Date for the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, and each Distribution Date after, the MTN issuing entity will transfer for same day value from the Series Distribution Account the amount in the MTN issuing entity principal ledger and deposit it into the Issuing Entity Distribution Account. The issuing entity will credit each amount received from the MTN issuing entity principal ledger to the appropriate notes principal ledger. If applicable, before the termination of any Swap Agreements related to a particular series, on the earlier of (1) the Series Scheduled Redemption Date and (2) the first Interest Payment Date for the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, and each Interest Payment Date after, the issuing entity will pay: (i) from the class A notes principal ledger, an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount in the class A notes principal ledger; and (2) the sterling equivalent of the principal due on the class A notes, to the relevant swap counterparty, if any; (ii) from the class B notes principal ledger, an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount in the class B notes principal ledger and (2) the sterling equivalent of the principal due on the class B notes, to the relevant swap counterparty, if any; (iii) from the class C notes principal ledger, an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount in the class C notes principal ledger and (2) the sterling equivalent of the principal due on the class C notes, to the relevant swap counterparty, if any; and (iv) from the class D notes principal ledger, if applicable, an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount in the class D notes principal ledger and (2) the sterling equivalent of the principal due on the class D notes, to the relevant swap counterparty, if any. Such swap counterparty will pay to the issuing entity, in the relevant currency for such particular series, principal for distribution to the Noteholders converted, if applicable into such currency, at the exchange rate set out in the relevant swap agreement. After the termination of such Swap Agreements, the note trustee will withdraw the amounts on deposit in the class A notes principal ledger, the class B notes principal ledger, the class C notes principal ledger and the class D notes principal ledger and, to the extent necessary, the amounts on deposit in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account representing MTN issuing entity additional interest payments and convert those amounts into the relevant currency for such particular series at the then prevailing spot exchange rate in London, England and distribute those amounts to the Paying Agent to make payments of principal first on the class A notes, then the class B notes, then the class C notes and finally the class D notes, as further described in the relevant Swap Agreements. 127 Back to Contents THE NOTE TRUST DEED The principal agreement governing the notes will be the note trust deed. The note trust deed has five primary functions: (i) it constitutes the notes; (ii) it sets out the covenants of the issuing entity in relation to the notes; (iii) it sets out the enforcement and postenforcement procedures relating to the notes; (iv) it contains provisions necessary to comply with the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the  Trust Indenture Act ); and (v) it sets out the appointment, powers and responsibilities of the note trustee as well as certain limitations on its responsibilities and liabilities. Each function is summarised below. The note trust deed sets out the form of the notes. It also sets out the terms and conditions of the notes, and the conditions for the issue of Individual Note Certificates and/or the cancellation of any notes. The note trust deed also contains covenants made by the issuing entity in favour of the note trustee and the Noteholders. The main covenants are that the issuing entity will pay interest and repay principal on each of the notes when due. Covenants are included to ensure that the issuing entity remains insolvency remote, and to give the note trustee access to all information and reports that it may need in order to discharge its responsibilities in relation to the Noteholders. Some of the covenants also appear in the terms and conditions of the notes, see  Terms and Conditions of the Notes . The issuing entity also covenants that it will use all reasonable endeavours to maintain the listing of the notes on the United Kingdom Official List within the meaning of Part 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and their admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange. The note trust deed sets out the general procedures by which the note trustee may take steps to enforce the security created by the issuing entity in the note trust deed so that the note trustee can protect the interests of the Noteholders in accordance with the terms and conditions. The note trust deed gives the note trustee a general discretion to enforce the security, but also provides for meetings of the Noteholders at which the Noteholders can determine the action taken by the note trustee in relation to the enforcement of the notes (subject to being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction against liabilities it may incur). Additionally, the note trustee is required to act on a written request of a certain proportion of then Noteholders (subject to being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction against liabilities it may incur). The note trust deed provides that the class A Noteholders interests take precedence for so long as the class A n otes are outstanding, after that, the interests of the class B Noteholders take precedence over the interests of class C Noteholders, until no more class B notes remain outstanding, and after that, the interests of the class C Noteholders take precedence over the interests of class D Noteholders, until no more class C notes remain outstanding. Certain basic terms of each class of notes may not be amended without the consent of the majority of the holders of that class of note. This is described further in the  Terms and Conditions of the Notes . The note trust deed also sets out the terms on which the note trustee is appointed, the indemnification of the note trustee, the payment it receives and the extent of the note trustees authority to act beyond its statutory powers under English law. The note trustee is also given the ability to appoint a delegate or agent in the execution of any of its duties under the note trust deed. The note trust deed also sets out the circumstances in which the note trustee may resign or retire. Finally, the note trust deed includes certain provisions mandated by the Trust Indenture Act. Generally, these provisions outline the duties, rights and responsibilities of the note trustee and the issuing entity and the rights of the Noteholders. Specifically these include, but are not limited to: (i) the maintenance of a Noteholder list by the note trustee; (ii) the provision of reports and other information by the issuing entity to the note trustee; 128 Back to Contents (iii) the duty of the note trustee to use the same degree of care in exercising its responsibilities as would be exercised by a prudent person conducting its own affairs; (iv) the duty of the note trustee to notify all Noteholders of any events of default of which it has actual knowledge; and (v) the right of the note trustee to resign at any time by providing the issuing entity with not less than 30 days prior written notice without assigning any reason and without being responsible for any costs occasioned by such retirement, the ability of the issuing entity to remove the note trustee under certain circumstances and the right of the Noteholders by Extraordinary Resolution to remove any note trustee (such removal or resignation shall not become effective until a successor trustee is appointed); and the obligation of the issuing entity to use all reasonable endeavours to procure a new note trustee. The note trust deed contains a provision that, if any other provision of the note trust deed limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision that is required to be included in the note trust deed by, and is not subject to contractual waiver under, the Trust Indenture Act, the Trust Indenture Act provision will prevail. The note trust deed incorporates and supplements the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925 and the Trustee Act 2000 of England and Wales. The note trust deed is governed by English law. 129 Back to Contents THE NOTES The issue of each series of notes will be authorised by a resolution of the board of directors of the issuing entity passed prior to the date of the first issue of notes. Each series of notes will be constituted by a series note trust deed supplement to be dated on or about the relevant closing date between, inter alios , the issuing entity and the note trustee as trustee for, among others, the holders for the time being of the notes. The note trust deed includes provisions which enable it to be modified or supplemented and any reference to the note trust deed is a reference also to the document as modified or supplemented in accordance with its terms. The material terms of the notes are described in this base prospectus. However, the statements set out in this section with regard to the notes and the Global Note Certificates representing the notes are subject to the detailed provisions of the note trust deed and the relevant series note trust deed supplement for a series. The note trust deed will include the forms of the Global Note Certificates and the forms of the Individual Note Certificates. A paying agency and agent bank agreement between, among others, the issuing entity, the note trustee, The Bank of New York in London as  Principal Paying Agent , the other Paying Agents  together with the Principal Paying Agent, called the  Paying Agents   the Registrar and the agent bank, regulates how payments will be made on the notes and how determinations and notifications will be made. It will be dated on or prior to the date of the first issue of notes and the parties will include, on an ongoing basis, any successor party appointed in accordance with its terms. Beneficial owners will be entitled to the benefit of, will be bound by and will be deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the note trust deed and the paying agency and agent bank agreement. Beneficial owners can see copies of these agreements at the principal office for the time being of the note trustee, which is, as of the date of this document, The Bank of New York in London and at the specified office for the time being of each of the Paying Agents. Unless otherwise specified in the relevant series note trust deed supplement, each class of notes will be represented initially by a Global Note Certificate in registered form. The Clearing Systems The Global Note Certificates representing the notes offered by this base prospectus  called the  Global Note Certificates   may be deposited with The Bank of New York in New York, as the DTC custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co. as nominee of, The Depository Trust Company, referred to in this base prospectus as,  DTC . On confirmation from the DTC custodian that it holds the Global Note Certificates, DTC will record BookEntry Interests in the beneficial owners account or the participant account through which the beneficial owner holds its interests in the notes. These BookEntry Interests will represent the beneficial owners or participants beneficial interest in the relevant Global Note Certificates. The Global Note Certificates may also be deposited with, and registered in the name of The Bank of New York Depositary (Nominees) Limited as common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. ( Euroclear ) and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme ( Clearstream, Luxembourg ). On confirmation from the common depositary that it holds the Global Note Certificates, Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or Euroclear, as applicable, will record BookEntry Interests in the beneficial owners account or the participant account through which the beneficial owners hold their interests in the notes. These BookEntry Interests will represent the beneficial owners or participants beneficial interest in the relevant notes represented by such Global Note Certificate. The amount of notes represented by each Global Note Certificate is evidenced by the register maintained for that purpose by the Registrar. The register maintained by the Registrar is the sole evidence of entitlement to the Global Note Certificate. Together, the notes represented by the Global Note Certificates and any outstanding Individual Note Certificates will equal the aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding at any time. However, except as described under   Individual Note Certificates , Individual Note Certificates will not be issued. 130 Back to Contents Book-entry Systems The information set out below is subject to any change in or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and procedures of the clearing systems currently in effect. Investors wishing to use the facilities of any of the clearing systems are advised to confirm the continued applicability of the rules, regulations and procedures of the relevant clearing system. Neither the issuing entity nor any other party to the paying agency and agent bank agreement will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in any series of notes held through the facilities of any clearing system or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. DTC DTC has advised the issuing entity that it is a limited purpose trust company organised under the New York Banking Law, a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for securities that its participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the posttrade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerised bookentry transfers and pledges between participants accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and nonU.S. securities brokers and underwriters, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain o ther organisations. DTC is a whollyowned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ( DTCC ). DTCC, in turn, is owned by a number of participants of DTC and Members of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and Emerging Markets Clearing Corporation (NSCC, FICC and EMCC, also subsidiaries of DTCC), as well as by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange LLC and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as securities brokers and underwriters, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. DTC has S&Ps highest rating: AAA. The DTC rules applicable to DTCs participants and indirect participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. Purchases of notes under the DTC system must be made by or through participants, which will receive a credit for the notes on DTCs records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each note (the beneficial owner) is in turn to be recorded on the participants and indirect participants records. Beneficial owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase, but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the participant or indirect participant through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the notes are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of participants or indirect participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in notes, except in the event that use of the bookentry system for the notes is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all notes deposited by participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTCs partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorised representative of DTC. The deposit of notes with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the notes; DTCs records reflect only the identity of the participants to whose accounts such notes are credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to participants, by participants to indirect participants, and by participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the notes within an issue are being redeemed, DTCs practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each participant in such issue to be redeemed. 131 Back to Contents Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to notes unless authorised by a participant in accordance with DTCs procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the issuing entity as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede & Co.s consenting or voting rights to those participants to whose accounts the notes are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy). Principal and interest payments on the notes will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorised representative of DTC. DTCs practice is to credit participants accounts, upon DTCs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the issuing entity or the principal paying agent, on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTCs records. Payments by participants or indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in street name, and will be the responsibility of such participant or indirect participant and not of DTC or its nominee, the principal paying agent or the issuing entity, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceed s, distributions and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorised representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the issuing entity or the principal paying agent, disbursement of such payments to participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the beneficial owners will be the responsibility of participants and indirect participants. Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear. Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear each hold securities for their participating organisations and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of those participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities. Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear provide various services including safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear also deal with domestic securities markets in several countries through established depository and custodial relationships. Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear have established an electronic bridge between their two systems across which their respective participants may settle trades with each other. Transactions may be settled in Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear in any of numerous c urrencies, including U.S. dollars. Clearstream, Luxembourg is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depository. Clearstream, Luxembourg participants are financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations. Indirect access to Clearstream, Luxembourg is also available to others, including banks, brokers, underwriters and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream, Luxembourg participant, either directly or indirectly. The Euroclear system was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic bookentry delivery against payment. The Euroclear system is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., called the  Euroclear operator . All operations are conducted by the Euroclear operator. All Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear operator. Euroclear participants include banks  including central banks  securities brokers and underwriters and other professional financial intermediaries. Indirect access to the Euroclear system is also available to other firms that maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly. Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear system. These terms and conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within the Euroclear system, withdrawal of securities and cash from the Euroclear system, and receipts of payments for securities in the Euroclear system. All securities in the Euroclear system are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear operator acts under these terms and conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants. As the holders of Book-Entry Interests, beneficial owners will not have the right under the note trust deed to act on solicitations by the issuing entity for action by Noteholders. Beneficial owners will 132 Back to Contents only be able to act to the extent they receive the appropriate proxies to do so from DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear or, if applicable, their respective participants. No assurances are made about these procedures or their adequacy for ensuring timely exercise of remedies under the note trust deed. No beneficial owner of an interest in a note represented by a Global Note Certificate will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the note trust deed, of DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear, as applicable. The laws of some jurisdictions require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. These laws and limitations may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a note represented by a Global Note Certificate. Book-entry ownership of and payments in respect of notes held through DTC The issuing entity may apply to DTC in order to have any class of notes represented by a Global Note Certificate accepted in its book-entry settlement system. Upon the issue of any such Global Note Certificate, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal book-entry system, the respective nominal amounts of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Note Certificate to the accounts of persons who have accounts with DTC. Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the participant. Ownership of beneficial interests in such a Global Note Certificate will be limited to participants or indirect participants, including the respective depositaries of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Ownership of beneficial interests in a Global Note Certificate accepted by DTC will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to the interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to the interests of indirect participants). It should be noted that DTC will only process payments of principal and interest in U.S. dollars. Payments in U.S. dollars of principal and interest in respect of a Global Note Certificate accepted by DTC will be made to the order of DTC or its nominee as the registered holder of such note. In the case of any payment in a currency other than U.S. dollars in respect of a Global Note Certificate accepted by DTC, payment will be made by the exchange agent and the exchange agent will (in accordance with express written instructions received by it) remit all or a portion of such payment for credit directly to the beneficial holders of interests in the Global Note Certificate in the currency in which such payment was made and/or cause all or a portion of such payment to be converted into U.S. dollars and credited to the applicable participants accounts. The issuing entity expects DTC to credit accounts of participants on the applicable payment date in accordance with their respective holdings as shown in the records of DTC unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. The issuing entity also expects that payments by participants or indirect participants to beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers, and will be the responsibility of such participant or indirect participant and not the responsibility of DTC, the Note Trustee or the issuing entity. Payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on notes to DTC is the responsibility of the issuing entity. Payments in respect of notes held through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg Payments by Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions, customary practice, and any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time, as is now the case with securities held by the accounts of customers registered in street name. These payments will be the responsibility of the Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear participant and not of Clearstream, Luxembourg, Euroclear, any Paying Agent, the note trustee or the issuing entity. None of the issuing entity, the note trustee, any underwriter nor any Paying Agent will have the responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records of DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear relating to or payments made by DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear on account of beneficial interests in the Global Note Certificates or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear relating to those beneficial interests. Transfers of Notes Represented by Global Note Certificates Transfers of any interests in notes represented by a Global Note Certificate within DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be effected in accordance with the customary rules and 133 Back to Contents operating procedures of the relevant clearing system. The laws in some States within the United States may require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer notes represented by a Global Note Certificate to such persons may depend upon the ability to exchange such notes for notes in definitive form. Similarly, because DTC can only act on behalf of participants in the DTC system who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a person having an interest in notes represented by a Global Note Certificate accepted by DTC to pledge such notes to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system or otherwise to take action in respect of such notes may depend upon the ability to exchange such notes for notes in definitive form. The ability of any holder of notes represented by a Global Note Certificate accepted by DTC to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer such notes may be impaired if the pro posed transferee of such notes is not eligible to hold such notes through a participant or indirect participant in the DTC system. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Note Certificates described in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, crossmarket transfers between DTC, on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected by the relevant clearing system in accordance with its rules and through action taken by the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent and any custodian with whom the relevant Global Note Certificates have been deposited (the  Series Custodian ). On or after the closing date for any series, transfers of notes of such series between participants in Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear and transfers of notes of such series between participants in DTC will generally have a settlement date three business days after the trade date (T+3). The customary arrangements for delivery versus payment will apply to such transfers. Cross-market transfers between participants in Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear and DTC participants will need to have an agreed settlement date between the parties to such transfer. Because there is no direct link between DTC, on the one hand, and Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear, on the other, transfers of interests in the relevant Global Note Certificate will be effected through the Registrar, the Principal Paying Agent and the Series Custodian receiving instructions (and, where appropriate, certification) from the transferor and arranging for delivery of the interests being transferred to the credit of the designated account for the transferee. In the case of cross-market transfers, settlement between Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg accountholders and DTC participants cannot be made on a delivery versus payment basis. The securities will be delivered on a free delivery basis and arrangements for payment must be made separately. DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear have each published rules and operating procedures designed to facilitate transfers of beneficial interests in Global Note Certificates among participants of DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or changed at any time. None of the issuing entity, any agent, the underwriters or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, or any person by whom any of the foregoing is controlled for the purposes of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg, Euroclear or their respective direct or indirect participants or accountholders of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations or for the sufficiency for any purpose of the arrangements described in this base prospectus. Individual Note Certificates Beneficial owners of notes will only be entitled to receive Individual Note Certificates if the notes become immediately due and repayable by reason of an Event of Default or DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the issuing entity that it is unwilling or unable to hold the Global Note Certificates or is unwilling or unable to continue as, or has ceased to be, a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, the issuing entity cannot appoint a successor within 90 days of such notification. In no event will Individual Note Certificates in bearer form be issued. Any Individual Note Certificate will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of $100,000 (or its equivalent in another currency). Any Individual Note Certificates will be registered in that name or those names as the Registrar shall be instructed by DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear, as applicable. It is expected that these instructions will be based upon directions received by DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear from their participants reflecting the ownership of BookEntry Interests. To the extent permitted by law, the issuing entity, the note trustee and any Paying Agent shall be entitled to treat the person in whose names any Individual Note Certificate is registered as the absolute owner 134 Back to Contents thereof. The paying agency and agent bank agreement contains provisions relating to the maintenance by a registrar of a register reflecting ownership of the notes and other provisions customary for a registered debt security. Any person receiving Individual Note Certificates will not be obligated to pay or otherwise bear the cost of any transfer tax or governmental charge or any cost or expense relating to insurance, postage, transportation or any similar charge in connection with the delivery of such Individual Note Certificates, which will be solely the responsibility of the issuing entity. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of any Individual Note Certificates. Transfer and Settlement of Repricing Notes Under a Market Repricing Agreement Any repricing notes issued on an issue date will initially be represented by a Global Note Certificate. Each Global Note Certificate will in turn be exchangeable for certificates in individual certificated form only in the circumstances described under  Individual Note Certificates  above. Three business days before the relevant repricing transfer date, the market repricing agent will deliver to Euroclear and/or Clearstream a written notice (such notice being a  Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Note Call Notice ) in respect of the relevant series and/or class of repricing notes which are represented by a Global Note Certificate deposited with, and registered in the name of The Bank of New York Depositary (Nominees) Limited as common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (the  Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Notes , and holders thereof, the  Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Noteholders ) each spe cifying, inter alia , the account details with Euroclear and/or Clearstream (as the case may be) of any purchaser of the Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Notes, on the relevant repricing transfer date, (each such person for the Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Notes being an  Incoming Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Noteholder ), and the Principal Amount Outstanding in respect of such series and/or class of repricing notes on the repricing transfer date in respect of the Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Notes (the  Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Transfer Price ). No further action will be required by the Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Noteholders in connection with the transfer of the Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Notes to the market repricing agent (as contemplated by the Euroclear/Clearstream Call Notice) and then from the market repricing agent to the Incoming Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Noteholders (as contemplated by the Euroclear/Clearstream Transfer Notice). To facilitate the transfer of interests in the repricing notes held through DTC (the  DTC Repricing Notes , and holders thereof, the  DTC Repricing Noteholders ) as part of the repricing transfer, the market repricing agent shall facilitate delivery and payment by and to DTC Repricing Noteholders on the relevant repricing transfer date. A market repricing agent in respect of a series and/or class of repricing notes shall (to the extent that any DTC Repricing Notes are held in global form) notify DTC no later than two business days prior to the applicable repricing transfer date of the Principal Amount Outstanding on the repricing transfer date of the DTC Repricing Notes, being the amount payable by the investors wishing to purchase the DTC Repricing Notes (the  DTC Repricing Transfer Price ) (the  Incoming DTC Repricing Noteholders ) on that repricing transfer date; the reset margin applicable to the DTC Repricing Notes after that repricing transfer date; and the next Reset Period (as defined in the Conditions) in respect of the DTC Repricing Notes. The market repricing agent will arrange delivery of the relevant DTC Repricing Notes to the Incoming DTC Repricing Noteholders on the applicable repricing transfer date (including, without limitation, specifying deta ils of the accounts of such Incoming DTC Repricing Noteholders to DTC). No further action will be required by the DTC Repricing Noteholders for the transfer of the DTC Repricing Notes to or for the account of the market repricing agent. Upon payment on the relevant repricing transfer date of the DTC Repricing Transfer Price by the Incoming DTC Repricing Noteholders, all rights in respect of the DTC Repricing Notes will be transferred to or for the account of the applicable Incoming DTC Repricing Noteholders. 135 Back to Contents TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES The following is the text of the terms and conditions which, subject to completion and as supplemented, amended and/or replaced in accordance with the provisions of the relevant series note trust deed supplement and as reflected in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, will be endorsed on each Note issued under the Programme in definitive form.

Except in certain circumstances, the note trust deed contains no such limitation on the powers of the holders of the Most Senior Class of notes then outstanding, the exercise of which will be binding on all Classes of notes, irrespective of the effect thereof on their interests. (b) Security As security for the payment of all monies payable in respect of the notes of a Series under the note trust deed and the relevant series note trust deed supplement (including the remuneration, expenses and any other claims of the Note Trustee and any receiver appointed under the note trust deed), the issuing entity will pursuant to the note trust deed, the series note trust deed supplement and the relevant series pledge agreement for each Series of notes create the following security (the  Security ) in favour of the Note Trustee for itself and on trust for, among others, the Noteholders of each Series: (i) an assignment by way of first fixed security of the issuing entitys right, title and interest in and to the relevant medium term note certificate to the extent not pledged in (vi) below; (ii) a sub-charge by way of first fixed security of all of the issuing entitys right, title and interest in the security interest created by the MTN issuing entity in favour of the security trustee in respect of the relevant medium term note certificate; (iii) an assignment by way of first fixed security to the Note Trustee as trustee for itself and on trust for the other Secured Creditors all of the Issuing Entitys right, title and interest in and to, and the entire benefit of, the Issuing Entity Master Framework Agreement, the Paying Agency and Agent Bank Agreement and the Issuing Entity Distribution Account Bank Agreement (and sums received or recoverable thereunder); (iv) an assignment by way of first fixed security of the issuing entitys right, title, interest and benefit in and to all monies credited to the Issuing Entity Distribution Account or to any bank or other account in which the issuing entity may at any time have any right, title, interest or benefit in respect of the relevant Series; (v) a first floating charge over the issuing entitys business and assets; and (vi) a pledge over the relevant medium term note certificate pursuant to a pledge agreement between the issuing entity and the note trustee. The Security is described in detail in the note trust deed, each series note trust deed supplement and each series pledge agreement. The order of priority in respect of liabilities of a particular series if the Security is enforced is as follows: (a) in no order of priority between them but in proportion to the respective amounts due, to pay fees which are due to any receiver appointed under the note trust deed and all amounts due for legal fees and other costs, charges, liabilities, expenses, losses, damages, proceedings, claims and demands which have been incurred by the note trustee under the Issuing Entity Related Documents and/or in enforcing or perfecting title to the security together with interest due on these amounts; (b) towards payment of amounts due and unpaid on the class A notes, to interest then to principal after, subject to item (m) below, having paid any amounts due to a swap counterparty, if applicable, under the terms of any class A swap agreement; 146 Back to Contents (c) towards payment of amounts due and unpaid on the class B notes, to interest then to principal after, subject to item (n) below, having paid any amounts due to a swap counterparty, if applicable, under the terms any class B swap agreement; (d) towards payment of amounts of interest due and unpaid under the terms of the Expenses Loan Agreement, if any; (e) towards payment of amounts due and unpaid on the class C notes, to interest then to principal after, subject to item (o) below, having paid any amounts due to a swap counterparty, if applicable under the terms of any class C swap agreement; (f) if the series is specified as having class D notes, towards payment of amounts due and unpaid on the class D notes, to interest then to principal after, subject to the item (p) below, having paid any amounts due to a swap counterparty, if applicable, under the terms of any class D swap agreement; (g) towards payment of amounts of interest due and unpaid under the terms of the Expenses Loan Agreement, if any; (h) towards repayment of amounts of principal then due and unpaid under the terms of the Expenses Loan Agreement, if any; (i) towards payment of any sums that the issuing entity must pay to any tax authority; (j) towards payment of any sums due to third parties under obligations incurred in the course of the issuing entitys business; (k) towards payment of the Deferred Subscription Price in respect of the medium term note certificate; (l) towards payment of any dividends due and unpaid to shareholders of the issuing entity; (m) towards payment of the amount equal to any termination payment due and payable to a swap counterparty, if applicable, pursuant to a class A swap agreement, where the class A swap agreement has been terminated as a result of a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default; (n) towards payment of the amount equal to any termination payment due and payable to a swap counterparty, if applicable, pursuant to a class B swap agreement where the class B swap agreement has been terminated as a result of a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default; (o) towards payment of the amount equal to any termination payment due and payable to a swap counterparty, if applicable, pursuant to a class C swap agreement where the class C swap agreement has been terminated as a result of a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default; (p) if the series is specified as having class D notes, towards payment of the amount equal to any termination payment due and payable to a swap counterparty, if applicable pursuant to a class D swap agreement where the class D swap agreement has been terminated as a result of a Swap Counterparty Swap Event of Default; and (q) in payment of the balance, if any, to the liquidator of the issuing entity. The security becomes enforceable when an Event of Default occurs. These events are described in condition number 10 below. If an Event of Default occurs, the redemption of notes will not necessarily be accelerated as described in condition number 7 below. Notwithstanding the order of priority in respect of liabilities of a particular series if the Security is enforced, as set out above, whether before or after the delivery of an Enforcement Notice amounts representing Excess Swap Collateral may be withdrawn from the Issuing Entity Distribution Account from time to time and returned to the Swap Counterparty in accordance with the relevant Swap Agreement and such sums are automatically released from the Security. 147 Back to Contents (4) Swap Agreements The issuing entity may enter into numerous Swap Agreements, as may be necessary, in respect of each series, the material terms of which are described under the heading The Swap Agreements in this base prospectus and in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. (5) Negative Covenants of the Issuing Entity If any note is outstanding, the issuing entity will not, unless it is permitted by the terms of the Issuing Entity Related Documents or by the written consent of the note trustee: (i) create or permit to subsist any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other security interest, including anything which amounts to any of these things under the laws of any jurisdiction, on the whole or any part of its present or future business, assets or revenues, including uncalled capital; (ii) carry on any business other than relating to the issue of the notes, as described in the base prospectus; in carrying on that business, the issuing entity will not engage in any activity or do anything at all except: (1) preserve, exercise or enforce any of its rights and perform and observe its obligations under the notes, the paying agency and agent bank agreement, the note trust deed, the Indemnity Agreement, each swap agreement, the medium term note certificate and the related purpose trust, the corporate services agreement, the programme dealer agreement, the relevant series subscription agreement, the relevant market repricing agreement, the Series Distribution Account Bank Agreement and any Bank Mandate  collectively called the  Issuing Entity Related Documents . (2) use, invest or dispose of any of its property or assets in the manner provided in or contemplated by the Issuing Entity Related Documents; or (3) perform any act incidental to or necessary in connection with (1) or (2) above. (iii) have any subsidiaries, subsidiary business, business of any other kind, employees, premises or interests in bank accounts other than the Issuing Entity Distribution Account unless the account is charged to the note trustee on acceptable terms; (iv) have any indebtedness, other than indebtedness permitted under the terms of its articles of association or any of the Issuing Entity Related Documents; (v) give any guarantee or indemnity for any obligation of any person; (vi) repurchase any shares of its capital stock or declare or pay any dividend or other distributions to its shareholders except as otherwise is permitted by law; (vii) consolidate with or merge with or into any person or liquidate or dissolve on a voluntary basis; (viii) be a member of any group of companies for the purposes of value added tax; (ix) waive or consent to the modification or waiver of any of the provisions of the Issuing Entity Related Documents without the prior written consent of the note trustee; or (x) offer to surrender to any company any amounts which are available for surrender by way of group relief. (6) Interest (a) Specific Provision: Floating Rate Sterling Notes This Condition 6(a) is applicable to the notes if the Specified Currency is sterling and the notes are issued as floating rate notes. Each Note bears interest at a floating rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date. Interest in respect of the notes is payable in arrear in sterling on each Interest Payment Date. 148 Back to Contents If there is a shortfall between the amounts received by the issuing entity from the swap counterparty or otherwise and the amount of interest due on any class of notes on that Interest Payment Date, that shortfall will be borne by each note in that class in a proportion equal to the proportion that the interest outstanding on the relevant note bears to the total amount of interest outstanding on all the notes of that class. This will be determined on the Interest Payment Date on which the shortfall arises. Payment of the shortfall will be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity, or, if earlier, the Final Redemption Date, from payments made to it from the swap counterparty or otherwise on that Interest Payment Date, to make the payment The shortfall will accrue interest at the rate described for each class of note below plus a margin of 2.0 per cent, per annum, and payment of that interest will also be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity to make the payment or, if earlier, on the Final Redemption Date.  Interest Payment Date  means the following dates: (i) during any period that is not a Regulated Amortisation Period, the First Interest Payment Date and each Regular Interest Payment Date (being the third Payment Date following the preceding Interest Payment Date (unless otherwise specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms)); and (ii) during an Amortisation Period, each Payment Date. Each period beginning on (and including) the Interest Commencement Date or any Interest Payment Date and ending on (but excluding) the next Interest Payment Date is herein called an  Interest Period ; provided, however, that with respect to an Interest Period that commences during any period that is not an Amortisation Period and ends during the Regulated or the Rapid Amortisation Period, such Interest Period will end on the originally scheduled Interest Payment Date (and for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of an Interest Period which commences on the Interest Payment Date which falls at the end of the Interest Period during which the Rapid Amortisation Period or a Rapid Amortisation Period or Regulated begins, the Interest Period shall end on the next Payment Date). The first interest payment will be made on the First Interest Payment Date in respect of the Interest Period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to the First Inte rest Payment Date. The Rate of Interest applicable to the notes (the  Rate of Interest ) for each Interest Period will be determined by the Agent Bank as the sum of the then Margin and LIBOR for the relevant Interest Period (or in the case of the first Interest Period, a linear interpolation of the LIBOR rates for such periods as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms). LIBOR shall be determined on the following basis: (i) on the Interest Commencement Date in respect of the first Interest Period and thereafter on each  Interest Determination Date , namely the first day of the Interest Period for which the rate will apply, the Agent Bank will determine the offered quotation to leading banks in the London interbank market, in respect of the first Interest Period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to (but excluding) the First Interest Payment Date, a linear interpolation of the rates for sterling deposits for such period as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms and for each Interest Period thereafter, for sterling deposits for the relevant Interest Period, by reference to the display designated as the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rates as quoted on the Moneyline Reuters Monitor as Moneyline Reuters Screen LIBOR01 or (1) such other page as may replace Moneyline Reuters Screen LIBOR01 on that service for the purposes of displaying such information or (2) if that service ceases to display such information, such page as displays such information on such service (or, if more than one, that one previously approved in writing by the Note Trustee in its absolute discretion) as may replace the Moneyline Reuters Monitor) as at or about 11.00 a.m. (London time) on that date (the  Screen Rate ); (ii) if on any Interest Determination Date the Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will: (A) request each Reference Bank to provide the Agent Bank with its offered quotation to leading banks in the London interbank market, in respect of the first Interest Period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to (but 149 Back to Contents excluding) the First Interest Payment Date, a linear interpolation of the rates for such periods as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms and for each Interest Period thereafter, for sterling deposits for the relevant Interest Period, as at approximately 11.00 a.m. (London time) on the Interest Determination Date in question and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time; and (B) determine the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards to four decimal places) of such quotations; (iii) if on any Interest Determination Date the Screen Rate is unavailable and two or three only of the Reference Banks provide offered quotations, LIBOR for the relevant Interest Period shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii) on the basis of the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards to four decimal places) of the offered quotations of those Reference Banks providing the offered quotations; and (iv) if fewer than two such quotations are provided by the Reference Banks as requested, the Agent Bank will determine the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards to four decimal places) of the rates quoted by major banks in London, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (London time) on the first day of the relevant Interest Period for loans in sterling to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time, provided that if the Agent Bank is unable to determine LIBOR in accordance with the above provisions in relation to any Interest Period, the Redemption Rate applicable to the notes in respect of such Interest Period. The Agent Bank will, as soon as practicable after the Interest Determination Date in relation to each Interest Period, calculate the amount of interest (the  Interest Amount ) payable in respect of the notes for such Interest Period. The Interest Amount in respect of the notes will be calculated by applying the relevant Rate of Interest for such Interest Period to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes during such Interest Period, multiplying by the relevant Day Count Fraction and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest penny (half a penny rounded upwards). (b) Specific Provisions: Floating Rate US Dollar Notes This Condition 6(b) is applicable to the notes if the Specified Currency is US dollars and the notes are designated as floating rate notes. Each Note bears interest at a floating rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date. Interest in respect of the notes is payable in arrear in US dollars on each Interest Payment Date. If there is a shortfall between the amounts received by the issuing entity from the swap counterparty or otherwise and the amount of interest due on any class of notes on that Interest Payment Date, that shortfall will be borne by each note in that class in a proportion equal to the proportion that the interest outstanding on the relevant note bears to the total amount of interest outstanding on all the notes of that class. This will be determined on the Interest Payment Date on which the shortfall arises. Payment of the shortfall will be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity, or, if earlier, the Final Redemption Date, from payments made to it from the swap counterparty or otherwise on that Interest Payment Date, to make the payment The shortfall will accrue interest at the rate described for each class of note below plus a margin of 2.0 per cent, per annum, and payment of that interest will also be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity to make the payment or, if earlier, on the Final Redemption Date. 150 Back to Contents  Interest Payment Date  means the following dates: (i) during any period that is not an Amortisation Period, the First Interest Payment Date and each Regular Interest Payment Date (being the third Payment Date following the preceding Interest Payment Date (unless otherwise specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms)); and (ii) during an Amortisation Period, each Payment Date. Each period beginning on (and including) the Interest Commencement Date or any Interest Payment Date and ending on (but excluding) the next Interest Payment Date is herein called an  Interest Period ; provided, however, that with respect to an Interest Period that commences during any period that is not an Amortisation Period and ends during the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, such Interest Period will end on the originally scheduled Interest Payment Date (and for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of an Interest Period which commences on the Interest Payment Date which falls at the end of the Interest Period during which the Rapid Amortisation Period or Regulated Amortisation Period or a Rapid Amortisation Period begins, the Interest Period shall end on the next Payment Date). The first interest payment will be made on the First Interest Payment Date in respect of the Interest Period from (and including) the Inte rest Commencement Date to the First Interest Payment Date. The Rate of Interest applicable to the notes for each Interest Period will be determined by the Agent Bank as the sum of the then Margin and LIBOR for the relevant interest period (or, in the case of the first Interest Period, a linear interpretation of the LIBOR rates for such periods as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms). LIBOR shall be determined on the following basis: (i) on each Quotation Date (as defined below) until the first Quotation Date during the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, the Agent Bank will determine the offered quotation to leading banks in the London interbank market  called LIBOR  for onemonth US dollar deposits or threemonth US dollar deposits (in accordance with the relevant Interest Period specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms). In the case of the first Interest Period the Agent Bank will determine LIBOR based upon the linear interpolation of LIBOR for US dollar deposits as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. On each Quotation Date during the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, the Agent Bank will determine the offered quotation to leading banks in the London interbank market for onemonth US dollar deposits. This will be determined by reference to the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rates display as quoted on the Bridge Reuters monitor as Reuters Screen LIBOR01. If the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 stops providing these quotations, the replacement service for the purposes of displaying this information will be used. If the replacement service stops displaying the information, any page showing this information will be used. If there is more than one service displaying the information, the one approved in writing by the Note Trustee in its sole discretion will be used. In each case above, the determination will be made as at or about 11.00 a.m. London time, on that date. These are called the  Screen Rates . A  Quotation Date  means the second London Business Day before the first day of an Interest Period. A  London Business Day  means a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business in London, England. 151 Back to Contents (ii) if, on any Quotation Date, a Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will: (A) request each Reference Bank to provide the Agent Bank with its offered quotation to leading banks in the London interbank market of the equivalent of that Screen Rate on that Quotation Date in an amount that represents a single transaction in that market at that time; and (B) determine the arithmetic mean rounded upwards to four decimal places, of those quotations; (iii) if, on any quotation date, the Screen Rate is unavailable and two or three only of the Reference Banks provide offered quotations, the Rate of Interest for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by those Reference Banks calculated in the manner described in (ii) above; (iv) if fewer than two Reference Banks provide quotations, the Agent Bank will determine (in its absolute discretion) the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards to four decimal places) of the leading rates quoted by major banks in London  selected by the Agent Bank at approximately 11.00 a.m. London time on the relevant Quotation Date  to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time, for loans in US dollars. The Agent Bank will, as soon as practicable after the Quotation Date in relation to each Interest Period, calculate the amount of interest (the  Interest Amount ) payable in respect of the notes for such Interest Period. The Interest Amount in respect of the notes will be calculated by applying the relevant Rate of Interest for such Interest Period to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes during such Interest Period and multiplying the product by the relevant Day Count Fraction and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest US dollar 0.01 (half of a cent being rounded upwards). (c) Specific Provision: Floating Rate Euro Notes This Condition 6(c) is applicable to the notes if the Specified Currency is euro and the notes are designated to be floating rate notes. Each Note bears interest at a floating rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date. Interest in respect of the notes is payable in arrear in euros on each Interest Payment Date. If there is a shortfall between the amounts received by the issuing entity from the swap counterparty or otherwise and the amount of interest due on any class of notes on that Interest Payment Date, that shortfall will be borne by each note in that class in a proportion equal to the proportion that the interest outstanding on the relevant note bears to the total amount of interest outstanding on all the notes of that class. This will be determined on the Interest Payment Date on which the shortfall arises. Payment of the shortfall will be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity, or, if earlier, the Final Redemption Date, from payments made to it from the swap counterparty or otherwise on that Interest Payment Date, to make the payment The shortfall will accrue interest at the rate described for each class of note below plus a margin of 2.0 per cent, per annum, and payment of that interest will also be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity to make the payment or, if earlier, on the Final Redemption Date.  Interest Payment Date  means the following dates: (i) during any period that is not an Amortisation Period, the First Interest Payment Date and each Regular Interest Payment Date (being the third Payment Date following the preceding Interest Payment Date (unless otherwise specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms)); and (ii) during an Amortisation Period, each Payment Date. 152 Back to Contents Each period beginning on (and including) the Interest Commencement Date or any Interest Payment Date and ending on (but excluding) the next Interest Payment Date is herein called an  Interest Period ; provided, however, that with respect to an Interest Period that commences during any period that is not an Amortisation Period and ends during the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, such Interest Period will end on the originally scheduled Interest Payment Date (and for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of an Interest Period which commences on the Interest Payment Date which falls at the end of the Interest Period during which the Rapid Amortisation Period or Regulated Amortisation Period begins, the Interest Period shall end on the next Payment Date). The first interest payment will be made on the First Interest Payment Date in respect of the Interest Period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to the First Interest Payment Date. The Rate of Interest applicable to the notes (the  Rate of Interest ) for each Interest Period will be determined by the Agent Bank as the sum of the then Margin and EURIBOR for the relevant Interest Period (or in the case of the first Interest Period, a linear interpolation of the EURIBOR rates for such periods as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms). EURIBOR shall be determined on the following basis: (i) on the second TARGET Settlement Day before the Interest Commencement Date in respect of the first Interest Period and thereafter on each  Interest Determination Date , namely 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the second TARGET Settlement Day before the first day of the Interest Period for which the rate will apply, the Agent Bank will determine the offered quotation to prime banks in the EuroZone interbank market, in respect of the first Interest Period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to (but excluding) the First Interest Payment Date, a linear interpolation of the rates for euro deposits for such period as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms and for each Interest Period thereafter, for euro deposits for the relevant Interest Period, by reference to (1) on the display page designated EURIBOR01 on the Dow Jones Reuters Service (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated by the Agent Bank as the information vendor, for the purpose of displaying comparable rates) as of the Interest Determination Date or (2) if that service ceases to display such information, such page as displays such information on such service (or, if more than one, that one previously approved in writing by the Note Trustee) as may replace the Dow Jones Reuters Monitor as at or about 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on that date (the  Screen Rate ); (ii) if, on any Interest Determination Date, the Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will: (A) request the principal eurozone office of each of four major banks in the EuroZone interbank market to provide a quotation of the rate at which deposits in euro are offered by it at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the EuroZone interbank market for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time; and (B) determine the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of such quotations; and (iii) if fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, the Agent Bank will determine the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, as aforesaid) of the rates quoted by major banks in the EuroZone interbank market, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date for loans in euro to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time, provided that if the Agent Bank is unable to determine EURIBOR in accordance with the above provisions in relation to any Interest Period, the Rate of Interest applicable to the notes during such Interest Period will be the sum of the then Margin and the EURIBOR last determined in relation to such notes in respect of a preceding Interest Period. 153 Back to Contents The Agent Bank will, as soon as practicable after the Interest Determination Date in relation to each Interest Period, calculate the amount of interest (the  Interest Amount ) payable in respect of the notes for such Interest Period. The Interest Amount in respect of the notes will be calculated by applying the relevant Rate of Interest for such Interest Period to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes during such Interest Period and multiplying the product by the relevant Day Count Fraction and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest euro 0.01 (half of a cent being rounded upwards). (d) Specific Provision: Fixed Rate Sterling Notes (Option 1) This Condition 6(d) is applicable to the notes if the Specified Currency is sterling and the notes are designated to be fixed rate notes (Option 1). Each Note bears interest on its Principal Amount Outstanding from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date. Interest in respect of the notes is payable in arrear in sterling on each Interest Payment Date. If there is a shortfall between the amounts received by the issuing entity from the swap counterparty or otherwise and the amount of interest due on any class of notes on that Interest Payment Date, that shortfall will be borne by each note in that class in a proportion equal to the proportion that the interest outstanding on the relevant note bears to the total amount of interest outstanding on all the notes of that class. This will be determined on the Interest Payment Date on which the shortfall arises. Payment of the shortfall will be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity, or, if earlier, the Final Redemption Date, from payments made to it from the swap counterparty or otherwise on that Interest Payment Date, to make the payment The shortfall will accrue interest at the rate described for each class of note below plus a margin of 2.0 per cent, per annum, and payment of that interest will also be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity to make the payment or, if earlier, on the Final Redemption Date.  Interest Payment Date  means the following dates: (i) during any period that is not an Amortisation Period, the First Interest Payment Date and each Regular Interest Payment Date (as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms); and (ii) during an Amortisation Period, each Payment Date. Each period beginning on (and including) the Interest Commencement Date or any Interest Payment Date and ending on (but excluding) the next Interest Payment Date is herein called an  Interest Period ; provided, however, that where the Floating Rate Commencement Date is a date falling prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date, with respect to an Interest Period that commences during the Revolving Period or the Controlled Accumulation Period and ends during the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, such Interest Period will end on, and exclude, the Floating Rate Commencement Date. Subject to the following paragraph, each Note bears interest at the Initial Rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding during the period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to, but excluding, the Floating Rate Commencement Date (the  Initial Period ). Interest in respect of the notes during the Initial Period is payable in arrear in sterling on each Regular Interest Payment Date and the final Interest Payment Date during the Initial Period shall be the earlier of the Scheduled Redemption Date or the Payment Date of the first month falling in the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period. The amount of the interest payable (the  Interest Amount ) in respect of the notes for any Interest Period during the Initial Period shall be calculated by applying the Initial Rate to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes, multiplying the resulting product by the relevant Day Count Fraction, and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest sterling 0.01 (half of a penny being rounded upwards). However, in the event that the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period has commenced, then from and including the Floating Rate Commencement Date to, but 154 Back to Contents excluding, the Final Redemption Date (the  Redemption Period ), each Note bears interest at a floating rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding to be determined in accordance with the provisions below, payable in arrear on each Payment Date. During the Redemption Period, each period beginning on, and including, a Payment Date to but excluding the next Payment Date is called an  Interest Period . The Rate of Interest applicable to the notes which are the subject of this Condition 6(d) (the  Redemption Rate ) for each Interest Period during the Redemption Period will be determined by the Agent Bank as the sum of the then Margin and LIBOR for the relevant Interest Period. LIBOR shall be determined on the following basis: (i) on the Floating Rate Commencement Date in respect of the first Interest Period during the Redemption Period and thereafter on each  Interest Determination Date , namely the first day of the Interest Period for which the Redemption Rate will apply, the Agent Bank will determine the offered quotation to leading banks in the London interbank market, for sterling deposits for the relevant Interest Period, by reference to the display designated as the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rates as quoted on the Moneyline Reuters Monitor as Moneyline Reuters Screen LIBOR01 or (1) such other page as may replace Moneyline Reuters Screen LIBOR01 on that service for the purposes of displaying such information or (2) if that service ceases to display such information, such page as displays such information on such service (or, if more than one, that one previously approved in writing by the Note Trustee) as may replace the Moneyline Reuters Monitor) as at or about 11.00 a.m. (London ti me) on that date, (the  Screen Rate ); (ii) if, on any Interest Determination Date, the Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will: (A) request each Reference Bank to provide the Agent Bank with its offered quotation to leading banks in the London interbank market, for sterling deposits for the relevant Interest Period, as at approximately 11.00 a.m. (London time) on the Interest Determination Date in question and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time; and (B) determine the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards to four decimal places) of such quotations; (iii) if, on any Interest Determination Date the Screen Rate is unavailable and two or three of the Reference Banks provide offered quotations, LIBOR for the relevant Interest Period shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii) on the basis of the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards to four decimal places) of the offered quotations of those Reference Banks providing the offered quotations; and (iv) if fewer than two such quotations are provided by the Reference Banks as requested, the Agent Bank will determine the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards to four decimal places) of the rates quoted by major banks in London, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (London time) on the first day of the relevant Interest Period for loans in sterling to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time, provided that if the Agent Bank is unable to determine LIBOR in accordance with the above provisions in relation to any Interest Period, the Redemption Rate applicable to the notes in respect of such Interest Period during the Redemption Period will be sum of the then Margin in respect of the notes and LIBOR last determined in relation to the notes in respect of the preceding Interest Period. During the Redemption Period, the Agent Bank will, as soon as practicable after the Interest Determination Date in relation to each Interest Period during the Redemption Period, calculate the amount of interest (the  Interest Amount ) payable in respect of the notes for such Interest Period. The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Redemption Rate for 155 Back to Contents such Interest Period to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes during such Interest Period and multiplying the product by the relevant Day Count Fraction, and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest sterling 0.01 (half of a penny being rounded upwards). (e) Specific Provision: Fixed Rate Dollar Notes (Option 1) This Condition 6(e) is applicable to the notes if the Specified Currency is US dollars and the notes are designated to be fixed rate notes (Option 1). Each Note bears interest on its Principal Amount Outstanding from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date. Interest in respect of the notes is payable in arrear in US dollars on each Interest Payment Date. If there is a shortfall between the amounts received by the issuing entity from the swap counterparty or otherwise and the amount of interest due on any class of notes on that Interest Payment Date, that shortfall will be borne by each note in that class in a proportion equal to the proportion that the interest outstanding on the relevant note bears to the total amount of interest outstanding on all the notes of that class. This will be determined on the Interest Payment Date on which the shortfall arises. Payment of the shortfall will be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity, or, if earlier, the Final Redemption Date, from payments made to it from the swap counterparty or otherwise on that Interest Payment Date, to make the payment The shortfall will accrue interest at the rate described for each class of note below plus a margin of 2.0 per cent, per annum, and payment of that interest will also be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity to make the payment or, if earlier, on the Final Redemption Date.  Interest Payment Date  means the following dates: (i) during any period that is not an Amortisation Period, the First Interest Payment Date and each Regular Interest Payment Date (as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms); and (ii) during an Amortisation Period, each Payment Date. (ii) Each period beginning on (and including) the Interest Commencement Date or any Interest Payment Date and ending on (but excluding) the next Interest Payment Date is herein called an  Interest Period ; provided however, that, where the Floating Rate Commencement Date is a date falling prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date, with respect to an Interest Period that commences during the Revolving Period or the Controlled Accumulation Period and ends during the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period, such Interest Period will end on, and exclude, the Floating Rate Commencement Date. Subject to the following paragraph, each Note bears interest at the Initial Rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding during the period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to, but excluding, the Floating Rate Commencement Date (the  Initial Period ). Interest in respect of such Note during the Initial Period is payable in arrear in US dollars on each Regular Interest Payment Date and the Final Interest Payment Date during the Initial Period shall be the Scheduled Redemption Date. The amount of the interest payable (the  Interest Amount ) in respect of the notes for any Interest Period during the Initial Period shall be calculated by applying the Initial Rate to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes, multiplying the resulting product by the relevant Day Count Fraction, and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest US dollar 0.01 (half of a cent being rounded upwards). However, in the event that the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period has commenced, then from and including the Floating Rate Commencement Date to, but excluding, the Final Redemption Date (the  Redemption Period ), each Note bears interest at a floating rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding to be determined in accordance with the provisions below, payable in arrear on each Payment Date. During the Redemption Period, each period beginning on, and including, a Payment Date to but excluding the next Payment Date is called an  Interest Period . 156 Back to Contents The Rate of Interest applicable to the notes which are the subject of this Condition 6(e) (the  Redemption Rate ) for each Interest Period during the Redemption Period will be determined by the Agent Bank as the sum of the then Margin and LIBOR for the relevant Interest Period. LIBOR shall be determined on the following basis: (i) on each Quotation Date during the Redemption Period, the Agent Bank will determine the offered quotation to leading banks in the London interbank market  called LIBOR  for onemonth US dollar deposits. This will be determined by reference to the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rates display as quoted on the Bridge Reuters monitor as Reuters Screen LIBOR01. If the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 stops providing these quotations, the replacement service for the purposes of displaying this information will be used. If the replacement service stops displaying the information, any page showing this information will be used. If there is more than one service displaying the information, the one approved in writing by the Note Trustee in its sole discretion will be used. In each case above, the determination will be made as at or about 11.00 a.m. London time, on that date. These are called the  Screen Rates . A  Quotation Date  means the second London Business Day before the Floating Rate Commencement Date in respect of the first Interest Period during the Redemption Period and thereafter the second London Business Day before the first day of an Interest Period. if, on any Quotation Date, a Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will: (ii) if, on any Quotation Date, a Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will: (1) request each Reference Bank to provide the Agent Bank with its offered quotation to leading banks of the equivalent of that Screen Rate on that Quotation Date in an amount that represents a single transaction in that market at that time; and (2) determine the arithmetic mean rounded upwards to four decimal places, of those quotations; (iii) if, on any Quotation Date, the Screen Rate is unavailable and only two or three of the Reference Banks provide offered quotations, LIBOR for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by those Reference Banks calculated in the manner described in (ii) above; and (iv) if fewer than two Reference Banks provide quotations, the Agent Bank will determine (in its absolute discretion) the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards to four decimal places) of the leading rates quoted by major banks in London  selected by the Agent Bank at approximately 11.00 a.m. London time on the relevant Quotation Date  to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time, for loans in US dollars. During the Redemption Period, the Agent Bank will, as soon as practicable after the Quotation Date in relation to each Interest Period during the Redemption Period, calculate the amount of interest (the  Interest Amount ) payable in respect of the notes for such Interest Period. The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Redemption Rate for such Interest Period to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes during such Interest Period and multiplying the product by the relevant Day Count Fraction, and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest US dollar 0.01 (half of a cent being rounded upwards). (f) Specific Provision: Fixed Rate Euro Notes (Option 1) This Condition 6(f) is applicable to the notes if the Specified Currency is euro and the notes are designated to be fixed rate notes (Option 1). 157 Back to Contents Each Note bears interest on its Principal Amount Outstanding from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date. Interest in respect of the notes is payable in arrear in euro on each Interest Payment Date. If there is a shortfall between the amounts received by the issuing entity from the swap counterparty or otherwise and the amount of interest due on any class of notes on that Interest Payment Date, that shortfall will be borne by each note in that class in a proportion equal to the proportion that the interest outstanding on the relevant note bears to the total amount of interest outstanding on all the notes of that class. This will be determined on the Interest Payment Date on which the shortfall arises. Payment of the shortfall will be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity, or, if earlier, the Final Redemption Date, from payments made to it from the swap counterparty or otherwise on that Interest Payment Date, to make the payment The shortfall will accrue interest at the rate described for each class of note below plus a margin of 2.0 per cent, per annum, and payment of that interest will also be deferred and will be due on the next Interest Payment Date on which funds are available to the issuing entity to make the payment or, if earlier, on the Final Redemption Date.  Interest Payment Date  means the following dates: (i) during any period that is not an Amortisation Period, the First Interest Payment Date and each Regular Interest Payment Date (as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms); and (ii) during an Amortisation Period, each Payment Date.

Subject to the following paragraph, each Note bears interest at the Initial Rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding during the period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to, but excluding, the Floating Rate Commencement Date (the  Initial Period ). Interest in respect of such Note during the Initial Period is payable in arrear in euro on each Regular Interest Payment Date and the Final Interest Payment Date during the Initial Period shall be the Scheduled Redemption Date. The amount of the interest payable (the  Interest Amount ) in respect of the notes for any Interest Period during the Initial Period shall be calculated by applying the Initial Rate to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes, multiplying the resulting product by the relevant Day Count Fraction, and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest euro 0.01 (half of a cent being rounded upwards). However, in the event that the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period has commenced, then from and including the Floating Rate Commencement Date to, but excluding, the Final Redemption Date (the  Redemption Period ), each Note bears interest at a floating rate on its Principal Amount Outstanding to be determined in accordance with the provisions below, payable in arrear on each Payment Date.

The Rate of Interest applicable to the notes which are the subject of this Condition 6(f) (the  Redemption Rate ) for each Interest Period during the Redemption Period will be determined by the Agent Bank as the sum of the then Margin and EURIBOR for the relevant Interest Period. 158 Back to Contents EURIBOR shall be determined on the following basis: (i) on the second TARGET Settlement Day before the Floating Rate Commencement Date in respect of the first Interest Period during the Redemption Period and thereafter on each  Interest Determination Date , namely 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the second TARGET Settlement Day before the first day of the Interest Period for which the rate will apply, the Agent Bank will determine the offered quotation to prime banks in the EuroZone interbank market for euro deposits for the relevant Interest Period, by reference to (1) on the display page designated EURIBOR01 on the Dow Jones Reuters Service (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated by the Agent Bank as the information vendor, for the purpose of displaying comparable rates) as of the Interest Determination Date or (2) if that service ceases to display such information, such page as displays such information on such service (or, if more than one, that one previously approved in writing by the Note Trustee) as may replace the Dow Jones Monitor as at or about 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on that date (the  Screen Rate ); (ii) if, on any Interest Determination Date, the Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will: (1) request the principal EuroZone office of each of four major banks in the EuroZone interbank market to provide a quotation of the rate at which deposits in euro are offered by it at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the eurozone interbank market for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time; and (2) determine the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of such quotations; and (iii) if fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, the Agent Bank will determine the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, as aforesaid) of the rates quoted by major banks in the EuroZone interbank market, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Determination Date for loans in euro to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time, provided that if the Agent Bank is unable to determine EURIBOR in accordance with the above provisions in relation to any Interest Period, the Redemption Rate applicable to the notes during such Interest Period will be the sum of the then Margin and EURIBOR last determined in relation to such notes in respect of the preceding Interest Period. During the Redemption Period, the Agent Bank will, as soon as practicable after the Interest Determination Date in relation to each Interest Period during the Redemption Period, calculate the amount of interest (the  Interest Amount ) payable in respect of the notes for such Interest Period. The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Redemption Rate for such Interest Period to the Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes during such Interest Period and multiplying the product by the relevant Day Count Fraction, and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest euro 0.01 (half of a cent being rounded upwards).

(a) Scheduled Redemption Class A notes: Unless previously purchased and cancelled or unless the Regulated Amortisation Period or Rapid Amortisation Period has already started, all class A notes will be redeemed on the relevant Series Scheduled Redemption Date, unless there is a shortfall between the amount in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account and the total amount payable to class A noteholders in sterling, if any, and to the swap counterparty under the class A swap agreement. If there is such a shortfall, the class A notes will be redeemed proportionately with the amount in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account after being exchanged under the terms of the class A swap agreement. The Rapid Amortisation Period will then begin. The payments will be made in no order of preference and proportionately between all class A notes. Class B notes: Unless previously purchased and cancelled or unless the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period has already started, the class B notes will be redeemed on the relevant Series Scheduled Redemption Date unless there is a shortfall between the amount in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account, after payment of all interest and principal due and payable on the class A notes, and the amount due and payable to the class B noteholders in sterling, if any, and to the swap counterparty under the class B swap agreement. If there is such a shortfall, the class B notes will be redeemed proportionately with the amount in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account after being exchanged under the terms of the class B swap agreement. The Rapid Amortisation Period will then begin. The payments will be made, in no order of preference and proportionately between all class B notes. 165 Back to Contents Class C notes: Unless previously purchased and cancelled or unless the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period has already started, the class C notes will be redeemed on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date unless there is a shortfall between the amount in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account, after payment of all interest and principal due and payable on the class A notes and the class B notes, and the amount due and payable to the class C noteholders in sterling, if any, and to the swap counterparty under the class C swap agreement. If there is such a shortfall, the class C notes will be redeemed proportionately with the amount in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account after being exchanged under the terms of the class C swap agreement. The Rapid Amortisation Period will then begin. The payments will be made, in no order of preference and proportionately between all class C notes. Class D notes: Unless previously purchased and cancelled or unless the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period has already started, the class D notes, if any, will be redeemed on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date unless there is a shortfall between the amount in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account, after payment of all interest and principal due and payable on the class A notes, the class B notes and the class C notes, and the amount due and payable to the class D noteholders in sterling, if any, and to the swap counterparty under the class D swap agreement. If there is such a shortfall, the class D notes will be redeemed proportionately with the amount in the Issuing Entity Distribution Account after being exchanged under the terms of the class D swap agreement. The Rapid Amortisation Period will then begin. The payments will be made, in no order of preference and proportionately between all class D notes. If the Rapid Amortisation Period begins as a result of there being insufficient funds to repay principal and pay interest on the class A notes, the class B notes, the class C notes or the class D notes, as described above, then on each Interest Payment Date after that, first the class A notes, second the class B notes, third the class C notes and fourth the class D notes, will be redeemed, to the extent of amounts available to the issuing entity, after being exchanged under the Swap Agreements, for each note of a class in the proportion that the principal amount outstanding of that note bears to the total Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes of that class. This will happen until the earlier of the time when each class of notes has been paid in full and the Interest Payment Date. On each Interest Payment Date, the agent bank will determine for each class of notes the following: (i) the amount of principal repayable on each note of that class; and (ii) the Principal Amount Outstanding of each note of that class on the first day of the next interest period, after deducting any principal payment due to be made on each note of that class on that Interest Payment Date. The amounts and dates determined by the agent bank will be notified to the issuing entity, the Paying Agents and the note trustee and published in accordance with condition number 15 as soon as possible after these parties have been notified. The issuing entity, the Paying Agents, the note trustee and the Noteholders will be bound by the determinations properly made as described above and neither the agent bank nor the note trustee will be liable for the exercise or nonexercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions for those purposes. If the agent bank fails to make a determination as described above, the note trustee will calculate the principal payment or Principal Amount Outstanding as described above, and each of these determinations or calculations will be deemed to have been made by the agent bank. If this happens, the determination will be deemed to have been made by the agent bank. (b) Mandatory Early Redemption or Mandatory Sale of Class B notes, Class C notes and Class D notes to the issuing entity 166 Back to Contents If the Regulated Amortisation Period or the Rapid Amortisation Period begins before the Series Scheduled Redemption Date, on each subsequent Interest Payment Date to such event each class A note will be redeemed, then each class B note will be redeemed, then each class C note will be redeemed and lastly each class D note will be redeemed, in the proportion that its Principal Amount Outstanding bears to the total Principal Amount Outstanding of the notes of that class, to the extent of the amount which is deposited into the Issuing Entity Distribution Account towards redemption of the medium term note certificate  after the amount has been exchanged for dollars, euro or other currency, as applicable, under the relevant swap agreement or by the note trustee in the spot exchange market if the relevant swap agreement has been terminated. This will happen until the earliest of: (i) the date on which the relevant class of notes has been redeemed in full; or (ii) the Final Redemption Date. (c) Optional Redemption The issuing entity may by not less than thirty and not more than sixty days prior notice to the trustee and without the need to obtain the prior consent of the note trustee or the Noteholders redeem all of the remaining notes on the next following Interest Payment Date together with all accrued interest, deferred interest and additional interest if any if the principal balance of the remaining notes is less than 10 per cent. of their original principal balance and the note trustee is satisfied that the issuing entity will have funds available to it to make the required payment on that Interest Payment Date. (d) Final Redemption If the notes have not previously been purchased and cancelled or redeemed in full as described in this condition number 7, the notes will be finally redeemed at their then Principal Amount Outstanding on the Final Redemption Date, together with, in each case, all accrued and unpaid interest, shortfall and interest on shortfall, if any. If, on the Final Redemption Date of a Note, the issuing entity is unable to pay all amounts then due under the relevant Class of notes having used all funds available to it in accordance with the applicable issuing entity priority of payments, the issuing entitys obligation to pay any amount left outstanding to the Noteholders under the relevant Class of notes and any claim that the Noteholders may have against the issuing entity in respect of such outstanding amounts will be extinguished. If there is a shortfall in interest, principal and/or fee payments then due and payable pursuant to the terms of a Class of Note, the issuing entity may not have sufficient funds to make payments on the relevant Class of Note and the Noteholders may incur a loss on interest, principal or other amounts which would otherwise be then due and payable on the relevant Class of notes. (e) Repricing Note Transfer (i) Any repricing notes shall be transferred in accordance with paragraph (ii) below on each related repricing transfer date prior to the occurrence of an repricing termination event, in exchange for payment of such Repricing Transfer Price and the issuing entity will procure payment of such Repricing Transfer Price to the applicable repricing noteholders on the relevant repricing transfer date provided that the issuing entity shall not be liable for the failure to make payment of the Repricing Transfer Price if such failure is a result of the failure of the market repricing agent to perform its obligations under the relevant transaction documents. (ii) Subject to paragraph (i) above, all the applicable repricing noteholders interests in the related repricing notes shall be transferred on the relevant repricing transfer date to the account of the Incoming Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Noteholders or Incoming DTC Repricing Noteholders. If definitive repricing notes have been issued, the applicable repricing notes will be registered in the names of the Incoming Euroclear/Clearstream Repricing Noteholders or Incoming DTC Repricing Noteholders on the repricing transfer date by the Registrar and the Register will be amended accordingly with effect from the relevant repricing transfer date. 167 Back to Contents (8) Payments Payments of principal and interest in respect of the notes will be made to the persons in whose names the Note Certificates are registered on the register at the opening of business in the place of the Registrars specified office on the fifteenth day before the due date for such payment. Such date is called the  Record Date . Payments will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, if the registered holder has provided wiring instructions no less than five Business Days prior to the Record Date, or otherwise by cheque mailed to the address of the registered holder as it appears in the register at the opening of business on the Record Date. In the case of the final redemption, and provided that payment is made in full, payment will only be made against surrender of those Note Certificates to the Registrar. The note trustee will not be responsible for any deficiency which may arise because it is liable to tax in respect of the proceeds of any security. Similar provisions in respect of the indemnification of the security trustee are set out in the transaction documents. (9) Taxation (a) Principal and Interest All payments of principal and interest in respect of the notes by or on behalf of the issuing entity shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or on behalf of Jersey, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction to whose tax laws such payments may be subject or any political subdivision therein or any authority in or of any of the foregoing having power to tax, unless the withholding or deduction of such taxes, duties, assessments, or governmental charges is required by law. In that event, the issuing entity or the Paying Agents shall make such payment after such withholding or deduction of such amounts has been made and shall account to the relevant authorities for the amount so required to be withheld or deducted. Neither the issuing entity nor the Paying A gents nor any other person will be required to make any additional payments to any Noteholder in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld as mentioned in this Condition 9. (b) General Tax Treatment of Notes Each holder of notes, by acceptance of such notes, agrees to treat the notes as indebtedness of the issuing entity and to report all income (or loss) in accordance with such treatment, and to take no action inconsistent with such treatment, except as otherwise required by any taxing authority under applicable law. (10) Events of Default If any of the following events occurs and is continuing it is called an  Event of Default : (i) the issuing entity fails to pay any amount of principal on the notes within 7 days of the date payment is due or fails to pay any amount of interest on the notes within 15 days of the date payment is due, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, a failure to make or procure any payment required under Condition 7(e) by reason of any failure on the part of the market repricing agent to perform its obligations under the relevant transaction documents shall not constitute a default in respect of the related repricing notes for the purposes of this Condition 10; or (ii) the issuing entity fails to perform or observe any of its other obligations under the notes, the note trust deed or the paying agency and agent bank agreement other than any obligation to pay any principal or interest on the notes, and, except where that failure is incapable of remedy, it remains unremedied for 30 days after the note trustee has given written notice of it to the issuing entity, certifying that the default is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders; or 168 Back to Contents (iii) the early termination, without replacement, of any of the Swap Agreements that are described in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms; or (iv) a judgment or order for the payment of any amount is given against the issuing entity and continues unsatisfied and unstayed for a period of 30 days after it is given or, if a later date is specified for payment, from that date; or (v) a secured party or encumbrancer takes possession or a receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, examiner, manager or other similar officer is appointed, of the whole or any part of the business, assets and revenues of the issuing entity or an enforcement action is begun for unpaid rent or execution is levied against any of the assets of the issuing entity; or (vi) the issuing entity becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (vii) an administrator or liquidator of the issuing entity or the whole or any part of the business, assets and revenues of the issuing entity is appointed, or an application for an appointment is made; or (viii) the issuing entity takes any action for a readjustment or deferment of any of its obligations or makes a general assignment or an arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors or declares a moratorium in respect of any of its indebtedness or any guarantee of indebtedness given by it; or (ix) the issuing entity stops or threatens to stop carrying on all or any substantial part of its business; or (x) an order is made or an effective resolution is passed for the winding up, liquidation or dissolution of the issuing entity; or (xi) any action, condition or thing at any time required to be taken, fulfilled or done in order: (1) to enable the issuing entity lawfully to enter into, exercise its rights and perform and comply with its obligations under and in respect of the notes and the Issuing Entity Related Documents; or (2) to ensure that those obligations are legal, valid, binding and enforceable, except as that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganisation or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors generally and that that enforceability may be limited by the effect of general principles of equity, is not taken, fulfilled or done; or (xii) it is or will become unlawful for the issuing entity to perform or comply with any of its obligations under or in respect of the notes or the related documents; or (xiii) all or any substantial part of the business, assets and revenues of the issuing entity is condemned, seized or otherwise appropriated by any person acting under the authority of any national, regional or local government; or (xiv) the issuing entity is prevented by any person acting under the authority of any national, regional or local government from exercising normal control over all or any substantial part of its business, assets and revenues. If an Event of Default occurs then the note trustee may give an Enforcement Notice or appoint a receiver if it chooses and if it is indemnified to its satisfaction. If an Event of Default occurs then the note trustee shall be bound to give an Enforcement Notice or appoint a Receiver if it is indemnified to its satisfaction and it is: (i) required to by the swap counterparty; (ii) required to by holders of at least one-quarter of the aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding of the class A notes, if any remain outstanding, and if none remain outstanding, the class B notes, 169 Back to Contents and if none of these remain outstanding, the class C notes, and if none of these remain outstanding, the class D notes; or (iii) directed by an extraordinary resolution, as defined in the note trust deed, of holders of outstanding class A notes, and if there are none, of holders of outstanding class B notes, and if there are none, of holders of outstanding class C notes, and if there are none, of holders of outstanding class D notes. An  Enforcement Notice  is a written notice to the issuing entity declaring the notes to be immediately due and payable. When it is given, the notes will become immediately due and payable at their Principal Amount Outstanding together with accrued interest without further action or formality. Notice of the receipt of an Enforcement Notice shall be given to the Noteholders as soon as possible. A declaration that the notes have become immediately due and payable will not, of itself, accelerate the timing or amount of redemption of the notes as described in condition number 7. (11) Prescription Your notes will become void if they are not presented within the time limit for payment. That time limit is ten years from their due date. If there is a delay in the Principal Paying Agent receiving the funds, the due date, for the purposes of this time limit, is the date on which it notifies you, in accordance with condition number 15, that it has received the relevant payment. (12) Replacement of Note Certificates If any Note Certificates are lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, you can replace them at the specified office of the Registrar. You will be required to both pay the expenses of producing a replacement and comply with the issuing entitys reasonable requests for evidence, security and indemnity. You must surrender any defaced or mutilated Note Certificates before replacements will be issued. (13) Note Trustee and Agents The note trustee is entitled to be indemnified and relieved from responsibility in certain circumstances and to be paid its costs and expenses in priority to your claims. In the exercise of its powers and discretions under the conditions and the note trust deed, the note trustee will consider the interests of the Noteholders as a class and will not be responsible for any consequence to you individually as a result of you being connected in any way with a particular territory or taxing jurisdiction. The note trust deed contains provisions requiring the Note Trustee to have regard to the interests of the Noteholders equally as a single Class as regards all rights, powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions of the Note Trustee (except where expressly provided otherwise) but where there is, in the Note Trustees opinion, a conflict among the interests of the Classes of Noteholders, the Note Trustee is required to have regard only to the interests of the holders of the Most Senior Class of notes then outstanding. In acting under the paying agency and agent bank agreement, and in connection with your notes, the Paying Agents, the exchange agent and the agent bank act only as agents of the issuing entity and the note trustee and do not assume any obligations towards or relationship of agency or trust for or with you. The note trustee and its related companies are entitled to enter into business transactions with the issuing entity, Barclays Bank PLC or related companies of either of them without accounting for any profit resulting from those transactions. The issuing entity can, at any time, vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent or the agent bank and can appoint successor or additional Paying Agents or a successor agent bank. If the issuing entity does this it must ensure that it maintains the following: (i) a Principal Paying Agent; (ii) a Paying Agent in New York and, if and for so long as any of the notes are listed on the United Kingdom Official List within the meaning of Part 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange, in London; 170 Back to Contents (iii) an agent bank; and (iv) a registrar. Notice of any change in the Paying Agents, agent bank, registrar or their specified offices shall be promptly given to you in accordance with condition number 15. (14) Meetings of Noteholders, Modification and Waiver, Substitution and Addition and Enforcement Meetings of Noteholders The note trust deed contains provisions for convening meetings of Noteholders of each Class or Sub-Class of any Series to consider matters relating to the notes of that Series, including the modification of any provision of these Conditions or the note trust deed. Any such modification may be made if sanctioned by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders of the relevant Class or Sub-Class. The note trust deed provides that: (a) an Extraordinary Resolution which in the opinion of the Note Trustee affects the notes of only one Class or Sub-Class shall be transacted at a separate meeting of the Noteholders of that Class or Sub-Class; (b) an Extraordinary Resolution which in the opinion of the Note Trustee affects the Noteholders of more than one Class or Sub-Class of notes but does not give rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Noteholders of one Class or Sub-Class of notes and the holders of another Class or Sub-Class of notes shall be transacted either at separate meetings of the Noteholders of each such Class or Sub-Class or at a single meeting of the Noteholders of all such Classes or Sub-Classes of notes as the Note Trustee shall determine in its absolute discretion; and (c) an Extraordinary Resolution which in the opinion of the Note Trustee affects the Noteholders of more than one Class or Sub-Class and gives rise to any actual or potential conflict of interest between the Noteholders of one Class or Sub-Class of notes and the Noteholders of any other Class or Sub-Class of notes shall be transacted at separate meetings of the Noteholders of each such Class or Sub-Class. The quorum for a meeting of a particular Class or Classes or Sub-Class or Sub-Classes of notes to vote on an Extraordinary Resolution, other than regarding a Basic Terms Modification, will be two or more Persons holding or representing a clear majority of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the outstanding notes in that Class or those Classes or Sub-Class or Sub-Classes or, at any adjourned meeting, two or more Persons being or representing Noteholders of that Class or those Classes or Sub-Class or Sub-Classes, whatever the Principal Amount Outstanding of the outstanding notes so held or represented in such Class or Classes or Sub-Class or Sub-Classes. The quorum for a meeting of a particular Class or Classes or Sub-Class or Sub-Classes of notes to vote on an Extraordinary Resolution relating to a Basic Terms Modification (which must be proposed separately to each Class or Sub-Class of Noteholders) will be two or more Persons holding or representing in the aggregate not less than 75 per cent. of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the outstanding notes in the relevant Class or Classes, Sub-Class or Sub-Classes or, at any adjourned meeting, two or more Persons holding or representing not less than in the aggregate 33? per cent. of the Principal Amount Outstanding of the outstanding notes in the relevant Class or Classes or Sub-Class or Sub-Classes. In relation to each Class or Sub-Class of notes: (a) no Extraordinary Resolution involving a Basic Terms Modification that is passed by the holders of one Class or Sub-Class of notes shall be effective unless it is sanctioned by an Extraordinary Resolution of the holders of each of the other Classes or Sub-Classes of notes (to the extent that there are outstanding notes in each such other Classes or Sub-Classes); (b) no Extraordinary Resolution to approve any matter other than a Basic Terms Modification of any Class or Sub-Class of notes shall be effective unless it is sanctioned 171 Back to Contents by an Extraordinary Resolution of the holders of each of the other Classes or Sub-Classes of notes ranking senior to such Class or Sub-Class (to the extent that there are outstanding notes ranking senior to such Class or Sub-Class) unless the Note Trustee considers that none of the holders of each of the other Classes of notes ranking senior to such Class or Sub-Class would be materially prejudiced by the absence of such sanction; and (c) any Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of Noteholders of one or more Classes or Sub-Classes of notes duly convened and held in accordance with the note trust deed shall be binding upon all Noteholders of such Class or Classes or Sub-Class or Sub-Classes, whether or not present at such meeting and whether or not voting and, except in the case of a meeting relating to a Basic Terms Modification, any Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of the holders of the Most Senior Class or Sub-Class of notes duly convened and held as aforesaid shall also be binding upon the holders of all the other Classes or Sub-Classes of notes. Modification and Waiver The note trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, (1) to any modification  except a Basic Terms Modification  of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, the notes or any other related agreement, which is not, in the opinion of the note trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Most Senior Class of notes or (2) to any modification of any of the provisions of the terms and conditions or any of the related agreements which, in the opinion of the note trustee, is of a formal, minor or technical nature or is to correct a manifest error or (3) to comply with any requirements of the SEC in order to effect and maintain the qualification of the note trust deed under the Trust Indenture Act. Any of those modifications, authorisations or waivers will be binding on the Noteholders and, unless the note trustee agrees otherwise, shall be promptly notified by the issuing entity to the Not eholders in accordance with condition number 15. Substitution and Addition The note trustee may also agree to the substitution of any other body corporate in place of the issuing entity as principal debtor under the note trust deed and the notes and in the case of such a substitution or addition the note trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, to a change of the law governing the notes and/or the note trust deed provided that such change would not in the opinion of the trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Most Senior Class of notes. Any such substitution or addition will be promptly notified to the Noteholders in accordance with condition number 15. Enforcement At any time after the notes become due and repayable and without prejudice to its rights of enforcement in relation to the security, the note trustee may, at its discretion and without notice, institute such proceedings as it thinks fit to enforce payment of the notes, including the right to repayment of the notes together with accrued interest thereon, and shall be bound to do so only if it has been so directed by an extraordinary resolution of the Noteholders of the relevant class and it has been indemnified to its satisfaction against all fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities which it may incur by so acting. No Noteholder may institute any proceedings against the issuing entity to enforce its rights under or in respect of the notes or the note trust deed unless (1) the note trustee has become bound to institute proceedings and has failed to do so within a reasonable time and (2) the failure is continuing. Notwithstanding the previous sentence and notwithstanding any other provision of the note trust deed, the right of any Noteholder to receive payment of principal of and interest on its notes on or after the due date for the principal or interest, or to institute suit for the enforcement of payment of that interest or principal, may not be impaired or affected without the consent of that Noteholder. (15) Notices Any notice to you will be deemed to have been validly given if published in a leading English language daily newspaper in London  which is expected to be the Financial Times  and will be deemed to have been given on the day it is first published. 172 Back to Contents Any notice specifying a Rate of Interest, an interest amount, an amount of shortfall or interest on it, principal payment or a Principal Amount Outstanding will be treated as having been duly given if the information contained in that notice appears on the relevant page of the Reuters Screen or other similar service approved by the note trustee and notified to you. The notice will be deemed given when it first appears on the screen. If it cannot be displayed in this way, it will be published as described in the previous paragraph. Copies of all notices given in accordance with these provisions will be sent to the London Stock Exchange Company Announcements Office, Clearstream, Luxembourg, Euroclear and DTC. (16) Currency Indemnity You can be indemnified against losses you suffer from the use of an exchange rate to convert sums recovered by you in litigation against the issuing entity, which is different to the rate you ordinarily use. You must request this indemnity in writing from the issuing entity. This indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the issuing entity and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action. (17) Limited Recourse Each of the Noteholders agrees with the issuing entity that notwithstanding any other provision of the transaction documents, all obligations of the issuing entity to the Noteholders, including its obligations under the notes and the transaction documents, are limited in recourse as set out below: (a) [it (and the security trustee on its behalf) will not be entitled to enforce its rights in respect of the Notes against any assets of the issuing entity other than those comprised in the Security]; and (b) upon the Note Trustee giving written notice to the Noteholders that it has determined in its sole opinion that there is no reasonable likelihood of there being any further realisations in respect of the Security (whether arising from an enforcement of the Security or otherwise) which would be available to pay amounts outstanding under the transaction documents and the notes, the Noteholders shall have no further claim against the issuing entity in respect of any such unpaid amounts and such unpaid amounts shall be discharged in full. (18) Governing Law and Jurisdiction The notes, any Swap Agreements and the note trust deed are governed by English law and the English courts have nonexclusive jurisdiction in connection with the notes. 173 Back to Contents THE SWAP AGREEMENTS General The issuing entity may enter into interest rate or currency swap agreements, the  Swap Agreements , with one or more swap counterparties for each class or sub class of notes. Under separate Swap Agreements for any such class or sub class requiring a swap, as the same may be amended and/or supplemented between the issuing entity and the swap counterparty, the issuing entity will (i) in respect of a currency swap agreement pay to the swap counterparty (a) on the relevant closing date certain initial principal payments in the currency in which such class or sub class is denominated and (b) thereafter sterling sums equal to the payments required under such currency swap agreement (unless such payments are deferred) and (c) on or prior to termination of the swap, certain final principal payments denominated in sterling and (ii) in respect of an interest rate swap agreement will pay to the swap counterparty after the relevant issue date sterling sums e qual to the payments required under such interest rate swap agreement. The significance percentage of the swap counterparty in respect of any swap agreement will be determined based on a reasonable good faith estimate of maximum probable exposure, made in substantially the same manner as that used in the sponsors internal risk management process in respect of similar instruments. The sponsors internal risk management process permits the posting of collateral by a swap counterparty to mitigate exposure under derivative instruments in certain circumstances pursuant to a credit support annex. Further details regarding the swap counterparty, the swap agreements and the credit support annex, if any, relating to a series or class of notes will be set out in the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms. 174 Back to Contents THE MEDIUM TERM NOTE CERTIFICATE On each closing date the MTN issuing entity will issue one interest bearing medium term note certificate to the issuing entity. The medium term note certificate will mature for redemption on the Series Scheduled Redemption Date. The Bank of New York in London will act as security trustee, depositary, issue agent and Principal Paying Agent in relation to the medium term note certificate. The medium term note certificates are issued in bearer form under a security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement. Under the terms of the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement, Barclays, acting through its corporate lending division at 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP, was appointed as cash manager for the medium term note certificates and certificates  called the  MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager . The medium term note certificates will be issued on a nonsyndicated continuous basis in series. Previously the MTN issuing entity issued the series 99-1 medium term note certificates (which were repaid in November 2002), the series 02-1 (which were repaid in October 2007), the series 03-1 (which were repaid in March 2008), the series 03-2 (which were repaid in June 2006), the series 03-3 (which were repaid in August 2006), the series 04-1 (which were repaid in February 2007), the series 04-2 (which were repaid in November 2007), the series 05-1, the series 05-2, the series 05-3 medium term notes, the series 05-4 medium term notes and the series 06-1 medium term notes. Medium term note certificates issued in respect of any series may differ as to principal, interest and recourse to security. Each series must be constituted by a supplemental deed to the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement. Each new series may differ from any other series in its principal terms and the manner, timing and amounts of distributions made to the holders of that series of medium term note certificates. The MTN issuing entity will not issue any further medium term note certificates in respect of an existing series without the prior consent of the holders of the existing medium term note certificates in that series, unless the further medium term note certificates are fungible with the existing ones. The medium term note certificates will be issued at par with a right of the MTN issuing entity to receive further payments of subscription price as deferred consideration, which we call  Deferred Subscription Price . The MTN issuing entity will pay an amount equal to the initial consideration received for the medium term note certificates to the receivables trustee for the purpose of the receivables trust which will permit the MTN issuing entity to acquire an undivided beneficial interest in the receivables trust. See  The Receivables Trust  and  Use of Proceeds . The initial principal amount of each undivided beneficial interest acquired is the initial investor interest for each class of Investor Certificates. These will be issued to the MTN issuing entity by the receivables trustee. See  Securitisation Cashflows: General . The ability of the MTN issuing entity to meet its obligations to pay principal of and interest on the medium term note certificate will be entirely dependent on the receipt by it of funds from the relevant Investor Certificates and Excess Interest attributable to the relevant series. The MTN issuing entity and the security trustee will have no recourse to Barclays other than: (i) against Barclaycard as originator under the Receivables Securitisation Agreement for any breach of representations and obligations in respect of the receivables; and (ii) against Barclaycard as MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager under the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement for any breach of obligations of the MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager. On the relevant closing date, the MTN issuing entity will declare an English law express purpose trust in respect of any funds received by it from each relevant Investor Certificate and Excess Interest attributable to each series. This trust will create a right in equity in favour of the holder of the medium term note certificate to require these funds to be applied in making payments on the medium term note certificate. The obligations of the MTN issuing entity and certain other rights of the MTN issuing entity under each series of medium term note certificates and under the documents relating to them, will be secured under the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement, by security interests over each relevant Investor Certificate. The security for each series will be granted by the MTN issuing entity 175 Back to Contents in favour of the security trustee. If the net proceeds of the enforcement of security for a series following a mandatory redemption  after meeting the expenses of the security trustee, the Paying Agents, the depository and any receiver  are insufficient to make all payments due on the medium term note certificates of that series, the assets of the MTN issuing entity securing other series of medium term note certificates will not be available for payment of that shortfall. If the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement is enforced, the monies paid to the MTN issuing entity by the receivables trustee on each Transfer Date will be applied: (i) first to meet payments due to any receiver appointed under it or to the security trustee and all amounts due for legal fees and other costs, charges, liabilities, expenses, losses, damages, proceedings, claims and demands which have been incurred under the Relevant Documents and in enforcing the security, together with interest due on these amounts; then (ii) to the extent not met above, to meet the costs, charges, liabilities, expenses, losses, damages, proceedings, claims and demands of the security trustee; then (iii) to meet payments of premium (if any), interest and principal on the relevant series of medium term note certificates; then (iv) to meet payments due by the MTN issuing entity to any taxation authority; then (v) to meet payment of sums due to third parties under obligations incurred in the course of the MTN issuing entitys business; then (vi) to meet payment of any dividends due and unpaid to shareholders of the MTN issuing entity; then (vii) to pay all amounts of MTN issuing entity additional interest payments (if any); (viii) to pay all amounts of Excess Entitlement Consideration; then (ix) to pay any balance to the liquidator of the MTN issuing entity. The interest rate on the medium term note certificate will be determined by the agent bank in accordance with the medium term note certificate conditions and as specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. The margin for the medium term note certificate will be the percentage specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms. The interest rate for the first interest period will be determined on the relevant closing date. Interest in respect of the medium term note certificate will be payable in arrear in sterling on each Interest Payment Date. Interest on the medium term note certificate will be paid monthly on each Distribution Date falling during or upon the expiry of each quarterly interest period. Excess Interest received by the MTN issuing entity under the Agreement Between Beneficiaries will be paid as MTN issuing entity additional interest payments on the medium term note certificate concurrently with the interest payments on the medium term note certificate. If any withholding or deduction for any taxes, duties, assessments or government charges is imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed on payments of principal or interest, including MTN issuing entity additional interest, on the medium term note certificate by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision or authority in or of any jurisdiction having power to tax, neither the MTN issuing entity nor the Principal Paying Agent will be required to make any additional payments to holders of the medium term note certificate for that withholding or deduction. The occurrence and continuation of the following events is called an MTN issuing entity Event of Default: (i) the MTN issuing entity fails to pay any amount of principal of the medium term note certificate within 7 days of the due date for its payment or fails to pay any amount of interest on the medium term note certificate within 15 days of its due date; or (ii) the MTN issuing entity fails to perform or observe any of its other obligations under the medium term note certificate, the MTN issuing entity supplement, or the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement and, except where the failure is incapable of remedy, it remains 176 Back to Contents unremedied for 30 days, in either case, after the security trustee has given written notice to the MTN issuing entity, certifying that the failure is, in the opinion of the security trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the medium term note certificate holders; or (iii) the early termination, without replacement, of any of the Swap Agreements as described in this base prospectus under  The Swap Agreements: Common Provisions of the Swap Agreements ; or (iv) a judgment or order for the payment of any amount is given against the MTN issuing entity and continues unsatisfied and unstayed for a period of 30 days after the date it is given or the date specified for payment, if later; or (v) a secured party takes possession or a receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, examiner, manager or other similar officer is appointed, of the whole or any part of the undertaking, assets and revenues of the MTN issuing entity or an enforcement action is begun for unpaid rent or executions levied against any of the assets of the MTN issuing entity; or (vi) the MTN issuing entity becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or an administrator or liquidator of the MTN issuing entity or the whole or any part of its business, assets and revenues is appointed, or application for any appointment is made, or the MTN issuing entity takes any action for a readjustment or deferment of any of its obligations or makes a general assignment or an arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors or declares a moratorium in respect of any of its indebtedness or any guarantee of indebtedness given by it or ceases or threatens to cease to carry on all or any substantial part of its business; or (vii) an order is made or an effective resolution is passed for the winding up, liquidation or dissolution of the MTN issuing entity; or (viii) any action, condition or thing at any time required to be taken, fulfilled or carried out in order to (i) enable the MTN issuing entity lawfully to enter into, exercise its rights and perform and comply with its obligations under and in respect of the medium term note certificates and the documents relating to them or (ii) to ensure that those obligations are legal, valid, binding and enforceable, except as the enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganisation or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors generally and as that enforceability may be limited by the effect of general principles of equity, is not taken, fulfilled or, as the case may be, carried out; or (ix) it is or will become unlawful for the MTN issuing entity to perform or comply with any of its obligations under or in respect of the medium term note certificates or the documents relating to them; or (x) all or any substantial part of the business, assets and revenues of the MTN issuing entity is condemned, seized or otherwise appropriated by any person acting under the authority of any national, regional or local government or the MTN issuing entity is prevented by any of these people from exercising normal control over all or any substantial part of its business assets and revenues. If an MTN issuing entity Event of Default occurs then the security trustee will be bound to give an Enforcement Notice if it is indemnified to its satisfaction and it is: (i) required to by holders of at least onequarter of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the medium term note certificate; or (ii) directed by an extraordinary resolution, as defined in the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement, of holders of the medium term note certificate. An MTN issuing entity Enforcement Notice is a written notice to the MTN issuing entity declaring the medium term note certificate to be immediately due and payable. When it is given, the medium term note certificate will become immediately due and payable at its principal amount outstanding together with accrued interest without further action or formality. Notice of the receipt of an MTN issuing entity Enforcement Notice shall be given to the holders of the medium term note certificate as soon as possible. A declaration that the medium term note certificate has become immediately due and payable will not, of itself, accelerate the timing or amount of redemption of the medium term note certificate. 177 Back to Contents When reference is made to the MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager it includes any successor to Barclays as MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager. The security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement provides that, as MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager, Barclays will service and administer the Distribution Account. Barclays, and any successor MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager to the MTN issuing entity, will be entitled to receive the fee inclusive of VAT, if any, for acting as MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager, payable by the MTN issuing entity from amounts received as MTN Issuing Entity Costs Amounts from the Distribution Account. The MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager may not resign, apart from in certain circumstances. The resignation of the MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager shall only become effective once a replacement has assumed all of the responsibilities of the MTN Issuing Entity Cash Manager set out in the security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement. The security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement also outlines the duties, rights and responsibilities of the security trustee. Specifically these include, but are not limited to: (i) the duty, if an Insolvency Event occurs, to, by written notice to the issuing entity declare all of the notes in respect of all series to be immediately repayable and the security to become enforceable and to appoint an administrative receiver; (ii) the maintenance of proper books of account in respect of its duties as trustee of the secured property in respect of each series; (iii) the duty of the security trustee, once the security has become enforceable, to act promptly to exercise its rights under any bank mandate relating to an Issuing Entity Distribution Account in respect of which it is a beneficiary of a trust declared over such account to prevent monies representing security property being paid from such account to an overdrawn account. The security trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of any secured creditor. The security trustee may resign at any time by providing the issuing entity with written notice. The secured creditors of all series may at any time by direction signed by all the secured creditors in writing addressed to the security trustee remove the security trustee. Upon such removal or resignation, the issuing entity shall be vested with the power to appoint a successor security trustee. Such removal or resignation shall not become effective until a successor trustee is appointed. The security trust deed and MTN cash management agreement is governed by English law. 178 Back to Contents MATERIAL LEGAL ISSUES Insolvency Act 2000 The U.K. Insolvency Act 2000 received Royal Assent on 30 November 2000. The Act amends Part I of the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986 so that the directors of a company which meets certain eligibility criteria can take steps to obtain a moratorium preventing any creditor from enforcing security or taking proceedings to recover its debt for the period in which the moratorium is in force. The relevant provisions of the Act came into force on 1 January 2003. However, prior to bringing the provisions into force, the Secretary of State of the United Kingdom amended the eligibility criteria by way of statutory instrument in such a way that special purpose vehicles such as the issuing entity and the MTN issuing entity can no longer be considered to be eligible companies. The Enterprise Act The U.K. Enterprise Act received Royal Assent on 7 November 2002 and came into force on 15 September 2003. Pursuant to the U.K. Enterprise Act, unless a floating charge was created prior to 15 September 2003, or falls within one of the exemptions contained in the U.K. Enterprise Act, the holder of a qualifying floating charge will be prohibited from appointing an administrative receiver to a company and consequently, the ability to prevent the appointment of an administrator to such company will be lost. A floating charge that the issuing entity will grant pursuant to the terms of the note trust deed and the series note trust deed supplement is a qualifying floating charge for the purposes of the U.K. Enterprise Act and will be entered into after 15 September 2003 and as such, unless excepted, the trustee will be prevented from appointing an administrative receiver in respect of the issuing entity and/or the MTN issuing entity. However, this qualifying floating charge will fall within the  Capital Market Arrangement  exception to the prohibition of the appointment of an administrative receiver and accordingly the trustee will still be able to appoint an administrative receiver pursuant to the note trust deed in respect of the issuing entity. 179 Back to Contents MATERIAL LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE RECEIVABLES Consumer Credit Act 1974 A significant number of the credit transactions that occur on a Designated Account will be for items of credit extended to a cardholder for an amount up to £25,000. The Consumer Credit Act applies to these transactions and, in whole or in part, the credit or charge card agreement establishing each Designated Account. This has certain consequences for the Designated Accounts, including the following: Enforcement of improperly executed or modified card agreements If a credit or charge card agreement has not been executed or modified in accordance with the Consumer Credit Act, it may be unenforceable against a cardholder without a court order  and in some instances may be completely unenforceable. As is common with many other U.K. credit and charge card issuing entities, some of Barclaycards credit and charge card agreements do not comply in all respects with the Consumer Credit Act or other related legislation. As a result, these agreements may be unenforceable by Barclaycard against the cardholders. The originator gives no guarantee that a court order could be obtained if required. With respect to those credit or charge card agreements which may not be compliant, such that a court order could not be obtained, Barclaycard estimates that this would apply to less than [] per cent. of the aggregate principal receivables in the Designated Accounts on 31 December 2007. Barclaycard does not anticipate any mate rial increase in this percentage of receivables in the Securitised Portfolio. In respect of those accounts that do not comply with the Consumer Credit Act it will still be possible to collect payments and seek arrears from cardholders who are falling behind with their payments. The originator will have no obligation to repay or account to a cardholder for any payments received by a cardholder because of this noncompliance with the Consumer Credit Act. However, if losses arise on these accounts, they will be written off and borne by the investor beneficiary and originator beneficiary based on their respective interests in the receivables trust. Liability for suppliers misrepresentation or breach of contract Transactions involving the use of a credit or charge card in the United Kingdom may constitute transactions under debtorcreditorsupplier agreements. A debtorcreditorsupplier agreement includes an agreement where the creditor, with knowledge of its purpose, advances funds to finance a purchase by the debtor of goods or services from a supplier. Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act provides that, if the supplier is in breach of the contract  whether such contract is express or implied by law  between the supplier and a cardholder in certain debtorcreditorsupplier agreements or if the supplier has made a misrepresentation about that contract, the creditor may also be liable to the cardholder for the breach or misrepresentation. The liability of the originator for a Designated Account is called a  Originator Section 75 Liability . In these circumstances, the cardholder may have the right to reduce the amount owed to the originator under his or her credit or charge card account. This right would survive the sale of the receivables to the receivables trustee. As a result, the receivables trustee may not receive payments from cardholders that it might otherwise expect to receive. As a result, the receivables trustee may not receive the full amount otherwise owed by a cardholder. However, the creditor will not be liable where the cash price of the item or service supplied concerning the claim is £100 or less, or greater than £30,000. The receivables trustee has agreed to indemnify the originator for any loss suffered by the originator arising from any claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This indemnity cannot exceed the original outstanding principal balance of the affected charges on the Designated Account. The receivables trustees indemnity will be payable from Available Funds on the receivables. Any amounts that Barclaycard recovers from the supplier will reduce Barclaycards loss for purposes of the receivables trustees indemnity. Barclaycard will have rights of indemnity against suppliers under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. Barclaycard may also be able to chargeback the transaction in dispute to the supplier under the operating regulations of VISA or MasterCard. If Barclaycards loss for purposes of the receivables trustees indemnity exceeds the Available Funds available to satisfy the loss, the amount of the excess will reduce the Originator Interest accordingly. 180 Back to Contents Transfer of Benefit of Receivables The transfer by the originator to the receivables trustee of the benefit of the receivables is governed by English law and takes effect in equity only. Notice to the cardholders of the assignment to the receivables trustee would perfect the legal title of the receivables trustee to the receivables. The receivables trustee has agreed that notice will not be given to cardholders, unless the originators longterm senior unsecured indebtedness as rated by Moodys or Standard & Poors were to fall below Baa2, BBB or BBB respectively. The lack of notice has several legal consequences. Until notice is given to the cardholders, each cardholder will discharge his or her obligations under the Designated Account by making payment to the originator. Notice to cardholders would mean that cardholders should no longer make payment to the originator as creditor under the card agreement but should instead make payment to the receivables trustee as assignee of the receivables. If notice is given, and a cardholder ignores it and makes payment to the originator for its own account, that cardholder would nevertheless still be bound to make payment to the receivables trustee. The originator, having transferred the benefit of the receivables to the receivables trustee, is the bare trustee of the receivables trustee for the purposes of the collection of the receivables that are the property of the receivables trust and is accountable to the receivables trustee accordingly. Before the insolvency of the originator, until notice is given to a cardholder who is a depositor or other creditor of the originator, equitable setoffs may accrue in favour of that cardholder against his or her obligation to make payments under the card agreement to the originator. These rights of setoff may result in the receivables trustee receiving less monies than anticipated from the receivables. The transfer of the benefit of receivables to the receivables trustee has been and will continue to be subject both to any prior equities that have arisen in favour of the cardholder and to any equities that may arise in the cardholders favour after the assignment. Where notice of the assignment is given to a cardholder, certain rights of setoff may not arise after the date of the notice. Under the terms of the Receivables Securitisation Agreement, the originator represents that each receivable assigned to the receivables trust is an Eligible Receivable  unless the receivable is specified as being an Ineligible Receivable. The eligibility criteria include that each receivable constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the cardholder enforceable  unless they are not in compliance with the Consumer Credit Act in which case they may only be enforceable with a court order and, in a small number of cases, may be unenforceable  against the cardholder in accordance with its terms. They also include that each receivable is not, save as specifically contemplated by any rule of English law, currently subject to any defence, dispute, set-off or counterclaim or enforcement orders apart from in the limited cases described in the previous sentence. Notice to the cardholder would perfect the transfer so that the receivables trustee would take priority over any interest of a later encumbrancer or transferee of the originators rights who has no notice of the transfer to the receivables trustee. Notice to the cardholder would prevent the card agreement from being amended by the originator or the cardholder without the consent of the receivables trustee. Lack of notice to the cardholder means that, for procedural purposes, the receivables trustee will have to join the originator as a party to any legal action that the receivables trustee may want to take against any cardholder. 181 Back to Contents UNITED KINGDOM TAXATION TREATMENT OF THE NOTES Overview The following summary is based on United Kingdom taxation law and H.M. Revenue & Customs practice in force at the date of this document and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Prospective investors should be aware that law and practice, and their interpretation by the courts, may change. The summary set out below describes certain United Kingdom tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the notes. The summary is subject to finalisation of documents relating to the programme and specifically to each Series; and is based on certain assumptions which cannot be verified with respect to any given Series before closing of that Series. The comments below are of a general nature based on United Kingdom law and practice at the date of this base prospectus and are subject to any change in law that may take effect after this date. The comments do not purport to be a complete analysis of all UK tax considerations of the notes and do not constitute legal or tax advice. They relate only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners (for English law purposes) of their notes and may not apply to certain classes of persons, including underwriters and persons who own the notes as trustee, nominee or otherwise on behalf of another person, but otherwise will, subject to the following paragraph, apply to United States holders who beneficially own the notes. The comments below do not necessarily apply where the interest or any other income on the notes is deemed for United Kingdom tax purposes to be the income of a person other than the absolute beneficial owner of the notes in question, for example where a person ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom transfers assets to a non resident company for the purpose of avoiding United Kingdom tax. Any Noteholders who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their professional advisers. In the following paragraphs,  HMRC  means HM Revenue and Customs, which is the central United Kingdom taxing authority. United Kingdom Withholding Tax The notes will constitute  Quoted Eurobonds  in those cases where they are listed on a recognised stock exchange and so long as they continue to be so listed. (Not all Series issued pursuant to this base prospectus will necessarily be so listed). Securities will be treated as listed on a recognised stock exchange if (and only if) they are admitted to trading on that exchange and either they are included in the United Kingdom official list (within the meaning of Part 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in accordance with the provisions of that part or they are officially listed, in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in European Economic Area states, in a country outside the United Kingdom in which there is a recognised stock exchange. The London Stock Exchange has been designated as a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Whilst the notes are and continue to be Quoted Eurobonds, payments of interest on the notes may be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of United Kingdom income tax irrespective of whether the notes are in global or definitive form. In all cases falling outside the exemption described above, interest on the notes may fall to be paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax at the savings rate, currently 20 per cent., subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. Provision of Information Holders should note that where any interest on notes is paid to them, or to any person acting on their behalf, by the issuing entity or any person in the United Kingdom acting on behalf of the issuing entity, called a  Paying Agent , or is received by any person in the United Kingdom acting on behalf of the relevant holder, other than solely by clearing or arranging the clearing of a cheque, called a  Collecting Agent , then the issuing entity, the Paying Agent or the Collecting Agent as the case may be, may in certain circumstances be required to supply to HMRC details of the payment and certain details relating to the holder, including the holders name and address. These provisions will apply whether or not the interest has been paid subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax and whether or not the holder is resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom taxation 182 Back to Contents purposes. The details provided to HMRC, in certain cases, may be passed by HMRC to the tax authorities of certain other jurisdictions. With effect from 6 April 2008 the provisions referred to above may also apply, in certain circumstances, to payments made on redemption of any notes where the amount payable on redemption is greater than the issue price of the notes. European Union Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income Under EU Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the  EU Savings Tax Directive ), each Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in that other Member State; however, for a transitional period, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg may instead apply a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at rates rising over time to 35%. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non EU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments. A number of non EU countries, and certain dependent or associated territories of certain Member States (including Jersey), have also agreed to adopt similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in a Member State. In addition, the Member States have entered into reciprocal provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made by a person in a Member State to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in one of those territories. Other Rules Relating to United Kingdom Withholding Tax 1. Where interest has been paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax, holders who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in any applicable double taxation treaty. 2. The references to  interest  above mean  interest  as understood in United Kingdom tax law. The statements above do not take any account of any different definitions of interest or principal which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions of the notes or any related documentation. 3. The above description of the United Kingdom withholding tax position assumes that there will be no substitution of the issuing entity and does not consider the tax consequences of any such substitution. 4. The notes may be issued at an issue price of less than 100 per cent. of their principal amount. Any discount element on any of these notes will not generally be subject to any United Kingdom withholding tax pursuant to the provisions mentioned above, but may be subject to reporting requirements as outlined above. 5. Where notes are to be, or may fall to be, redeemed at a premium, as opposed to being issued at a discount, then any such element of premium may constitute a payment of interest. Payments of interest are subject to United Kingdom withholding tax and reporting requirements as outlined above. United Kingdom Stamp Taxes No U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable on the issue of the global notes or on the issue of an individual note certificate. No UK stamp duty reserve tax is payable on the transfer of, or any agreement to transfer, a global note or an individual note certificate. No UK stamp duty is payable on an electronic transfer of a book entry interest in a global note, provided that such transfer is effected without the creation of any written document of transfer or any written agreement for transfer. Under current legislation, UK stamp duty may be payable on any document effecting or recording (i) a transfer of a global note or an individual note certificate, or (ii) a transfer or agreement to transfer an interest in a global note or individual note certificate. If draft legislation contained in Finance Bill 2008 is enacted without material amendment, the charges referred to in (i) and (ii) above may cease to apply as respects 183 Back to Contents any transfer of or agreement to transfer a global note or individual note certificate where the transfer or agreement in question is executed on or after the day on which Finance Act 2008 is passed. However, this new legislation will not apply if the notes do not meet certain conditions. UK Tax Overview for US Noteholders A US noteholder will not be considered to be resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes or otherwise subject to United Kingdom taxation on its income from the notes (other than tax withheld at source as discussed above) solely by reason of its holding of notes. UK Tax Overview for Noteholders within the Charge to UK Corporation Tax, Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax or Inheritance Tax Noteholders who are within the charge to UK corporation tax, income tax, capital gains tax or inheritance tax will generally be subject to tax in respect of their notes in accordance with the applicable legislation. Certain exemptions and reliefs may be available to certain categories of noteholders where all relevant conditions are satisfied. Taxation of the MTN Issuing Entity and the Issuing Entity The MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity will be liable to UK corporation tax at the maximum rate of currently 30 per cent (proposed to be reduced to 28% with effect from April 2008). So long as the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity respectively are within the application of the Taxation of Securitisation Companies Regulations 2006 (the  Regulations ), their taxable profits will in each case be limited to amounts their taxable profit will in each case be the greater of £1200 per annum or the aggregate of £600 per series outstanding during the course of the year. In order to fall within the application of the Regulations, a company must fulfil certain conditions, including ones which relate to its ongoing asset holdings (that the assets should be financial assets according to applicable accounting practice) and its ongoing cash flow management. These conditions are designed to ensure that the Regulations will apply to a company which is genuinely established and operated as a securitisation vehicle in a securitisation of money debts. So long as the cash flows of the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity continue to be managed in the same way as they have been to date, they can be expected as a factual matter to meet the relevant conditions. The Regulations have only been in force since the beginning of 2007 and the practices of the UK tax authorities in implementing the Regulations are still evolving. However, the UK tax authorities have worked very closely with the securitisation industry on developing the Regulations and related practices, and the Regulations are designed to allow genuine securitisation vehicle companies to be taxed on a basis which is compatible with market and rating requirements. Taxation of Receivables Trustee The receivables trustee will have no United Kingdom tax liabilities, and accordingly, the receivables trustee will have no liability to United Kingdom tax in relation to amounts which it receives on behalf of the MTN issuing entity or amounts which it is obliged to pay the MTN issuing entity. 184 Back to Contents MATERIAL JERSEY TAX CONSIDERATIONS Taxation of Issuing Entity and Receivables Trustee in Jersey The following summary of the anticipated tax treatment in Jersey of the issuing entity and Receives Trustee is based on Jersey taxation law and practice in force at the date of this document and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Prospective investors should consult their professional advisers on the implications of subscribing for, buying, holding, selling, redeeming or disposing of notes under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they may be liable to taxation. Prospective investors should be aware that tax rules and practice and their interpretation may change. The issuing entity and the Receivables Trustee have each been granted exempt company status within the meaning of Article 123A of the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended for the current calendar year. The effect of such special status is that the issuing entity and the Receivables Trustee are treated as a nonresident company for the purposes of Jersey tax laws and are therefore exempt from Jersey income tax on their profits arising outside Jersey (and, by concession, on bank deposit interest arising in Jersey) and from any obligation to withhold Jersey income tax from any interest or dividend payments made by them. Such status is applied for on an annual basis (together with payment of the required charge, currently £600). The retention of exempt company status is conditional upon the Comptroller of Income Tax in Jersey being satisfied that no Jersey resident has a beneficial interest in the issuing entity or Receivables Trustee, except as permitted by concessions granted by the Comptroller of Income Tax. As the issuing entity is an exempt company, payments in respect of the notes will not be subject to taxation in Jersey, no withholding will be required for or on account of Jersey income tax on such payments to any holder of a note and gains derived from the sale of notes will not be subject to Jersey income tax, in each case in the hands of persons not resident for income tax purposes in Jersey. As at the date of this Prospectus, Jersey has no capital gains tax and no inheritance tax or gift tax. No stamp duty or similar taxes are payable in Jersey in connection with the issue, redemption or sale of the notes. Jersey is not subject to the EU Savings Tax Directive. However, in keeping with Jerseys policy of constructive international engagement, the States of Jersey has introduced a retention tax system in respect of payments of interest, or other similar income, made to an individual beneficial owner resident in an EU Member State by a paying agent situate in Jersey (the terms beneficial owner and paying agent are defined in the EU Savings Tax Directive). The retention tax system will apply for a transitional period prior to the implementation of a system of automatic communication to EU Member States of information regarding such payments. The transitional period will end only after all EU Member States apply automatic exchange of information and the EU Member States unanimously agree that the United States of America has committed to exchange of information upon request. During this transitional period, such an individual beneficial owne r resident in an EU Member State will be entitled to request a paying agent not to retain tax from such payments but instead to apply a system by which the details of such payments are communicated to the tax authorities of the EU Member State in which the beneficial owner is resident. Under the implementation of the retention tax system in Jersey neither the issuing entity nor the Receivables Trustee will be obliged to levy retention tax in respect of interest payments made by it to a paying agent. European Union Code of Conduct on Business Taxation On 3 June 2003, the European Union Council of Economic and Finance Ministers reached political agreement on the adoption of a Code of Conduct on Business Taxation. Jersey is not a member of the European Union, however, the Policy & Resources Committee of the States of Jersey has announced that, in keeping with Jerseys policy of constructive international engagement, it intends to propose legislation to replace the Jersey exempt company regime by the beginning of 2009 with a general zero rate of corporate tax. 185 Back to Contents MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS Overview The following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax considerations of acquiring, holding and disposing of the notes that are offered for sale in the United States (the  U.S. offered notes ). This summary has been prepared and reviewed by Clifford Chance U.S. LLP  called  U.S. Tax Counsel . This summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal tax law. In particular, except as specifically indicated in this summary, it addresses only purchasers in the original offering that purchase U.S. offered notes at their original issue price and hold the U.S. offered notes as  Capital Assets  within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, called the  Code . It does not address special U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances or to certain types of investors subject to special tax rules  e.g. financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, taxexempt institutions, underwriters in securities or currencies, securities traders that elect marktomarket tax accounting, certain U.S. expatriates or investors holding the U.S. offered notes as part of a conversi on transaction, hedge, integrated transaction, constructive sale transaction or as a position in a straddle for tax purposes, or persons whose functional currency, as defined in Code Section 985, is not the U.S. dollar. Further, this discussion does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any tax considerations to holders of interests in a Noteholder. In addition, this summary does not discuss any foreign, state, local or other tax considerations. This summary is based on the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial authorities, all as in effect on the date of this base prospectus and all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. U.S. Tax Counsel has prepared and reviewed this summary of material U.S. federal income tax considerations, and is of the opinion that it is correct in all material respects. U.S. Tax Counsel also opines that, as described below, each of the receivables trust, the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income. U.S. Tax Counsel further opines that, as described below, although there is no directly governing authority addressing the classification of securities similar to the U.S. offered notes, under current law, the U.S. offered notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, U.S. Tax Counsel will render no other opinions about the acquisition, holding and disposition of the U.S. offered notes. Further, an opinion of U .S. Tax Counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and no ruling on any of the consequences or issues discussed below will be sought from the IRS. Moreover, there are no authorities on similar transactions involving securities issued by an entity with terms similar to those of the U.S. offered notes. Accordingly, the issuing entity suggests that persons considering the purchase of U.S. offered notes consult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the U.S. offered notes and the application of U.S. federal tax laws, as well as the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdictions, to their particular situations. For the purposes of this summary, a  United States Holder  means a beneficial owner of U.S. offered notes that is a  United States person  as described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, generally including: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created in or under the laws of the United States, any state or any political subdivision of any state  including the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate whose income is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes without regard to source; and (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons (as defined in the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 186 Back to Contents A  NonUnited States Holder  means a beneficial owner of U.S. offered notes (other than a partnership or an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes) that is not a United States Holder. If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the U.S. offered notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Tax Status of the Receivables Trust, the MTN Issuing Entity and the Issuing Entity It is presently contemplated that each of the receivables trust, the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity will conduct their respective activities, including activities undertaken on their behalf, such as servicing activities, entirely outside of the United States. In that regard, assuming that the activities of each of the receivables trust, the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity are, as contemplated, conducted entirely outside of the United States, and assuming each of these entities makes no investments that are subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax, U.S. Tax Counsel is of the opinion that, although no transaction closely comparable to that contemplated herein has been the subject of a Treasury regulation, revenue ruling or judicial decision and hence the matter cannot be free from doubt, each of the receivables trust, the MTN issuing entity and the issuing entity will not be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United S tates for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that each of these entities will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income. Prospective investors should understand that such determination of whether a person is engaged in a U.S. trade or business is based on a highly factual analysis, there is no direct guidance as to which activities constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, and it is unclear how a court would construe the existing indirect authorities. A foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as the branch profits tax, on its income which is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business. Such income tax, if imposed, would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a domestic corporation, except that a foreign corporation would be entitled to deductions and credits for a taxable year only if it files, on a timely basis, a U.S. federal income tax return for that year which none of the receivables trust, MTN issuing entity and issuing entity intend to do, even as a protective measure. The maximum U.S. federal income tax rates are currently 35 per cent. for a corporations effectively connected income and 30 per cent. for the branch profits tax, resulting in an effective maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 54.5 per cent. The branch profits tax is imposed each year on a corporations effectively connected earnings and profits, with certain adjustments, deemed repatriated out of the United States. United States Holders Tax Treatment of the U.S. Offered Notes . The applicable prospectus supplement/final terms will indicate whether the issuing entity will treat the U.S. offered notes as equity in the issuing entity or as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each holder of a note, by acceptance of such note, will agree to treat such note as either equity in the issuing entity or debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable. If the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms indicates that the issuing entity will treat one or more classes of U.S. offered notes as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then U.S. holders of such notes will be taxed in the manner below under the heading (see  Tax Treatment of U.S. Offered Notes as Equity ). If the applicable prospectus supplement/final terms indicates that the U.S. offered notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, although there is no authority addressing the characterisation of securities with terms similar to the U.S. offered notes under current law, and while not free from doubt, U.S. Tax Counsel will render an opinion that such notes will be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of U.S. Tax Counsel is not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the characterisation of the U.S. offered notes as debt would prevail if the issue were challenged by the IRS. Prospective United States Holders should consult with their tax advisers as to the effect of a recharacterisation of the U.S. offered notes as equity interests in the issuing entity. As discussed below, treatment of the U.S. offered notes as equity interests could have adverse tax consequences for United States Holders. 187 Back to Contents Except as indicated, the discussion below assumes the U.S. offered notes are treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest Payments and Distributions . The U.S. offered notes may be treated as having been issued with original issue discount   OID   for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case the OID will be taxed as described below. However, in the absence of any OID on the U.S. offered notes, interest on the U.S. offered notes will be taxable to a United States Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, in accordance with the holders regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The total amount of OID on a note is the excess of its stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price. The issue price for the U.S. offered notes is the price  including any accrued interest  at which a substantial portion of the relevant U.S. offered notes are first sold to the public. In general, the stated redemption price at maturity of a note is the sum of all payments made on the note other than payments of interest that (1) are payable at least annually over the entire life of the note and (2) are based on a single fixed rate or variable rate  or certain combinations of fixed and variable rates. If any of the U.S. offered notes are issued at a discount of an amount equal to or greater than 0.25 per cent. of that notes stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the notes weighted average maturity, called its  WAM , then that note will be deemed to bear OID. The WAM of a note is computed based on the number of full years each distribution of principal  or other amount included in the stated redemption price at maturity  is scheduled to be outstanding. Further, the IRS could take the position based on U.S. Treasury regulations that none of the interest payable on a note is unconditionally payable and so that all of that interest should be included in the notes stated redemption price at maturity. A United States Holder  including a cash basis holder  of a note deemed to bear OID generally would be required to accrue OID on the relevant note for U.S. federal income tax purposes on a constant yield basis. This would require the inclusion of OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income. Under Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code, special provisions apply to debt instruments on which payments may be accelerated due to prepayments of other obligations securing those debt instruments. However, no regulations have been issued interpreting those provisions, and the manner in which those provisions would apply to the U.S. offered notes is unclear. Foreign Currency Considerations : A United States Holder of a U.S. offered note that is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars (a  Foreign Currency ) that uses the cash method of accounting must include in income the U.S. dollar value of Foreign Currency interest paid when received. Foreign Currency interest received is translated at the U.S. dollar spot rate of the Foreign Currency on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt. A cash method United States Holder of a U.S. offered note will therefore generally not have exchange gain or loss on receipt of a Foreign Currency interest payment but may have exchange gain or loss upon disposing of the Foreign Currency received. A United States Holder of a U.S. offered note that uses the accrual method of accounting and a United States Holder of a U.S. offered note that bears OID, regardless of the method of accounting used, will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of Foreign Currency interest or OID, as the case may be, accrued during the accrual period. A United States Holder may determine the amount of income recognised with respect to such interest or OID using either of two methods. Under the first method, the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest or OID is translated at the average Foreign Currency rate for the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the partial period within the taxable year). A United States Holder of a U.S. offered note that uses this first method will therefore recognise exchange gain or loss, as the case may be, on interest or OID paid to the extent that the U.S. dollar/Foreign Currency ex change rate on the date the payment is received differs from the rate at which the income was accrued. Under the second method, the United States Holder can elect to accrue interest at the Foreign Currency spot rate on the last day of an accrual period or, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the receipt, the spot rate on the date of receipt. An election to accrue interest or OID at the spot rate will generally apply to all Foreign Currency denominated debt instruments held by the United States Holder, and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Regardless of the method used to accrue interest, a United States Holder may have additional exchange gain or loss upon a subsequent disposition of the Foreign Currency received. The amount realised on the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a U.S. offered note is determined by translating the Foreign Currency proceeds into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the 188 Back to Contents U.S. offered note is disposed of, while a United States Holders tax basis in a U.S. offered note will generally be the cost of the note to the United States Holder, determined by translating the Foreign Currency purchase price into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the U.S. offered note was purchased. A United States Holder will have a tax basis in Foreign Currency received on the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a U.S. offered note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the Foreign Currency on the date of receipt. Exchange gain or loss on a sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a U.S. offered note is recognised only to the extent of total gain or loss on the transaction. Foreign exchange gain or loss recognised by a United States Holder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a U.S. offered note (including repayment at maturity) will generally be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss in excess of exchange gain or loss on a U.S. offered note will generally be treated as U.S. source capital gain or loss. Non-corporate taxpayers may be subject to favourable tax rates with respect to their net long-term capital gains. Sourcing : Interest payments or distributions on a note generally will constitute foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain limitations, U.K. withholding tax, if any, imposed on these payments will generally be treated as foreign tax eligible for credit against a United States Holders U.S. federal income tax. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers concerning the foreign tax credit implications of the payment of any United Kingdom taxes. Disposition or Retirement of Investment . Subject to the discussion of the PFIC rules below and Foreign Currency considerations above, upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a note  including pursuant to a redemption by the issuing entity prior to its maturity date  a United States Holder will recognise gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realised and the United States Holders  Adjusted Tax Basis  in the relevant note. In general, a United States Holders Adjusted Tax Basis in an OID debt instrument is equal to the United States Holders cost for such debt instrument, plus any OID accrued and less the amount of any payments received by the holder that are not qualified stated interest payments under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. A United States Holders Adjusted Tax Basis in a debt instrument with no OID is generally equal to the holders cost less the amount of any principal payments made before the date of disposition. A United States Holders Adjusted Tax Basis in stock is generally equal to the United States Holders cost for the stock. In general, any gain or loss realised by the holder will be capital gain or loss. Under certain circumstances, capital gains derived by individuals are taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a United States Holders basis in a note includes accrued but unpaid OID, the holder may be required specifically to disclose any loss above certain thresholds under regulations on tax shelter transactions. Sourcing : Gain or loss realised by a United States Holder on the sale, exchange or retirement of a note generally will be treated as a United States source. Exceptions to the application of the sourcing provisions include exceptions for certain losses attributable to foreign exchange fluctuations, accrued but unpaid interest, and foreign offices of U.S. residents, among others. Some other exceptions to the general rule apply to U.S. offered notes treated as equity in the issuing entity. The issuing entity suggests that United States Holders consult their own tax advisors about the availability of and limitations on any foreign tax credit. Tax Treatment of U.S. Offered Notes as Equity . The applicable prospectus supplement/final terms will indicate whether the U.S. offered notes are treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company . Because of the nature of the income of the issuing entity, the issuing entity would constitute a passive foreign investment company  or  PFIC . Accordingly, United States Holders of any class of U.S. offered notes treated as equity would be shareholders in a PFIC. In general, United States Holders treated as shareholders of a PFIC would be subject to special tax rules on Excess Distributions made to them by the issuing entity, including a rateable inclusion of  Excess Distributions  in the United States Holders gross income as ordinary income taxable at the highest marginal rates applicable to current and prior years during the holding period (and not as qualified dividend income taxable at the longterm capital gain rates in the hands of noncorporate United States Holders) and requirement for the payment of an Interest Charge on tax that is deemed to have been deferred on these Excess Distributions. Excess distributions would generally include (1) certain distributions on a United States shareholders equity interest in the issuing entity for a taxable year, if the 189 Back to Contents total of those amounts exceeds 125 per cent. of the average amount of distributions from the issuing entity made during a specified base period, and (2) gain from the disposition, or deemed disposition, of the equity interest in the issuing entity. United States Holders generally might avoid these unfavourable consequences if they made either of two specific elections available under the Code with respect to shares in a PFIC, but it is uncertain whether either election would be available to a United States holder for the U.S. offered notes. The first such mitigating election is a  Qualified Electing Fund , or  QEF , election pursuant to Code Section 1295. If a United States Holder made a QEF election with respect to a note treated as equity, that United States Holder generally would be required to include its pro rata share of the issuing entitys ordinary income and net capital gains in income for each taxable year and pay tax on it, even if such income and gain were not distributed to the United States Holder. Further, any losses of the issuing entity would not be deductible by the United States Holder. If the issuing entity later distributed the income or gain on which a United States Holder had already paid tax, amounts so distributed would not be further taxable to the United States Holder. A United States Holders tax basis in such a note would be increased by the amount so included and decreased by the amount of nontaxable distributions there on. In general, a United States Holder making a QEF election would recognize, on a disposition of its U.S. offered notes, capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition and the tax basis in such U.S. offered notes. In general, a QEF election would be required to be made on or before the due date for filing a United States Holders U.S. federal income tax return for the first taxable year for which it holds a note. The QEF election would be effective only if certain required information were made available by the issuing entity to an investor. The issuing entity, however, does not intend to provide holders with this information and, accordingly, no assurance can be given to investors that any QEF election made with respect to U.S. offered notes would be effective. A United States Holder that held marketable stock in a PFIC might, in lieu of making a QEF election, also avoid certain unfavourable consequences of the PFIC rules by electing to mark the PFIC stock to market as of the close of each taxable year pursuant to code section 1296. A United States Holder that made the mark to market election would be required to include in income each year as ordinary income an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the stock at the close of the year over the United States Holders Adjusted Tax Basis in the stock. For this purpose, a United States Holders adjusted basis would generally be the holders cost for the stock, increased by the amount previously included in the holders income pursuant to this mark to market election and decreased by any amount previously allowed to the United States Holder as a deduction pursuant to this election. If, at the close of the year, the Uni ted States Holders Adjusted Tax Basis exceeded the fair market value of the stock, then the United States Holder could deduct any of this excess ordinary income, but only to the extent of net mark to market gains previously included in income. Any gain from the actual sale of the PFIC stock would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of net mark to market gains previously included in income. Stock would be considered marketable if it were regularly traded on an exchange that the IRS determined to be qualified for these purposes. Although the issuing entity believes that each class of U.S. offered notes will be listed on a qualified exchange, pursuant to U.S. Treasury regulations, a class of stock is regularly traded for any calendar year during which it is traded, other than in de minimis quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether any class of U.S. offered notes will be regula rly traded and hence, there can be no assurance  and no representation is made  that the U.S. offered notes would be eligible for the mark to market election. Because the issuing entity does not expect the QEF election to be available to an investor to mitigate the effect of the PFIC provisions, and it is unclear whether mark to market would be available either, United States Holders should be aware of the potentially adverse tax consequences arising under the PFIC provisions discussed above should any U.S. offered notes be treated as equity. First, an excess distribution (see   Investment in a Passive Foreign Investment Company  ) with respect to a Note would be taxable as though it had been earned rateably during the period in which the United States holder owned the note. Second, the amount deemed earned by the United States holder in prior tax years would be taxable at the highest rate of tax in effect for such tax years and the amount deemed earned in the current tax year would be taxable as ordinary income. Third, the United States holder would owe interest on the increases in tax as if the increases had been due in such years but had not been paid. Certain additional adverse consequences could flow to indirect investors in a PFIC. More specifically, the ownership of the U.S. offered notes by a NonUnited States Holder might be attributed to a United States Holder notwithstanding that such United States Holder held no note and received no cash in respect of a note. Code Section 1298(a) generally treats U.S. offered notes held directly or indirectly 190 Back to Contents by a foreign partnership, corporation (meeting certain ownership thresholds unless it is itself a PFIC), trust or estate as owned by such entitys partners, shareholders or beneficiaries, as applicable; it also may treat any of various option arrangements as conferring ownership of U.S. offered notes on United States Holders. Hence, a United States Holder treated as owning U.S. offered notes held by a NonUnited States Holder may be subject to tax on indirect gains and distributions attributable to the U.S. offered notes in the manner described above. Finally, an investor who pledged shares in a PFIC as security for a loan should be aware that such a pledge would be treated as a disposition of the related shares, and any gain would be subject to the rules applicable to distributions and gains with respect to shares in a PFIC described above. Foreign Currency Considerations : For purposes of calculating any deemed distribution of earnings of the issuing entity under the CFC or PFIC rules, the amount of such earnings is determined in the functional currency of the issuing entity, and translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the taxable year of the issuing entity. Amounts which are included in the income of the United States Holder upon receipt are translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt. United States Holders of U.S. offered notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may recognise foreign currency gain or loss attributable to movements in exchange rates between the times of deemed and actual distributions by the issuing entity. Any such currency gain or loss will be treated for as ordinary income from the same source as the associated income inclusion. Sourcing : For sourcing of payments for a note treated as stock in the issuing entity and gain or loss on sale of an interest in this stock, see   Interest Payments and Distributions  Sourcing  and   Disposition or Retirement of Investment  Sourcing  above. Controlled Foreign Corporation Status . Should the U.S. offered notes be treated as equity, it is possible that the issuing entity might be treated as a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In this event, United States Holders of equity interests that were treated as owning 10 per cent. or more of the combined voting power of the issuing entity would be required to include in income their pro rata share of the earnings and profits of the issuing entity, and generally would not be subject to the rules described above about PFICs. Additionally, an IRS Form 5471 may be required to be filed. Reporting Requirements . If any United States Holder were treated as owning an equity interest in the issuing entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be required file IRS Form 8621 for each tax year in which it held such an interest. In addition, if a United States Holder were treated as owning 5 per cent. or more of an equity interest of the issuing entity, certain additional reporting requirements would be required. Under Section 6038B of the Code  relating to reporting requirements incident to the transfer of property, including cash, to a foreign corporation by U.S. persons or entities  in general, a United States Holder, including a taxexempt entity, that purchased any U.S. offered notes treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be required to file an IRS Form 926 or similar form with the IRS if such United States Holder were treated as owning, directly or by attribution, immediately after the transfer at least 10 per cent. by vote or value of the issuing entity, or the purchase, when aggregated with all purchases made by such United States Holder  or any related person thereto  within the preceding 12 month period, exceeded $100,000. If a United States Holder fails to file any such required form, the United States Holder could be required to pay a penalty equal to 10 per cent. of the gross amount paid for the U.S. offered notes, subject to a maximum penalty of $100,000, or more in cases involving intentional disregard. Non-United States Holders Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, an investment in the U.S. offered notes by Non-United States Holders generally will not give rise to any U.S. federal income tax to these holders, unless the income received on, or any gain recognised on the sale or other disposition of their U.S. offered notes is: (i) treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or (ii) in the case of gain recognised by an individual, the individual is present in the United States for 183 days or more and certain conditions are met. 191 Back to Contents Non-United States Holders should consult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the U.S. offered notes. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Payments of principal and interest, as well as payments of proceeds from the sale, retirement or disposition of a note, may be subject to backup withholding tax under Section 3406 of the Code if a recipient of such payments fails to furnish to the payor certain identifying information. Any amounts deducted and withheld would be allowed as a credit against such recipients U.S. federal income tax, provided appropriate proof is provided under rules established by the IRS. Furthermore, certain penalties may be imposed by the IRS on a recipient of payments that is required to supply information but that does not do so in the proper manner. Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and financial institutions. Information may also be required to be provided to the IRS concerning payments, unless an exemption applies. Holders of the U.S. offered notes should consult their tax advis ors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and information reporting and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. 192 Back to Contents CERTAIN ERISA AND OTHER U.S. CONSIDERATIONS The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended  called  ERISA  and Section 4975 of the Code impose requirements on employee benefit plans and some other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans and certain collective investment funds, insurance company general or separate accounts or other entities in which these plans, accounts or arrangements are invested, that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. We call these entities  Plans . ERISA also imposes requirements on persons who are fiduciaries of Plans for the investment of plan assets of any Plan  called  Plan Assets . ERISA generally imposes on Plan fiduciaries certain general fiduciary requirements, including those of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that a Plans investmen ts be made in accordance with the documents governing the Plan. ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit a broad range of transactions involving Plan Assets and persons  called  Parties in Interest   who have specified relationships to a Plan or its Plan Assets, unless an exemption is available. Parties in Interest that participate in a prohibited transaction may be subject to a penalty imposed under ERISA or an excise tax imposed under Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. The details of these prohibited transaction rules are contained in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Subject to the considerations described below and unless otherwise stated in a Prospectus Supplement/Final Terms, you may purchase the notes with Plan Assets of any Plan. Any fiduciary or other Plan investor considering whether to purchase the notes with Plan Assets of any Plan should determine whether that purchase is consistent with its fiduciary duties and whether that purchase would constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code because any of Barclays Bank PLC, the issuing entity, the receivables trustee, the MTN issuing entity, the servicer, the note trustee, the security trustee or any other party may be or might become Parties in Interest with respect to the investing Plan and may be deemed to be benefiting from the issuance of the notes. If Barclays Bank PLC, the issuing entity, the receivables trustee, the MTN issuing entity, the servicer, the note trustee or the security trustee is a Party in Interest with respect to the prospective Plan investor, the issuing entity suggests that any fiduciary or other Plan investor considering whether to purchase or hold the notes consult with its counsel regarding the availability of exemptive relief under U.S. Department of Labor   DOL   Prohibited Transaction Class Exemptions, or any other prohibited transactions exemption issued by the DOL. A purchaser of the notes should be aware, however, that even if the conditions specified in one or more of the abovereferenced exemptions are met, the scope of the exemptive relief provided by the exemption might not cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. You will be deemed to have represented and agreed by your purchase and holding of the notes that (1) (a) no part of the funds being used to pay the purchase price for those notes constitutes Plan Assets of any Plan or will constitute Plan Assets while you hold those notes, and that you are not, and for so long as you hold the notes will not be, a Plan, or (b) the purchase and holding of such notes do not and will not constitute, result in or otherwise involve a nonexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; and (2) if, at any time while those notes are purchased or held by you, you are or will be another employee benefit plan subject to any U.S. Federal State or local or nonU.S. law substantially similar to Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the purchase and holding of those notes do not and will not violate any such substantially similar law. In addition, under DOL Regulation Section 2510.3101  called the  Plan Asset Regulation   the purchase with Plan Assets of equity interests in the issuing entity could, in certain circumstances, cause the medium term note certificate and other assets of the issuing entity to be deemed Plan Assets of the investing Plan which, in turn, would subject the issuing entity and its assets to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Thus, if the underlying assets of the issuing entity are deemed to be Plan Assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of Plan sponsors, Plan fiduciaries and Plan administrators, and of Parties in Interest, under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code (except to the extent (if any) that a favourable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies). In addition, various providers of fiduciary or other services to the issuing entity, and any other parties with authority or control with respect to the entity, could be deemed to be Plan fiduciaries or otherwise Parties in Interest by virtue of their provision of such 193 Back to Contents services (and there could be an improper delegation of authority to such providers). Nevertheless, consistent with the expectation indicated above that the issuing entity will proceed on the basis that the notes will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of U.S. Tax Counsel to that effect  see  Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations  United States Holders  Tax Treatment of the U.S. Offered Notes as Indebtedness , the issuing entity will proceed based on the position that the notes should not be treated as equity investments for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation and, therefore, the notes may be purchased by Plans. The issuing entitys position is also based, in part, upon the traditional debt features of the notes, including the reasonable expectation of purchasers of the notes that the notes will be repaid when due, as well as the absence of conversion rights, warrants and other typical equity features. The notes may not be purchased or held by any Plan, or any person investing Plan Assets of any Plan, if any of Barclays Bank PLC, the issuing entity, the receivables trustee, the MTN issuing entity, the servicer, the note trustee, security trustee or any of their respective affiliates (a) has investment or administrative discretion with respect to the Plan Assets used to effect the purchase; (b) has authority or responsibility to give, or regularly gives, investment advice with respect to the Plan Assets, for a fee and pursuant to an agreement or understanding that the advice (1) will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions for the Plan Assets and (2) will be based on the particular investment needs of that Plan; or (c) unless a Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption is applicable, is an employer maintaining or contributing to that Plan. Each purchaser or holder of the notes or any interest in the notes will be deemed to have represented by its purchase and holding of them that it is not subject to the foregoing limitation. Accordingly, the issuing entity suggests that prospective employee benefit plan investors, whether or not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, consult with their own legal and other advisors concerning the impact of ERISA and the Code and, particularly in the case of employee benefit plans not subject to ERISA, any additional U.S. state and local law or non-U.S. law considerations, as applicable. 194 Back to Contents ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS IN JERSEY OR ENGLAND AND WALES The MTN issuing entity is incorporated with limited liability in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985 and the issuing entity and the Receivables Trustee in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended. Any final and conclusive judgment of either a New York state or United States Federal court that has jurisdiction recognised by England and Wales regarding obligations of the issuing entity for the notes, which is for a debt or a fixed sum of money and which has not been stayed or fully satisfied, can be enforced by action against the issuing entity in the courts of England and Wales without reexamining the merits of the issues determined by the proceedings unless: (i) the proceedings in New York state or the United States Federal court involved a denial of the principles of natural justice; (ii) the judgment goes against the public policy of England and Wales; (iii) the judgment was obtained by fraud, duress or was based on a clear mistake of fact; (iv) the judgment is a penal or revenue judgment; or (v) there has been an earlier judgment in another court between the same parties on the same issues as are dealt within the judgment to be enforced. A judgment by a court may be sometimes given in pounds sterling. The issuing entity expressly submits to the jurisdiction of New York state and the United States Federal courts sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York for the purpose of any suit, action or proceedings arising out of this offering. The following parties have been appointed to receive legal documents for the issuing entity and the originator, servicer and trust cash manager. (i) for the issuing entity: CT Corporation Systems 111 Eighth Avenue New York, NY 10011 +1 212 590 9009 (ii) for the originator, servicer and trust cash manager: Office of the General Counsel Barclays Capital Inc. 200 Park Avenue New York, New York 10166 +1 212 412 1392 Most of the directors of the issuing entity and some of the experts named in this base prospectus live outside the United States. Additionally, some or all of the underwriters may be domiciled outside the United States. Most of their assets are located outside the United States. Because of this, the holders of the notes may not be able to effect service of process on them or to enforce judgments obtained in United States courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the Federal securities laws of the United States against them. The issuing entity has been advised by its English counsel, Clifford Chance LLP, and by its Jersey counsel, Bedell Cristin that because of this, the holders of the notes may not be able to enforce in England and Wales or Jersey, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, civil liabilities based on the Federal securities laws of the United States. 195 Back to Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION On [] the issuing entity entered into a programme dealer agreement with, among others, Barclays Bank PLC in its capacity as underwriter and arranger and Barclays Capital Inc. in its capacity as underwriter together with any other underwriter that may in the future become a party to the programme dealer agreement as provided therein in connection with the distribution of notes issued under the programme. The programme dealer agreement does not impose any obligation on the underwriters to purchase, or on the issuing entity to issue, any notes, but provides the general terms and conditions under which the issuing entity and one or more underwriters may agree to the issuance by the former and the purchase by the latter of one or more series of notes, in accordance with one or more series subscription agreements based on forms set out in the programme dealer agreement or such other form as may be agreed between the issuing entity and the relevant underwriter or underwriters. In addition, because the provisions of the programme dealer agreement are not exclusive, the issuing entity may offer and sell the notes in any of three ways: (i) directly to one or more purchasers; (ii) through agents; or (iii) through underwriters. Any underwriter or agent that offers the notes may be an affiliate of the issuing entity and/or Barclays, and offers and sales of notes may include secondary market transactions by these affiliates. These affiliates may act as principal or agent in secondary market transactions. Secondary market transactions will be made at prices related to prevailing market prices at the time of sale. A prospectus supplement/final terms in relation to this base prospectus will specify the terms of each offering, including: (i) the name or names of any underwriters or agents; (ii) the public offering or purchase price; (iii) the net proceeds to the issuing entity from the sale; (iv) any underwriting discounts and other items constituting underwriters compensation; (v) any discounts and commissions allowed or paid to underwriters; (vi) any commissions allowed or paid to agents; and (vii) the securities exchanges, if any, on which the notes will be listed. If any notes are sold through underwriters, the prospectus supplement/final terms will describe the nature of the obligation of the underwriters to purchase the notes. The notes may be offered to the public either through syndicates represented by one or more underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting alone. The underwriter or underwriters for a particular offering of notes will be named in the prospectus supplement/final terms relating to that offering, and, if a syndicate is used, the managing underwriter or underwriters will be set forth on the cover of the prospectus supplement/final terms. Unless otherwise described in the prospectus supplement/final terms, the obligation of the underwriters to purchase any notes will be subject to various conditions precedent. The prospectus supplement/final terms for any notes offered other than through underwriters will contain information regarding the nature of the offering and any agreements to be entered into between the issuing entity and the participants in the distribution of the notes. Underwriter trading may take place in some of the notes, including notes not listed on any securities exchange. Direct sales may be made on a national securities exchange or otherwise. If the issuing entity, directly or through agents, solicits offers to purchase notes, the issuing entity reserves the sole right to accept and, together with its agents, to reject in whole or in part any proposed purchase of notes. 196 Back to Contents The issuing entity may change any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to underwriters. If indicated in a prospectus supplement/final terms in relation to this base prospectus, the issuing entity will authorise underwriters or agents to solicit offers by certain institutions to purchase securities from the issuing entity pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery at a future date. Purchasers of notes, including underwriters, may, depending on the facts and circumstances of the purchases, be deemed to be Underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with reoffers and sales of the notes by them. Noteholders should consult with their legal advisors in this regard prior to any reoffer or sale. Underwriters and agents participating in the distribution of the securities, and their controlling persons, may engage in transactions with and perform services for the sponsor, the issuing entity or their affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Barclaycard will be the sponsor, originator beneficiary and servicer. United Kingdom Each underwriter has represented and agreed with the issuing entity that: (i) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, called the  FSMA  with respect to anything done by it in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and (ii) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated, and will only communicate or cause to be communicated, any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity  within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA  received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the notes, in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the issuing entity. Jersey The notes may not be: (i) offered to, sold to or purchased by persons resident for income tax purposes in Jersey other than financial institutions in the normal course of business; and (ii) transferred to a person resident for income tax purposes in Jersey (other than a financial institution in the normal course of business) unless the Registrar of the notes is satisfied that the beneficial owner thereof is not resident in Jersey for income tax purposes. Each underwriter has acknowledged its cognisance of the terms of the consent issued to the issuing entity pursuant to Article 5 of the Companies (General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002 (the  GPO Consent ) relating to the base prospectus and each prospectus supplement/final terms and their circulation and acknowledged that prior to the issuance of such GPO consent and compliance with its terms its has not been provided with any prospectus (as defined in any applicable securities legislation) or any similar document in connection with its subscription for the notes which has been approved or authorised for circulation by the issuing entity. Each underwriter has represented, warranted and agreed that: (i) it is not a resident of Jersey, Channel Islands for income tax purposes; (ii) it is financially sophisticated investor who is capable of evaluating the merits and risk of such investment and who has sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses which may result from such investment in the notes; and (iii) it will not knowingly transfer the notes to any person who is not a financially sophisticated investor capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such investment and who has sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses which may result from such investment in the notes or to any person it knows to be a resident of Jersey, Channel Islands for income tax purposes (other than a financial institution acting in the ordinary course of its business). 197 Back to Contents General The underwriters have represented and agreed that they have complied and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which they purchase, offer, sell or deliver notes or possess them or distribute the base prospectus and will obtain any consent, approval or permission required by them for the purchase, offer, sale or delivery by them of notes under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which they are subject or in which they make such purchases, offers, sales or deliveries and the issuing entity shall have no responsibility for them. Furthermore, they will not directly or indirectly offer, sell or deliver any notes or distribute or publish any prospectus, form of application, offering circular, advertisement or other offering material except under circumstances that will, to the best of their knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations, and all offers, sales and de liveries of notes by them will be made on the same terms. The underwriters have agreed that no invitation may be made to the public in Jersey to subscribe for the notes. Neither the issuing entity nor the underwriters represent that notes may at any time lawfully be sold in compliance with any application registration or other requirements in any jurisdiction, or pursuant to any exemption available thereunder, or assume any responsibility for facilitating such sale. With regard to each issue of notes, the underwriters will be required to comply with such other additional or modified restrictions, if any, as the issuing entity and the underwriters shall agree. The underwriters will, unless prohibited by applicable law, furnish to each person to whom they offer or sell notes a copy of the base prospectus and prospectus supplement/final terms as then amended or supplemented or, unless delivery of the prospectus is required by applicable law, inform each such person that copies will be made available upon request. The underwriters are not authorised to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the prospectus in connection with the offer and sale of notes to which the prospectus relates.

These sales will be made at prices relating to prevailing market prices at the time of sale. Neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays Capital Inc. has an obligation to make a market in the notes, and any marketmaking may be discontinued at any time without notice. For the avoidance of doubt, Barclays Capital is the same legal entity as Barclays Bank PLC. Barclays Bank PLC will be the initial originator, the servicer, the cash manager for the receivables trust and the medium term note certificate, the originator beneficiary and excess interest beneficiary and, if specified in the relevant prospectus supplement/final terms, the swap counterparty.

Rating agencies other than those requested could assign a rating to the notes, and their rating could be lower than any rating assigned by a rating agency chosen by the issuing entity. 199 Back to Contents LEGAL MATTERS Matters of English law relating to the validity of the issuance of the notes and certain matters of United Kingdom tax law relating to the notes will be passed upon for the issuing entity by Clifford Chance LLP, London, England.

Pursuant to Section 27 of the Articles of Association of the receivables trustee, every secretary, agent servant and employee of the receivables trustee shall be indemnified by the receivables trustee against the costs, charges, losses, liabilities, damages and expenses which any such person may incur in the course of the discharge by him of his duties as secretary, agent, servant or employee of the receivables trustee (as the case may be), provided that this indemnity shall not be applicable in circumstances where any such person has incurred such costs charges losses liabilities damages and expenses through his own fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence. In so far as the law allows every present or former officer of the receivables trustee shall be indemnified out of the assets of the receivables trustee against any loss or liability incurred by him by reason of being or having been such an officer.

Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules A list of exhibits filed herewith is contained in the Exhibit Index which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 17. Undertakings Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes: (a) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrants pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrants have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by a registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of such registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrants will, unless in the opinion of their counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by them is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (b) (1) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (c) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of a third party that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement in accordance with Item 1100(c)(1) of Regulation AB shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
