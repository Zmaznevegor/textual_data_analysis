The Company had no operations prior to the transactions on April 20, 2007. On December 22, 2006, KAR LLC entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire ADESA. The merger occurred on April 20, 2007. Concurrently with the merger, IAAI, a leading provider of automotive salvage auction and claims processing services in the United States, was contributed by affiliates of Kelso & Company and Parthenon Capital and IAAIs management to KAR Auction Services. Both ADESA and IAAI became wholly owned subsidiaries of KAR Auction Services, which was wholly-owned by KAR LLC prior to the initial public offering in December 2009. KAR Auction Services is the accounting acquirer, and the assets and liabilities of both ADESA and IAAI were recorded at fair value as of April 20, 2007. The following transactions occurred in connection with the merger:  Approximately 90.8 million shares of ADESAs outstanding common stock converted into the right to receive $27.85 per share in cash.  Approximately 3.4 million outstanding options to purchase shares of ADESAs common stock were cancelled in exchange for payments in cash of $27.85 per underlying share, less the applicable option exercise price, resulting in net proceeds to holders of $18.6 million.  Approximately 0.3 million outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units of ADESA vested immediately and were paid out in cash of $27.85 per unit.  Affiliates of the Equity Sponsors and management contributed to KAR Auction Services approximately $1.1 billion in equity, consisting of approximately $790.0 million in cash and ADESA stock and approximately $272.4 million of equity interest in IAAI.  KAR Auction Services entered into new senior secured credit facilities, comprised of a $1,565.0 million term loan facility and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility.  KAR Auction Services issued the Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes.  The net proceeds from the Equity Sponsors and financings were used to: (a) fund the cash consideration payable to ADESA stockholders, ADESA option holders and ADESA restricted stock and restricted stock unit holders under the merger agreement; (b) repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest under ADESAs then existing credit facility and notes; (c) repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest under IAAIs then existing credit facility and notes; (d) pay related transaction fees and expenses; and (e) contribute IAAIs equity at fair value. iv SUMMARY This summary highlights information about us and the Notes. This summary does not contain all of the information that you should consider before making your investment decision. You should carefully read the entire prospectus, including the matters discussed under the caption Risk Factors and in the financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this prospectus, as well as other information incorporated by reference into this prospectus. Our Company We are a leading provider of vehicle auction services in North America. We facilitate an efficient marketplace providing auction services for sellers of used, or whole car, vehicles and salvage vehicles through our 214 physical auction locations at December 31, 2009, and multiple proprietary Internet venues. In 2009, we facilitated the sale of over 3.3 million used and salvage vehicles. Our revenues are generated through auction fees from both vehicle buyers and sellers as well as by providing value-added ancillary services, including inspections, storage, transportation, reconditioning, salvage recovery, titling, and floorplan financing. We facilitate the transfer of ownership directly from seller to buyer and we do not take title or ownership to substantially all vehicles sold at our auctions. We currently have over 150,000 registered buyers at our auctions. ADESA, our whole car auction services business, is the second largest provider of used vehicle auction services in North America. Vehicles at ADESAs auctions are typically sold by commercial fleet operators, financial institutions, rental car companies, used vehicle dealers and vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies to franchised and independent used vehicle dealers. IAAI, our salvage auction services business, is one of the two largest providers of salvage auction services in North America. Vehicles at our salvage auctions are typically damaged or low value vehicles that are sold by automobile insurance companies, non-profit organizations, automobile dealers, vehicle leasing companies and rental car companies to licensed dismantlers, rebuilders, scrap dealers or qualified public buyers. An important component of ADESAs and, to a lesser extent, IAAIs services to its buyers is providing short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, primarily to independent used vehicle dealers through our wholly owned subsidiary, AFC. At March 31, 2010, we had a network of 62 whole car auction locations and 153 salvage auction locations. Our auction locations are primarily stand-alone facilities dedicated to either whole car or salvage auctions. Eleven of our locations are combination sites, which offer both whole car and salvage auction services. We believe our extensive geographic network and diverse product offerings enable us to leverage relationships with North American providers and buyers of used and salvage vehicles. 1 Summary Description of the Notes The summary below describes the principal terms of the Notes. Certain of the terms and conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. The Description of the Senior Notes section of this prospectus contains a more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the Senior Notes and the Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes section of this prospectus contains a more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Issuer KAR Auction Services, Inc. Notes Offered $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2014 $199,408,000 aggregate principal amount of 10% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 Maturity Dates The Floating Rate Senior Notes and Fixed Rate Senior Notes each mature on May 1, 2014 The Senior Subordinated Notes mature on May 1, 2015 Interest Payment Dates With respect to the Floating Rate Senior Notes, May 1, August 1, November 1 and February 1 of each year, having commenced August 1, 2007 With respect to the Fixed Rate Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes, May 1 and November 1 of each year, having commenced November 1, 2007 Guarantees The Floating Rate Senior Notes and Fixed Rate Senior Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally, on an unsecured unsubordinated basis by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees debt under our senior secured credit facility. The Senior Subordinated Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally, on an unsecured subordinated basis by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees debt under our senior secured credit facility. Ranking The Floating Rate Senior Notes and Fixed Rate Senior Notes and the respective guarantees thereof are our and the guarantors unsecured, senior obligations and rank in right of payment:  pari passu with all of our and the guarantors existing and future senior indebtedness, including any borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and the guarantees thereof; 2  senior to all of our and our guarantors existing and future subordinated indebtedness, including the Senior Subordinated Notes and the guarantees thereof; and  structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities, including trade and other payables, of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate amount of liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade and other payables, was $179.0 million. Because the Notes are unsecured, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up of our company or the guarantors or upon default in payment with respect to, or the acceleration of, any indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility or other secured indebtedness, the assets of our company and the guarantors that secure other secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations on the Notes and the guarantees only after all indebtedness under such other secured indebtedness has been repaid in full from such assets. See Description of Other Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2009, the Senior Notes would have been effectively subordinated to approximately $1,247.9 million of our and the guarantors secured debt and there would have been $250.0 million of additional availability under our senior secured credit facilities. The Senior Subordinated Notes and the guarantees thereof are our and the guarantors unsecured, senior subordinated obligations and rank in right of payment:  junior to all of our and the guarantors existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and the guarantees thereof and any borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and the guarantees thereof;  pari passu with all of our and our guarantors existing and future unsecured senior subordinated indebtedness; and  structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities, including trade and other payables, of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, the Senior Subordinated Notes would have been (i) subordinated to $1,847.9 million of our and the guarantors senior debt, including the Senior Notes, and there would have been $250.0 million of additional availability under our senior secured credit facilities and (ii) structurally subordinated to $179.0 million of liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade and other payables. 3 Optional Redemption We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the Floating Rate Senior Notes at the redemption prices listed under Description of the Senior NotesOptional RedemptionFloating Rate Senior Notes. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the Fixed Rate Senior Notes at the redemption prices listed under Description of the Senior NotesOptional RedemptionFixed Rate Senior Notes. We may, at our option, redeem some or all of the Senior Subordinated Notes at the redemption prices listed under Description of the Senior Subordinated NotesOptional Redemption. In addition, on or prior to May 1, 2010, we may, at our option, redeem up to 35% of each series of the Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price listed under Description of the Senior NotesOptional Redemption and Description of the Senior Subordinated NotesOptional Redemption. Mandatory Repurchase Offer If we experience specific types of changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant payment date. See Description of the Senior NotesRepurchase at the Option of Holders and Description of the Senior Subordinated NotesRepurchase at the Option of Holders. Certain Covenants The indentures governing the Notes among other things, restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:  incur additional debt;  pay dividends and make distributions;  make certain investments;  repurchase stock;  incur liens;  enter into transactions with affiliates;  merge or consolidate; and  transfer or sell assets. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.

Information About KAR Auction Services KAR Auction Services was incorporated in November 2006 and commenced operations in April 2007 upon the acquisition of ADESA and the consummation of transactions that resulted in ADESA and IAAI becoming, directly or indirectly, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. On November 3, 2009, we changed our name from KAR Holdings, Inc. to KAR Auction Services, Inc. ADESA entered the vehicle redistribution industry in 1989 and first became a public company in 1992. In 1994, ADESA acquired AFC, our floorplan financing business. ADESA remained a public company until 1995 when ALLETE purchased a majority of its outstanding equity interests. In June 2004, ALLETE sold 20% of ADESA to the public and then spun off their remaining 80% interest to shareholders in September 2004. ADESA was acquired by affiliates of the Equity Sponsors in April 2007. IAAI entered the vehicle salvage business in 1982, and first became a public company in 1991. After growing through a series of acquisitions, IAAI was acquired by affiliates of Kelso & Company and Parthenon Capital in 2005. Affiliates of Kelso & Company and Parthenon Capital and certain members of IAAI management contributed IAAI to KAR Auction Services in connection with the 2007 Transactions. On December 16, 2009, KAR Auction Services sold 25,000,000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering. In addition, on December 23, 2009, the underwriters of the initial public offering exercised a portion of their option to purchase additional shares, resulting in an additional 2,656,050 shares of common stock being sold by KAR Auction Services. Our principal executive offices are located at 13085 Hamilton Crossing Boulevard, Carmel, Indiana 46032, and our telephone number is (800) 923-3725. Our website is located at www.karauctionservices.com. The information on, or accessible through, the website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this prospectus. 5 RISK FACTORS Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider (1) the risk factors described below and those contained in the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus, including the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and (2) the other information included in this prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below or incorporated by reference herein will not occur. If they do, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to the Notes We have a substantial amount of debt, which could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and fulfill our obligations under the Notes. As of December 31, 2009, our total debt was approximately $2.3 billion and we had $250.0 million of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:  making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;  limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other purposes;  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes, including funding future expansion;  making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult to react quickly to, changing conditions; and  exposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our indebtedness, including a portion of the borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates. Restrictive covenants in agreements and instruments governing our debt, including the indentures governing the Notes, may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indentures governing the Notes and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contain, and future debt instruments may contain, various provisions that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, including ADESA and IAAI, to, among other things:  incur additional debt;  provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;  pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;  prepay, redeem or repurchase debt;  make loans, investments and capital expenditures; 6  incur liens;  pay dividends or make other payments by our restricted subsidiaries;  enter into certain transactions with affiliates;  sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries; and  consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person. Our senior secured credit facilities are secured, and our bank lenders and future secured creditors have a prior claim on our assets to the extent of the value of the collateral securing their claims. Similarly, holders of the guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness have a prior claim on the guarantors assets that secure such indebtedness. The Notes and the guarantees will not be secured by any of our assets. Holders of our secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of the guarantors will have claims that are prior to claims of holders of the Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. We and the guarantors, will be party to senior secured credit facilities, which will be secured by a significant portion of our assets, including a pledge of all of our capital stock and the capital stock of all of the direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries. In the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the secured indebtedness will have prior claim to our assets that constitute their collateral. Holders of the Notes will participate ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as the Notes. In that event, because the Notes and the guarantees will not be secured by any of our assets, it is possible that our remaining assets might be insufficient to satisfy claims in full. As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate amount of our senior secured indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, was approximately $1,247.9 million, and $250.0 million was available for additional borrowing under our senior secured credit facilities. We are permitted to borrow substantial additional secured indebtedness in the future under the terms of the indentures. If our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions, we will not be able to make payment on any of our debt, including the Notes. In addition, the structural subordination of the Notes to certain of our subsidiaries liabilities may limit our ability to make payment on the Notes. We are a holding company with no business operations, sources of income or assets other than ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Because all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries, our cash flow and the ability to make payments on our debt, including the Notes, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our subsidiaries. Some of our subsidiaries, including existing and future foreign subsidiaries, will not guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing or future liabilities and preferred equity of these subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to any such subsidiary, we, as a common equity owner of such subsidiary, and, therefore, holders of our debt, including holders of the Notes, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiarys creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred equity holders. As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate amount of liabilities of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes, including trade and other payables, was $179.0 million. Our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes represented approximately 15.4% of our total assets as of December 31, 2009 and approximately 20.3% of our total revenues, in each case before intercompany eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009. 7 If we default on obligations to pay our other indebtedness or otherwise fail to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes. Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our senior secured credit facilities that is not waived by the required lenders, could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our other indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In addition, the restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. A breach of any these financial, operating or other covenants could result in a default. In the event of any such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be due and payable and the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could elect to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we are unable to repay those amounts, such holders or lenders could institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. We require a significant amount of cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on and refinance debt, including the Notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, and our cash needs may increase. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to service our debt and meet other cash needs we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. We may not be able to take any of these actions. We may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms, if at all, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the restrictions imposed by the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the Notes on our ability to incur additional debt and use the proceeds from asset sales. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. The inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on our ability to meet obligations under the Notes. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we would be in default and, as a result:  our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;  the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and  we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in us losing our investment in the Notes. The right to receive payments on the Senior Subordinated Notes is junior to our existing indebtedness and possibly all of our future borrowings. Further, the guarantees of the Senior Subordinated Notes are junior to all of our guarantors existing indebtedness and possibly to all their future borrowings. The Senior Subordinated Notes and the guarantees thereof rank behind all of our and the guarantors existing indebtedness (other than trade payables) and all of our and the guarantors future borrowings (other than trade payables), except any future indebtedness that expressly provides that it ranks equal with, or subordinated in right of payment to, the Senior Subordinated Notes and the related subsidiary guarantees. As a result, upon any 8 distribution to our creditors or the creditors of the guarantors in a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or the guarantors or our or the guarantors property, the holders of our senior debt and that of the guarantors will be entitled to be paid in full and in cash before any payment may be made with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes or the guarantees thereof. In addition, all payments on the Senior Subordinated Notes and the guarantees thereof will be blocked in the event of a payment default on certain senior debt and may be blocked for up to 179 of 360 consecutive days in the event of certain non-payment defaults on certain senior debt. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or the guarantors, holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will participate with trade creditors and all other holders of our and the guarantors subordinated indebtedness in the assets remaining after we and the guarantors have paid all of our senior debt. However, because the indenture governing the Senior Subordinated Notes requires that amounts otherwise payable to holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding be paid to holders of senior debt instead, holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of trade payables in any such proceeding. In any of these cases, we and the guarantors may not have sufficient funds to pay all of our creditors and holders of Senior Subordinated Notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of our senior debt. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1,847.9 million of senior indebtedness, including the Notes, and $250.0 million was available for borrowing as additional senior debt under our senior secured credit facilities. We are permitted to borrow substantial additional indebtedness, including senior debt, in the future under the terms of the indentures. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indentures, subject to certain conditions, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The source of funds for that purchase of Notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries operations or other potential sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We cannot assure that sufficient funds from such sources will be available at the time of any change of control to make required repurchases of Notes tendered. Further, we may be contractually restricted under the terms of our senior secured credit facilities or other future senior indebtedness from repurchasing all of the Notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions and provisions. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase the Notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under our senior secured credit facilities and any such future debt agreements. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture and a cross-default under our senior secured credit facilities. In addition, certain corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a change of control under the indentures. Fraudulent transfer statutes may limit the rights of a holder of the Notes. Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:  void all or a portion of our obligations to holders of the Notes;  subordinate our obligations to holders of the Notes to our other existing and future indebtedness, entitling other creditors to be paid in full before any payment is made on the Notes; and  take other action detrimental to holders of the Notes, including invalidating the Notes. In that event, we cannot assure that the holder would ever be repaid. 9 Under federal and state fraudulent transfer laws, in order to take any of those actions, courts will typically need to find that, at the time the Notes were issued, we: (1) issued the Notes with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors; or (2) received less than fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring the indebtedness represented by the Notes; and (a) were insolvent or were rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes; (b) were engaged, or were about to engage, in a business or transaction for which our assets were unreasonably small; or (c) intended to incur, or believed or should have believed we would incur, debts beyond our ability to pay as such debts mature. Many of the foregoing terms are defined in or interpreted under those fraudulent transfer statutes. A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable guarantee. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A debtor will generally not be considered to have received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor. The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied in any such proceeding. Generally, a company would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred the debt:  the sum of its debts (including contingent liabilities) is greater than its assets, at fair valuation;  the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its total existing debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and matured; or  it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply in determining our solvency and whether it would conclude that we were solvent when we incurred our obligations under the Notes. Our obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, and the guarantees may also be subject to review under various laws for the protection of creditors. It is possible that creditors of the guarantors may challenge the guarantees as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. The analysis set forth above would generally apply, except that the guarantees could also be subject to the claim that, because the guarantees were incurred for the benefit of the issuer, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantors, the obligations of the guarantors thereunder were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. A court could void a guarantors obligation under its guarantee, subordinate the guarantee to the other indebtedness of a guarantor, direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a guarantee to the relevant guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of its creditors, or take other action detrimental to the holders of Notes. In addition, the liability of each guarantor under the indenture will be limited to the amount that will result in its guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution, and there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination as to what would be the maximum liability of each guarantor. 10 We do not know if a market will be sustained for the Notes. We have not and do not intend to apply for listing or quotation of any series of Notes on any securities exchange or stock market. The liquidity of any market for the Notes depends on a number of factors, including:  the number of holders of Notes;  our operating performance and financial condition;  the market for similar securities;  the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Notes; and  prevailing interest rates. 11 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and which are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties. In particular, statements made in this prospectus that are not historical facts (including, but not limited to, expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections regarding the industry, business, future operating results, potential acquisitions and anticipated cash requirements) may be forward-looking statements. Words such as should, may, will, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Such statements, including statements regarding our future growth; anticipated cost savings, revenue increases and capital expenditures; strategic initiatives, greenfields and acquisitions; our competitive position; and our continued investment in information technology are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results projected, expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Risk Factors. Some of these factors include:  fluctuations in consumer demand for and in the supply of used, leased and salvage vehicles and the resulting impact on auction sales volumes, conversion rates and loan transaction volumes;  trends in new and used vehicle sales and incentives, including wholesale used vehicle pricing;  the ability of consumers to lease or finance the purchase of new and/or used vehicles;  the ability to recover or collect from delinquent or bankrupt customers;  economic conditions including fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rate fluctuations;  trends in the vehicle remarketing industry;  changes in the volume of vehicle production, including capacity reductions at the major original equipment manufacturers;  the introduction of new competitors;  laws, regulations and industry standards, including changes in regulations governing the sale of used vehicles, the processing of salvage vehicles and commercial lending activities;  changes in the market value of vehicles auctioned, including changes in the actual cash value of salvage vehicles;  competitive pricing pressures;  costs associated with the acquisition of businesses or technologies;  litigation developments;  our ability to successfully implement our business strategies or realize expected cost savings and revenue enhancements;  our ability to develop and implement information systems responsive to customer needs;  business development activities, including acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses;  the costs of environmental compliance and/or the imposition of liabilities under environmental laws and regulations;  weather;  general business conditions;  our substantial amount of debt;  restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; 12  our assumption of the settlement risk for vehicles sold;  any impairment to our goodwill;  our self-insurance for certain risks;  any losses of key personnel;  interruptions to service from our workforce;  changes to accounting standards;  proposed tax legislation;  our tax indemnification of ALLETE; and  other risks described from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by us in 2010. Many of these risk factors are outside of our control, and as such, they involve risks which are not currently known that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed or implied herein. The forward-looking statements in this prospectus are made as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. Our future growth depends on a variety of factors, including our ability to increase vehicle sold volumes and loan transaction volumes, acquire additional auctions, manage expansion, relocate and integrate acquisitions, control costs in our operations, introduce fee increases, expand our product and service offerings including information systems development and retain our executive officers and key employees. Certain initiatives that management considers important to our long-term success include substantial capital investment in e-business, information technology, facility relocations and expansions, as well as operating initiatives designed to enhance overall efficiencies, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to yield any direct monetary benefits. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether our growth strategy will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict what portion of overall sales will be conducted through online auctions or other redistribution methods in the future and what impact this may have on our auction business. 13 USE OF PROCEEDS This prospectus is delivered in connection with offers and sales of notes by Goldman, Sachs & Co. in market-making transactions. We will not receive any proceeds from these transactions. 14 RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES The table below sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges on a historical basis for the periods indicated. The ratios below show the extent to which our business generates enough earnings after the payment of all expenses after interest to make required interest payments on our debt. For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income from continuing operations before taxes and fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest, whether expensed or capitalized, amortization of expenses related to indebtedness and an estimate of the interest within rental expense. KAR Auction Services, Inc. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 1.2x  (1)  (1) ADESA January 1, 2007 to April 19, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 6.1x 6.8x 6.2x (2) Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc.

(2) Fixed charges for 2005 include incremental interest expense compared to 2004 of $7.9 million incurred in the first half of 2005 resulting from ADESAs recapitalization and transition to an independent public company in 2005. (3) On February 22, 2005, IAAI entered into a merger agreement with Axle Merger Sub, Inc. and Axle Holdings, Inc. On May 25, 2005, Axle Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into IAAI, with IAAI continuing as the surviving corporation, and IAAI became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Axle Holdings, Inc., which was then wholly owned by Axle Holdings II, LLC. This merger and the related transactions resulted in additional debt and a new basis of accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for periods ending on or prior to May 25, 2005 generally are not comparable with the ratios for periods after that date. (4) The amount of deficiency was $8.9 million. (5) The amount of deficiency was $6.8 million. 15 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our consolidated capitalization as of December 31, 2009. You should read the data set forth in the table below in conjunction with the sections entitled Selected Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus. As of December 31, 2009 (in millions) Debt: Revolving credit facility (1)  Term loan B 1,247.9 Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 150.0 8 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2014 450.0 10% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (2) 425.0 Total debt 2,272.9 Total shareholders equity 1,141.5 Total capitalization $ 3,414.4 (1) Provides for up to $250.0 million of borrowings. See Description of Other IndebtednessSenior Secured Credit Facilities. (2) In January 2010, in connection with the closing of a cash tender offer for a portion of the Notes, we prepaid approximately $225.6 million principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes with proceeds received from our initial public offering of common stock (including the partial exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares). This amount was included in Current maturities of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. 16 DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS Senior Secured Credit Facilities Overview On April 20, 2007, we entered into a $1,865 million senior secured credit facility with Bear Stearns Corporate Lending Inc., as administrative agent, UBS Securities LLC, as syndication agent, and the lenders party thereto, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement has a six and one-half year term that expires on October 19, 2013. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement as of April 20, 2007, the lenders committed to provide advances and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $1,865 million, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used to finance working capital and acquisitions permitted under the Credit Agreement and for other corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement originally provided for a six and one-half year $1,565 million senior term loan, or the term loan, and a six-year $300 million senior revolving credit facility, or the revolving credit facility. The term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments at an amount of 0.25% of the initial term loan, with the remaining principal balance due on October 19, 2013. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $75 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until April 19, 2013, at which time all revolving amounts borrowed must be repaid. Amendment to Credit Agreement On October 23, 2009, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement. As part of the amendment, we paid an amendment fee of 25 basis points to approving lenders, based on commitments outstanding as of October 23, 2009, on the effective date of the amendment. The amendment became effective upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including the consummation of our initial public offering in December 2009 and the prepayment of $250 million of the term loan at the closing of our initial public offering on December 16, 2009. The amendment (i) permits KAR LLC to own less than 100% of KAR Auction Services outstanding capital stock, (ii) permits us to use proceeds from our initial public offering and any future offering of common stock plus unrestricted cash on hand at the time of our initial public offering to redeem, repurchase, defease, or otherwise repay one or more of the Senior Subordinated Notes, Fixed Rate Senior Notes and Floating Rate Senior Notes and (iii) allowed us to pay accelerated management fees to our Equity Sponsors in connection with the termination of our financial advisory agreements with them in December 2009. The following revisions also occurred in connection with the effectiveness of the amendment in December 2009:  availability of borrowings under the revolving credit facility were reduced by $50 million to $250 million;  the revolving credit facility and term loan interest rates were increased to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75% from LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%; and  the pricing grid in both facilities was eliminated. At December 31, 2009, $1247.9 million was outstanding on the term loan and there were no borrowings on the revolving credit facility. There were related outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $31.7 million at December 31, 2009, which reduce the amount available under the revolving credit facility. In addition, our Canadian operations have a C$4 million line of credit which was undrawn as of December 31, 2009. There were related letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately C$1.8 million at December 31, 2009, which reduce credit available under the Canadian line of credit, but do not impact amounts available under the revolving credit facility. We believe our sources of liquidity from our cash and cash equivalents on hand, working capital, cash provided by operating activities, and availability under our credit facilities are sufficient to meet our short and long-term operating needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, we believe the previously mentioned sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements and debt service payments for the next twelve months. 17 Prepayments The principal amount of the term loan amortizes in quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, with the balance payable at maturity. Subject to certain exceptions, our senior credit facilities are subject to mandatory prepayments and reduction in an amount equal to:  the net proceeds of (1) certain debt offerings by us or any of our subsidiaries, (2) certain asset sales by us or any of our subsidiaries (subject to customary reinvestment provisions), and (3) certain insurance recovery and condemnation events (subject to customary reinvestment provisions);  50% of excess cash flow subject to reduction based on our achievement of specified consolidated senior secured leverage ratio levels; and  50% of (i) net proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and (ii) specified securitization proceeds received by us or any of our subsidiaries (subject to customary reinvestment provisions) Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions are permitted, in whole or in part, in minimum amounts without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs. Security; Guarantees Our obligations under our senior credit facilities are guaranteed by each of our existing and certain future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. Our senior credit facilities and certain interest rate hedging agreements thereof, subject to certain exceptions, are secured on a first priority basis by (i) pledges of all the capital stock of all our direct or indirect material domestic subsidiaries and up to 65% of the capital stock of each of our direct foreign subsidiaries and (ii) liens on substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of us and the guarantors. Interest The revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 275 basis points. The revolving credit facility also provides for both overnight and swingline borrowings at a rate of prime plus a margin of 175 basis points. Our term loan facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 275 basis points. Fees Our fees with respect to our senior credit facilities include (i) fees on the unused commitments of the lenders under the revolving credit facility, (ii) letter of credit fees on the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit plus a fronting fee to the issuing bank and (iii) administration fees. Covenants The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, a financial covenant requiring a maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio be satisfied as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if revolving loans are outstanding, and covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, consummate change of control transactions, dispose of assets, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, make investments and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The leverage ratio covenant is based on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA which is EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for, among other things, (a) gains and losses from asset sales; (b) unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in respect of indebtedness; (c) certain 18 non-recurring gains and losses; (d) stock option expense; (e) certain other noncash amounts included in the determination of net income; (f) management, monitoring, consulting and advisory fees paid to the Equity Sponsors; (g) charges and revenue reductions resulting from purchase accounting; (h) unrealized gains and losses on hedge agreements; (i) minority interest expense; (j) expenses associated with the consolidation of salvage operations; (k) consulting expenses incurred for cost reduction, operational restructuring and business improvement efforts; (l) expenses realized upon the termination of employees and the termination or cancellation of leases, software licenses or other contracts in connection with the operational restructuring and business improvement efforts; (m) expenses incurred in connection with permitted acquisitions; and (n) any impairment charges or write-offs of intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA per the Credit Agreement adds the pro forma impact of recent acquisitions and the pro forma cost savings per the Credit Agreement to Adjusted EBITDA. The covenants contained within the Credit Agreement are critical to an investors understanding of our financial liquidity, as the violation of these covenants could result in a default and lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable. These covenants affect our operating flexibility by, among other things, restricting our ability to incur expenses and indebtedness that could be used to grow the business, as well as to fund general corporate purposes. We were in compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2009. Events of Default The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, failure to comply with covenants, inaccuracy of representation or warranties in any material respect, cross-default to certain other indebtedness, loss of lien perfection or priority, invalidity of guarantees, certain specified ERISA events, material judgments, change of control, and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. 19 DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES The Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the Floating Rate Senior Notes) were issued under an Indenture, dated as of April 20, 2007 (the Floating Rate Indenture), among the Company, our guarantor subsidiaries (as may be modified from time to time, the Guarantors) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the Floating Rate Trustee), as amended from time to time. The 8 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2014 (the Fixed Rate Senior Notes and, together with the Floating Rate Senior Notes, the Senior Notes) were issued under an Indenture, dated as of April 20, 2007 (the Fixed Rate Indenture and, together with the Floating Rate Indenture, the Indentures), among the Company, the Guarantors, the trustee, as amended from time to time. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Senior Notes include those stated in the Indentures and those made part of the Indentures by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The Floating Rate Senior Notes and the Fixed Rate Senior Notes were issued as a separate series and class and vote separately with respect to all matters. The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indentures, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Indentures, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Indentures because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Senior Notes. Brief Description of the Senior Notes The Senior Notes:  are general, unsubordinated obligations of the Company;  are unsecured;  are structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Companys Subsidiaries (other than Subsidiaries that are or become Subsidiary Guarantors pursuant to the provisions described below under Subsidiary Guarantees);  are limited to an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million for the Floating Rate Senior Notes and $450.0 million for the Fixed Rate Senior Notes, subject to our ability to issue Additional Notes;  mature on May 1, 2014;  bear interest at the applicable rate per annum shown from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for;  were issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 or, if greater at the Issue Date, the dollar equivalent of 1,000 rounded up to the nearest $1,000 (the Minimum Denomination) and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof;  are represented by one or more registered Senior Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by Senior Notes in definitive form. See Book Entry, Delivery and Form;  are pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company; and  are unconditionally guaranteed on an unsubordinated basis by each of the Companys current and future Subsidiaries that guarantees payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility. Because the Senior Notes are unsecured, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors or upon default in payment with respect to, or the acceleration of, any Indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility or other secured indebtedness, the assets 20 of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors that secure other secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations on the Senior Notes and the Guarantees only after all Indebtedness under such other secured indebtedness has been repaid in full from such assets. Principal, Maturity and Interest Floating Rate Notes The Floating Rate Notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million. The Floating Rate Senior Notes mature on May 1, 2014. Each Floating Rate Senior Notes bears interest at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to LIBOR plus 4%, as determined by the calculation agent (the Calculation Agent), which shall initially be the Floating Rate Trustee. Interest on the Floating Rate Senior Notes is payable quarterly in cash to Holders of record at the close of business on April 15, July 15, September 15 and January 15 immediately preceding the interest payment date, on May 1, August 1, November 1 and February 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 2007. The amount of interest for each day that the Floating Rate Senior Notes are outstanding (the Daily Interest Amount) is calculated by dividing the interest rate in effect for such day by 360 and multiplying the result by the principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior Notes then outstanding. The amount of interest to be paid on the Floating Rate Senior Notes for each Interest Period is calculated by adding the Daily Interest Amount for each day in the Interest Period. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards). The Calculation Agent will, upon the request of any Holder of Floating Rate Senior Notes, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Floating Rate Senior Notes. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent in the absence of manifest error will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company, the Guarantors and the Holders of the Floating Rate Senior Notes. Fixed Rate Senior Notes The Fixed Rate Senior Notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million. The Fixed Rate Senior Notes mature on May 1, 2014. Each Fixed Rate Senior Notes bears interest at the applicable rate per annum shown from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest on the Fixed Rate Senior Notes is payable semiannually in cash to Holders of record at the close of business on April 15 and October 15 immediately preceding the interest payment date, on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2007. Interest is paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and accrue from the date of original issuance. Additional securities may be issued under either of the Indentures in one or more series from time to time (Additional Notes), subject to the limitations set forth under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, which will vote as a class with the Senior Notes under that Indenture and will be treated as a single class with the Senior Notes issued thereunder for all purposes under that Indenture. Other Terms Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the applicable Senior Notes are payable, and such Senior Notes may be exchanged or transferred, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such 21 purposes (which shall initially be the corporate trust office of the Trustees), except that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the registered holders of such Senior Notes as such address appears in the applicable Note Register. Optional Redemption The Senior Notes are redeemable, at the Companys option, at any time prior to maturity at varying redemption prices in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth below. The Floating Rate Senior Notes are redeemable, at the Companys option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after May 1, 2009, and prior to maturity at the applicable redemption price set forth below. The Fixed Rate Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the Companys option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after May 1, 2010, and prior to maturity at the applicable redemption price set forth below. Such redemption may be made upon notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holders registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. The Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Companys obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. Any such redemption and notice may, in the Companys discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of a Change of Control. The Senior Notes will be so redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the relevant redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on May 1 of the years set forth below: The Floating Rate Senior Notes Redemption Period Price 2009 102.000 % 2010 101.000 % 2011 and thereafter 100.000 % The Fixed Rate Senior Notes Redemption Period Price 2010 104.375 % 2011 102.917 % 2012 101.458 % 2013 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, the Indentures provide, as applicable, that at any time and from time to time on or prior to May 1, 2010, the Company, at its option, may redeem Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to (a) up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes that are Floating Rate Senior Notes) and (b) up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Senior Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes that are Fixed Rate Senior Notes), with funds in an aggregate amount (the Redemption Amount) not exceeding the aggregate proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (as defined below), at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount thereof) of 100% plus the applicable rate of interest per annum on the date on which notice of redemption is given for the Floating Rate Senior Notes and 108.75% for the Fixed Rate Senior Notes, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption 22 date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that (a) if Floating Rate Senior Notes are redeemed, an aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes equal to at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes that are Floating Rate Senior Notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption of Floating Rate Senior Notes, and (b) if Fixed Rate Senior Notes are redeemed, an aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Senior Notes equal to at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Senior Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes that are Fixed Rate Senior Notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption of Fixed Rate Senior Notes. Such redemption may be made upon notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holders registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (but in no event more than 180 days after the completion of the related Equity Offering). The Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Companys obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. Any such notice may be given prior to the completion of the related Equity Offering, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Companys discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the completion of the related Equity Offering. At any time prior to May 1, 2009, in the case of the Floating Rate Senior Notes, and May 1, 2010, in the case of the Fixed Rate Senior Notes, such Senior Notes may also be redeemed or purchased (by the Company or any other Person) in whole or in part, at the Companys option, at a price (the Redemption Price) equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, the date of redemption or purchase (the Redemption Date) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Such redemption or purchase may be made upon notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holders registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. The Company may provide in such notice that payment of the Redemption Price and performance of the Companys obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person. Any such redemption, purchase or notice may, at the Companys discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of a Change of Control. Applicable Premium means, with respect to a Senior Note at any Redemption Date, the greater of (i) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Senior Note and (ii) the excess of (A) the present value at such Redemption Date of (1) the redemption price of such Senior Note on May 1, 2009, in the case of a Floating Rate Senior Note, and May 1, 2010, in the case of a Fixed Rate Senior Note, such redemption price being that described in the second paragraph of this Optional Redemption section plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Senior Note through such date (excluding accrued and unpaid interest through the Redemption Date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (B) the principal amount of such Note on such Redemption Date; as calculated by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate; provided that such calculation shall not be a duty or obligation of the applicable Trustee. Treasury Rate means, with respect to a Redemption Date, the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) that has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to such Redemption Date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the period from such Redemption Date to May 1, 2009, in the case of a Floating Rate Senior Note; and May 1, 2010, in the case of a Fixed Rate Senior Note; provided, however, that if the period from the Redemption Date to such date is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United 23 States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the Redemption Date to such date is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used. Selection In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the Senior Notes of the applicable series for redemption will be made by the applicable Trustee on a pro rata basis, or, to the extent a pro rata basis is not permitted, by such other method as such Trustee shall deem to be fair and appropriate, although no Senior Note of the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount or less will be redeemed in part. If any Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such Senior Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Senior Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Senior Note. Subsidiary Guarantees The Company will cause each Subsidiary that guarantees payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility to execute and deliver to the applicable Trustee a supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Senior Notes, whereupon such Subsidiary will become a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes under the Indentures. In addition, the Company may cause any Subsidiary or other Person that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor to guarantee payment of the Senior Notes and become a Subsidiary Guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, will jointly and severally, irrevocably, fully and unconditionally Guarantee, on an unsecured unsubordinated basis the punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all monetary obligations of the Company under the applicable Indenture and the applicable Senior Notes, whether for principal of or interest on the Senior Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors being herein called the Subsidiary Guaranteed Obligations). Each Subsidiary Guarantor will agree to pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the applicable Trustee or the applicable Holders in enforcing any rights under a Guarantee. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount, as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including but not limited to any Guarantee by it of any Bank Indebtedness), result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law, or being void or unenforceable under any law relating to insolvency of debtors. Each Guarantee shall be a continuing Guarantee and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the principal amount of all outstanding Senior Notes (whether by payment at maturity, purchase, redemption, defeasance, retirement or other acquisition) and all other applicable obligations then due and owing unless earlier terminated as described below, (ii) be binding upon such Guarantor and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the applicable Trustee, the Holders and their permitted successors, transferees and assigns. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, any Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally be released from all obligations under their Guarantees, and such Guarantees shall thereupon terminate and be discharged and of no further force or effect, (i) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, concurrently with any direct or indirect sale or disposition (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any interest therein not prohibited by the terms of the applicable Indenture (including the covenant described under 24 Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock and Merger and Consolidation) by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, following which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) at any time that such Subsidiary Guarantor is released from all of its obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility (it being understood that a release subject to contingent reinstatement is still a release, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated), (iii) upon the merger or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation, or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor following or contemporaneously with the transfer of all of its assets to the Company or another Guarantor, (iv) concurrently with a Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Unrestricted Subsidiary, (v) upon legal or covenant defeasance of the Companys obligations, or satisfaction and discharge of the applicable Indenture, or (vi) subject to customary contingent reinstatement provisions, upon payment in full of the aggregate principal amount of all applicable Senior Notes then outstanding. In addition, the Company will have the right, upon 30 days notice to the applicable Trustee, to cause any Subsidiary Guarantor that has not guaranteed payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facilities or the Senior Subordinated Notes to be unconditionally released from all obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee, and such Subsidiary Guarantee shall thereupon terminate and be discharged and of no further force or effect. Upon any such occurrence specified in this paragraph, the applicable Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Subsidiary Guarantee. Neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required to make a notation on the applicable Senior Notes to reflect any such Guarantee or any such release, termination or discharge. Ranking The indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Notes (a) is unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company, (b) ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and (c) is senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Obligations of the Company to the extent set forth in the instrument containing the applicable subordination agreement. The Senior Notes are unsecured. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency, the Companys secured lenders will have a prior secured claim to any collateral securing the debt owed to them. Each Subsidiary Guarantee (a) is unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of such Person and (c) is senior in right of payment to all existing and future Guarantor Subordinated Obligations of such Person to the extent set forth in the instrument containing the applicable subordination agreement. Each Subsidiary Guarantee is unsecured. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency, the secured lenders of each Subsidiary Guarantor will have a prior secured claim to any collateral securing the debt owed to them. A substantial part of the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred shareholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including holders of the Senior Notes, unless such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred shareholders (if any) of other Subsidiaries of the Company (other than Subsidiaries that become Subsidiary Guarantors). Certain of the operations of a Subsidiary Guarantor may be conducted through Subsidiaries thereof that are not also Subsidiary Guarantors. Claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred shareholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of such Subsidiary Guarantor, including claims under its Subsidiary Guarantee. Such Subsidiary Guarantee, if any, 25 therefore, will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred shareholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries. Although the Indentures limit the incurrence of Indebtedness (including preferred stock) by certain of the Companys Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications. Change of Control Upon the occurrence after the Issue Date of a Change of Control (as defined below), each Holder of Senior Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant in the event that it has exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Notes as described under Optional Redemption. The term Change of Control means: (i) any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than one or more Permitted Holders or a Parent, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company, provided that (x) so long as the Company is a Subsidiary of any Parent, no person shall be deemed to be or become a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company unless such person shall be or become a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such Parent and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the beneficial owner shall not in any case be included in any Voting Stock of which any such person is the beneficial owner; (ii) the Company or the Parent merges or consolidates with or into, or sells or transfers (in one or a series of related transactions) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, another Person (other than one or more Permitted Holders) and any person (as defined in clause (i) above), other than one or more Permitted Holders or any Parent, is or becomes the beneficial owner (as so defined), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation, or the transferee Person in such sale or transfer of assets, as the case may be, provided that (x) so long as such surviving or transferee Person is a Subsidiary of a parent Person, no person shall be deemed to be or become a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such surviving or transferee Person unless such person shall be or become a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such parent Person and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the beneficial owner shall not in any case be included in any Voting Stock of which any such person is the beneficial owner; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years (during which period the Company has been a party to the applicable Indenture), individuals who at the beginning of such period were members of the Board of Directors of the Company (together with any new members thereof whose election by such Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by holders of Equity Interests of the Company was approved by one or more Permitted Holders or by a vote of a majority of the members of such board of directors then still in office who were either members thereof at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of such board of directors then in office. Unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Notes as described under Optional Redemption, the Company shall, not later than 30 days following the date the Company obtains actual 26 knowledge of any Change of Control having occurred, mail a notice (a Change of Control Offer) to each Holder with a copy to the Trustees stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Company to purchase such Holders Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); (3) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Notes purchased; and (4) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, that such offer is conditioned on the occurrence of such Change of Control. No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the applicable Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, or (ii) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under the caption Optional Redemption, unless and until there is a Default in the payment of the applicable redemption price. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Change of Control covenant, the Company may comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by virtue thereof. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. The Company has no present plans to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indentures, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Companys capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Company to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under Certain covenantsLimitation on indebtedness and Certain covenantsLimitation on liens. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indentures will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The occurrence of a Change of Control would constitute a default under the Senior Credit Agreement. Agreements governing future Indebtedness of the Company may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control. The Senior Credit Agreement is expected to, and the agreements governing future Indebtedness of the Company may, prohibit the Company from repurchasing the Senior Notes upon a Change of Control unless the Indebtedness governed by such Senior Credit Agreement or the agreements governing such future Indebtedness, as the case may be, has been repurchased or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of those creditors accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Companys ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Companys then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The provisions under the Indentures relating to the Companys obligation to make an offer to purchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes. As 27 described above under Optional Redemption, the Company also has the right to redeem the Senior Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control or otherwise. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the Companys assets. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the holders of the Senior Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase such Senior Notes. Certain Covenants The Indentures contain covenants including, among others, the covenants as described below. Limitation on Indebtedness The Indentures provide as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, after giving effect to the Incurrence thereof, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.00 to 1.00. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur the following Indebtedness: (i) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to any Credit Facility (including but not limited to in respect of letters of credit or bankers acceptances issued or created thereunder) and Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor other than under any Credit Facility, and (without limiting the foregoing), in each case, any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in a maximum principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding in the aggregate the amount equal to $2,090.0 million; (ii) Indebtedness (A) of any Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or (B) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Equity Interests of such Restricted Subsidiary to which such Indebtedness is owed, or other event, that results in such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of such Indebtedness (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) will be deemed, in each case, an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the issuer thereof not permitted by this clause (ii) at the time of such issuance, transfer or other event; (iii) Indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors represented by the Senior Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, respectively, the Senior Subordinated Notes, the subsidiary guarantees thereof by the Subsidiary Guarantors, any Indebtedness (other than the Indebtedness described in clause (b)(ii) above) outstanding on the Issue Date and any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (b)(iii) or paragraph (a) above;

(vii) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (A) arising from the honoring of a check, draft or similar instrument of such Person drawn against insufficient funds, provided that such Indebtedness is extinguished within fifteen Business Days of its Incurrence, or (B) consisting of guarantees, indemnities, obligations in respect of earnouts or other purchase price adjustments, or similar obligations, Incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business, assets or Person; (viii) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of (A) deductible obligations, self-insurance obligations, re-insurance obligations, completion guarantees, surety, judgment, appeal or performance bonds, or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations, provided, or relating to liabilities or obligations incurred, in the ordinary course of business, or (B) Hedging Obligations entered into for bona fide hedging purposes (including, without limitation, to protect the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from fluctuations in currency exchange rates) that are incurred in the ordinary course of business, or (C) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business, or (D) netting, overdraft protection and other arrangements arising under standard business terms of any bank at which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary maintains an overdraft, cash pooling or other similar facility or arrangement; (ix) Indebtedness (A) of a Special Purpose Subsidiary secured by a Lien on all or part of the assets disposed of in, or otherwise Incurred in connection with, a Financing Disposition or (B) otherwise Incurred in connection with a Special Purpose Financing; provided that (1) such Indebtedness is not recourse to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Special Purpose Subsidiary (other than with respect to Special Purpose Financing Undertakings), (2) in the event such Indebtedness shall become recourse to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Special Purpose Subsidiary (other than with respect to Special Purpose Financing Undertakings), such Indebtedness will be deemed to be, and must be classified by the Company as, Incurred at such time (or at the time initially Incurred) under one or more of the other provisions of this covenant for so long as such Indebtedness shall be so recourse, and (3) in the event that at any time thereafter such Indebtedness shall comply with the provisions of the preceding subclause (1), the Company may classify such Indebtedness in whole or in part as Incurred under this clause (b)(ix) of this covenant; (x) Indebtedness (including any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (x)) (x) of any Person that is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with its acquisition of assets from such Person or any Affiliate thereof or is issued and outstanding on or prior to the date on which such Person was acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged or consolidated with or into any Restricted Subsidiary or (y) of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred to finance the acquisition of any Person or assets; provided that either: (1) after giving effect to such acquisition, merger or consolidation, either: (A) the Company would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Consolidated Coverage Ratio test set forth in paragraph (a) of this covenant; or (B) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio is greater than the Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such acquisition, merger or consolidation; (2) such Indebtedness (i) is not Secured Indebtedness and constitutes Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations, (ii) is not incurred while a Default exists and 29 no Default shall result therefrom, (iii) does not mature (and is not mandatorily redeemable in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) and does not require any payment of principal prior to the final maturity of the Senior Notes, and (iv) in the case of sub-clause (x) above only, is not incurred in contemplation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation; provided that the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (excluding any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (b)(x) that was not incurred to finance the acquisition of any Person or assets) at any time outstanding Incurred under this clause (b)(x) (including any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto) by any Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors shall not exceed $100.0 million in the aggregate;

provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing or incurrence. (c) For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant, (i) any other obligation of the obligor on such Indebtedness (or of any other Person who could have Incurred such Indebtedness under this covenant) arising under any Guarantee, Lien or letter of credit, bankers acceptance or other similar instrument or obligation supporting such Indebtedness shall be disregarded to the extent that such Guarantee, Lien or letter of credit, bankers acceptance or other similar instrument or obligation secures the principal amount of such Indebtedness; (ii) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in paragraphs (a) or (b) above, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall classify such item of Indebtedness and may 30 include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one or more of such clauses (including in part under one such clause and in part under another such clause), and may reclassify such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses; (iii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (i) of paragraph (b) above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; and (iv) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof shall be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP. (d) For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of such Indebtedness Incurred pursuant thereto shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date that such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness, pro vided that (x) the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date, (y) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency (or in a different currency from such Indebtedness so being Incurred), and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the outstanding or committed principal amount (whichever is higher) of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing, and (z) the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency and Incurred pursuant to a Senior Credit Facility shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on, at the Companys option, (i) the Issue Date, (ii) any date on which any of the respective commitments under such Senior Credit Facility shall be reallocated between or among facilities or subfacilities thereunder, or on which such rate is otherwise calculated for any purpose thereunder, or (iii) the date of such Incurrence. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Limitation on Restricted Payments The Indentures provide as follows: (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of its Equity Interests (including any such payment in connection with any merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party) except (x) dividends or distributions payable solely in its Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) and (y) dividends or distributions payable to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to other holders of its Equity Interests on no more than a pro rata basis), (ii) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Equity Interests of the Company held by Persons other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, (iii) voluntarily purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise voluntarily acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Obligations (other than a purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such acquisition or retirement) or (iv) make any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) in any Person (any such dividend, distribution, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance, other acquisition or retirement or Investment being herein referred to as a 31 Restricted Payment), if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment and after giving effect thereto: (1) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom); (2) the Company could not Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (a) of the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness; or (3) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments (the amount so expended, if other than in cash, to be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors) declared or made subsequent to the Issue Date and then outstanding would exceed, without duplication, the sum of: (A) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) beginning on the first day of the Companys fiscal quarter in which the Issue Date occurred to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such Restricted Payment for which Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are available (or, in case such Consolidated Net Income shall be a negative number, 100% of such negative number); (B) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the fair value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of property or assets received (x) by the Company as capital contributions to the Company after the Issue Date or from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) after the Issue Date or (y) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the issuance and sale by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness that shall have been converted into or exchanged after the Issue Date for Equity Interests of the Company or any Parent (other than Disqualified Stock), plus the amount of any cash and the fair value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of any property or assets, received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange; provided that this clause (B) shall not include such Net Cash Proceeds to the extent that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs Indebtedness pursuant to clause (b)(xv) of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness based on such Net Cash Proceeds; (C) the aggregate amount equal to the net reduction in Investments in Unrestricted Subsidiaries resulting from (i) dividends, distributions, cancellation of indebtedness for borrowed money owed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary, interest payments, return of capital, repayments of Investments or other transfers of assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from any Unrestricted Subsidiary, including dividends or other distributions related to dividends or other distributions made pursuant to clause (vii) of the following paragraph (b) (but only to the extent such amount is not included in Consolidated Net Income), or (ii) the redesignation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (valued in each case as provided in the definition of Investment), not to exceed in the case of any such Unrestricted Subsidiary the aggregate amount of Investments (other than Permitted Investments) made by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date; and (D) in the case of any disposition or repayment of any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment (without duplication of any amount deducted in calculating the amount of Investments at any time outstanding included in the amount of Restricted Payments), an amount in the aggregate equal to the lesser of the return of capital, repayment or other proceeds with respect to all such Investments received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and the initial amount of all such Investments constituting Restricted Payments. 32 (b) The provisions of the foregoing paragraph (a) do not prohibit any of the following, so long as a Default shall not have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom) (each, a Permitted Payment): (i) any purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Equity Interests of the Company or Subordinated Obligations made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the exercise of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares) for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent, or within 45 days, issuance or sale of, Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Equity Interests issued or sold to a Restricted Subsidiary) or a substantially concurrent, or within 45 days, capital contribution to the Company;

(v) notwithstanding the existence of any Default or Event of Default, loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any Parent or other payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to permit such Parent to make payments pursuant to (A) any Tax Sharing Agreement, or (B) to pay or permit any Parent to pay (1) any Parent Expenses or (2) any Related Taxes; (vi) payments by the Company, or loans, advances, dividends or distributions by the Company to any Parent to make payments, to holders of Equity Interests of the Company or any Parent in lieu of issuance of fractional shares of such Equity Interests, not to exceed $5.0 million in the aggregate outstanding at any time;

Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries. The Indentures provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any 34 Restricted Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Equity Interests or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company, (ii) make any loans or advances to the Company or (iii) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company (provided that dividend or liquidation priority between classes of Equity Interests, or subordination of any obligation (including the application of any remedy bars thereto) to any other obligation, will not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction), except any encumbrance or restriction: (1) pursuant to any agreement in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, including, without limitation, the Indentures, the Senior Notes, the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Senior Credit Facility or any other Credit Facility;

provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the applicable Senior Notes than encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment relates (as determined in good faith by the Company); (4)(A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract, (B) by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the applicable Indenture, (C) contained in mortgages, pledges or other security agreements securing Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent restricting the transfer of the property or assets subject thereto, (D) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (E) pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property or assets so acquired, (F) on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, (G) pursuant to customary provisions contained in agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business (including but not limited to leases, sale and leaseback agreements, asset sale agreements and joint venture and other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business), (H) that arises or is agreed to in the ordinary course of business and does not detract from the value of property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, or (I) pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

35 (6) by reason of any applicable law, rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their businesses; or (7) pursuant to an agreement or instrument (A) relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under Limitation on indebtedness (i) if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not less favorable to the Holders of the applicable Senior Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreements (as determined in good faith by the Company), or (ii) if such encumbrance or restriction is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders of the applicable Senior Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and either (x) the Company determines in good faith that such encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Companys ability to make principal or interest payments on the applicable Senior Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only if a default occurs in respect of a payment or financial covenant relating to such Indebtedness or (B) of, or relating to Indebtedness of or a Financing Disposition by or to or in favor of, any Special Purpose Entity. Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock The Indentures provide as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless (i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair market value of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition, as such fair market value may be determined (and shall be determined, to the extent such Asset Disposition or any series of related Asset Dispositions involves aggregate consideration in excess of $25.0 million) in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive (including as to the value of all noncash consideration); (ii) in the case of any Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions) having a fair market value of $25.0 million or more, at least 75% of the consideration therefor (excluding, in the case of an Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions), any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, that are not Indebtedness) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash; and (iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) as follows: (A) first, either (x) to the extent the Company elects (or is required by the terms of (1) any Bank Indebtedness, (2) any secured Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or (3) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor), to prepay, repay or purchase any such Indebtedness or (in the case of letters of credit, bankers acceptances or other similar instruments) cash collateralize any such Indebtedness (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 360 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, or (y) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount equal to Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 360 days from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, or, if such investment in Additional Assets is a project authorized by the Board of Directors that will take longer than such 360 days to complete, the period of time necessary to complete such project; 36 (B) second, if the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A) above (and after the expiration of the maximum period for such application permitted by clause (A)) exceeds $20.0 million, (such balance, the Excess Proceeds), to the extent of such Excess Proceeds, to make an offer to purchase Senior Notes and (to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, or is required by the terms thereof) to purchase, redeem or repay any other unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant and subject to the conditions of the Indentures and the agreements governing such other Indebtedness; and (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) above, to fund (to the extent consistent with any other applicable provision of the Indentures) any general corporate purpose (including but not limited to the repurchase, repayment or other acquisition or retirement of any Subordinated Obligations); provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (A)(x) or (B) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to apply any Net Available Cash or equivalent amount in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions or equivalent amount that is not applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds $50.0 million. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes or other unsubordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary validly tendered and not withdrawn (or otherwise subject to purchase, redemption or repayment) in connection with an offer pursuant to clause (B) above exceeds the Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds will be apportioned between such Senior Notes and such other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, with the portion of the Excess Proceeds payable in respect of such Senior Notes to equal the lesser of (x) the Excess Proceeds amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such Senior Notes and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes and the outstanding principal amount of the relevant other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn. For the purposes of clause (ii) of paragraph (a) above, the following are deemed to be cash: (1) Temporary Cash Investments and Cash Equivalents, (2) the assumption of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock of the Company) or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition, (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition, (4) securities received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days, (5) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (6) any Designated Noncash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Disposition having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $50.0 million or (y) 1.25% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Senior Notes pursuant to clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) above, the Company will be required to purchase Senior Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the applicable Senior Notes (the Offer) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Purchase Date in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in 37 the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indentures. If the aggregate purchase price of the applicable Senior Notes tendered pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of applicable Senior Notes, the remaining Net Available Cash will be available to the Company for use in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) above (to repay other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) or clause (iii)(C) of paragraph (a) above. The Company shall not be required to make an Offer for Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in clause (iii)(A) of paragraph (a) above) is less than $50.0 million for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount. (c) Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, such Net Available Cash may be applied to temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the applicable Indenture. (d) To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock covenant, the Company may comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by virtue thereof. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates The Indentures provide as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an Affiliate Transaction) unless: (i) such Affiliate Transaction is entered into in good faith and the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are, taken as a whole, fair and reasonable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary; and (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of $25.0 million, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors. For purposes of this paragraph, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this paragraph if (x) such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or (y) in the event there are no Disinterested Directors, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives an opinion in customary form from a nationally recognized appraisal or investment banking firm to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view. (b) The provisions of the preceding paragraph (a) will not apply to: (i) any Restricted Payment Transaction; (ii)(1) the entering into, maintaining or performance of any employment contract, collective bargaining agreement, benefit plan, program or arrangement, related trust agreement or any other similar arrangement for or with any employee, officer or director heretofore or hereafter entered into in the ordinary course of business, including vacation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or other similar plans, programs or arrangements, (2) the payment of compensation, performance of indemnification or contribution obligations, or any issuance, grant or award of stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, to employees, officers or directors in the ordinary course of business, (3) the payment of reasonable fees to directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined in good faith by the Company or such Subsidiary) 38 or (4) Management Advances and payments in respect thereof (or in reimbursement of any expenses referred to in the definition of such term); (iii) any transaction with, including an Investment in, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (iv) any transaction arising out of and any payments made pursuant to agreements or instruments in existence on the Issue Date (other than any Tax Sharing Agreement referred to in clause (b)(vi) of this covenant), including, without limitation, the Transaction Documents, and as the same may be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time so long as such amendment, modification, supplement or replacement is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders than the original agreement or instrument as in effect on the Issue Date; (v) any transaction in the ordinary course of business, or approved by a majority of the Board of Directors, between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company controlled by the Company that is a joint venture or similar entity; (vi) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement; (vii) any issuance or sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company (and the granting of registration rights or other customary rights in connection therewith) or capital contribution to the Company; (viii) transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or Equity Interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, where such Affiliates hold less Indebtedness or Equity Interests than non-Affiliates and such Affiliates receive the same consideration as non-Affiliates in such transactions; (ix) any transaction with any Person who is not an Affiliate immediately before the consummation of such transaction that becomes an Affiliate as a result of such transaction; (x) transactions between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Special Purpose Subsidiary in connection with a Financing Disposition or a Special Purpose Financing, provided that such transactions are not otherwise prohibited by the applicable Indenture; (xi) transactions exclusively between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, provided such transactions are not otherwise prohibited by the Indentures; (xii) transactions involving aggregate consideration not to exceed $1.0 million; (xiii) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder or any of its affiliates for any financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisition or divestitures, which payments are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors; and (xiv) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or that are on terms at least as favorable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party, or that are considered fair to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the view of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or the senior management of the Company. Limitation on Liens The Indentures provide that the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of its property or assets (including Equity Interests of any other Person), whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, securing any Indebtedness (the Initial Lien), unless contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Indebtedness due under the Indentures and the Senior Notes or, in respect of Liens on any Restricted Subsidiarys property or assets, any Subsidiary Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations) such obligation for so long as such obligation is so secured by such Initial Lien. Any such Lien 39 thereby created in favor of the Senior Notes or any such Subsidiary Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any such Subsidiary Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indentures or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under Merger and Consolidation below) to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company of the property or assets secured by such Initial Lien, or of all of the Equity Interests held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such Initial Lien. Future Subsidiary Guarantors As set forth more particularly under Subsidiary Guarantees, the Indentures provide that the Company will cause each Subsidiary that guarantees payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facilities to execute and deliver to the Trustees a supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Senior Notes, whereupon such Subsidiary will become a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes under the Indentures. The Company will also have the right to cause any other Subsidiary so to guarantee payment of the Senior Notes. Subsidiary Guarantees will be subject to release and discharge under certain circumstances prior to payment in full of the Senior Notes. See Subsidiary Guarantees. SEC Reports The Indentures provide that, following consummation of the exchange offer, notwithstanding that the Company may not be required to be or remain subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will file with the SEC (unless such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act or by the SEC), so long as any Notes are outstanding, the annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d) or would be so required to file if the Company were so subject within the time periods specified above. The Company will also, within 15 days after the time periods specified above, transmit by mail to all applicable Holders, as their names and addresses appear in the applicable Note Register, and to the Trustees (or make available on a Company website) copies of any such information, documents and reports (without exhibits) so required to be filed. The Company will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of this covenant if any Parent files with the SEC and provides reports, documents and information of the types otherwise so required, in each case within the applicable time periods specified by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and the Company is not required to file such reports, documents and information separately under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (after giving effect to any exemptive relief) because of the filings by such Parent. The Company will comply with the other provisions of TIA § 314(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirements of this covenant shall be deemed satisfied prior to the commencement of the exchange offer or the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement described in the Registration Rights Agreement (1) by the filing with the SEC of the exchange offer registration statement or shelf registration statement (or any other similar registration statement), and any amendments thereto, with such financial information that satisfies Regulation S-X, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in this prospectus, to the extent filed within the times specified above, or (2) by posting on the Companys website (or that of any of its parent companies) or providing such reports to the Trustee within 15 days after the time periods specified above, the financial information (including a Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section) that would be required to be included in such reports, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in this prospectus. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be deemed to have failed to comply with any of its agreements set forth under this covenant for purposes of clause (v) under Defaults until 120 days after the date any report required to be provided by this covenant is due. 40 Merger and Consolidation The Indentures provide that the Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless: (i) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the Successor Company) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume all the obligations of the Company under the applicable Senior Notes and the Indentures by executing and delivering to the applicable Trustee a supplemental indenture or one or more other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to such Trustee; (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default will have occurred and be continuing; (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (A) the Successor Company could Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (a) of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, or (B) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of the Company (or, if applicable, the Successor Company with respect thereto) would equal or exceed the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; (iv) each applicable Subsidiary Guarantor (other than (x) any Subsidiary Guarantor that will be released from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee in connection with such transaction and (y) any party to any such consolidation or merger) shall have delivered a supplemental indenture or other document or instrument in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustees, confirming its Subsidiary Guarantee (other than any Subsidiary Guarantee that will be discharged or terminated in connection with such transaction); and (v) the Company will have delivered to each such Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer complies with the provisions described in this covenant, provided that (x) in giving such opinion such counsel may assume compliance with the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) to the extent such opinion would otherwise be required to address financial matters or tests and, as to any matters of fact, may rely on an Officers Certificate, and (y) no Opinion of Counsel will be required for a consolidation, merger or transfer described in the last paragraph of this covenant. Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness. The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indentures, and thereafter the predecessor Company shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Indentures, except that the predecessor Company in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Senior Notes. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph of this Merger and Consolidation covenant will not apply to any transaction in which (1) any Restricted Subsidiary consolidates with, merges with or into or conveys or transfers all or part of its assets to the Company or (2) the Company consolidates with or merges with or into or conveys or transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to (x) an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the 41 purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Company in another jurisdiction or changing its legal structure to a corporation or other entity or (y) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company so long as all assets of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction (other than Equity Interests of such Restricted Subsidiary) are owned by such Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately after the consummation thereof. Defaults An Event of Default is defined in the Indentures as: (i) a default in any payment of interest on any applicable Note when due, continued for 30 days; (ii) a default in the payment of principal of any applicable Note when due, whether at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (iii) the failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with its obligations under the first paragraph of the covenant described under Merger and Consolidation above; (iv) the failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply for 30 days after notice with any of its obligations under the covenant described under Change of Control above (other than a failure to purchase Senior Notes); (v) the failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the applicable Senior Notes or the applicable Indenture; (vi) the failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay any Indebtedness within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, if the total amount of such Indebtedness so unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary, or of other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries but would in the aggregate constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single Person (the bankruptcy provisions); (viii) the rendering of any judgment or decree for the payment of money in an amount (net of any insurance or indemnity payments actually received in respect thereof prior to or within 60 days from the entry thereof, or to be received in respect thereof in the event any appeal thereof shall be unsuccessful) in excess of $50.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary, or jointly and severally against other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries but would in the aggregate constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single Person, that is not discharged, or bonded or insured by a third Person, if such judgment or decree remains outstanding for a period of 60 days following such judgment or decree and is not discharged, waived or stayed (the judgment default provision); or (ix) the failure of any applicable Subsidiary Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof or of the Indentures) or the denial or disaffirmation in writing by any applicable Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary of its obligations under the applicable Indenture or any applicable Subsidiary Guarantee. The foregoing constitutes Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a Default under clause (iv) or (v) will not constitute an Event of Default until the applicable Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes of the applicable class notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clause after receipt of such notice. 42 If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing the applicable Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes of the applicable class by notice to the Company and the applicable Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all applicable Senior Notes to be due and payable. Upon the effectiveness of such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the applicable Senior Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the applicable Trustee or any applicable Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the applicable Senior Notes and its consequences. In the event of any Default or Event of Default specified in clause (vi) above, such Default or Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Notes) shall not be deemed to have occurred and shall be annulled, waived and rescinded automatically, in each case, without any action by the applicable Trustee or the applicable Holders if, within 20 days after such Event of Default arose, (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indentures relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, such Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indentures at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to such Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indentures or the applicable Senior Notes unless (i) such Holder has previously given the applicable Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes of the applicable class have requested such Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered such Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense, (iv) such Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes of the applicable class have not given such Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes of the applicable class are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the applicable Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on such Trustee. Either Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the applicable Indenture or that such Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve such Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under either Indenture, the applicable Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indentures provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the applicable Trustee, such Trustee must mail to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium (if any) or interest on, any Note, the applicable Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Noteholders. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustees, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default occurring during the previous year. The Company also is required to deliver to the Trustees, within 30 43 days after an Officer of the Company becomes aware of the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event that would constitute a Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Amendments and Waivers Subject to certain exceptions, each Indenture may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes issued thereunder then outstanding and any past Default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes of the applicable class then outstanding (including in each case, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Senior Notes). However, without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Note affected, no amendment or waiver may (i) reduce the principal amount of Senior Notes of the applicable class whose Holders must consent to an amendment or waiver, (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note of the applicable class, (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note of the applicable class, (iv) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note of the applicable class, or change the date at which any Senior Note may be redeemed as described under Optional Redemption above, (v) make any Senior Note of the applicable class payable in money other than that stated in such Senior Note, (vi) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holders Senior Notes of the applicable class on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holders Senior Notes of the applicable class, (vii) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations under the applicable Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of such Indenture or (viii) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions described in this sentence. Without the consent of any applicable Holder, the Company, the applicable Trustee and (as applicable) any Subsidiary Guarantor may amend either Indenture to cure or reform any ambiguity, mistake, manifest error, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by a successor of the obligations of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor under such Indenture, to provide for uncertificated Senior Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior Notes, to add Guarantees with respect to the Senior Notes, to secure the Senior Notes, to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Senior Notes when such release, termination or discharge is provided for under such Indenture, to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Noteholders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company, to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes, to conform the text of such Indenture, the Senior Notes issued thereunder or any Subsidiary Guarantee to any provision of this Description of Senior Notes, to increase the minimum denomination of Senior Notes to equal the dollar equivalent of 1,000 rounded up to the nearest $1,000 (including for purposes of redemption or repurchase of any Note in part), to provide additional rights or benefits to the Holders or make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder, to release a Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee or an Indenture in accordance with the applicable provisions of such Indenture, to provide for the appointment of a successor trustee, provided that the successor trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of such Indenture, or to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of such Indenture under the TIA or otherwise. The consent of the applicable Noteholders is not necessary under the Indentures to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or waiver. Until an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Noteholder is a continuing consent by such Noteholder and every subsequent Holder of all or part of the related Note. Any such Noteholder or subsequent holder may revoke such consent as to its Note by written notice to the applicable Trustee or the Company, received thereby before the date on which the Company certifies to such Trustee that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Senior Notes have consented to such amendment or 44 waiver. After an amendment or waiver under an Indenture becomes effective, the Company is required to mail to Noteholders a notice briefly describing such amendment or waiver. However, the failure to give such notice to all Noteholders, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment or waiver. Defeasance The Company at any time may terminate all its obligations under the applicable Senior Notes and the applicable Indenture (legal defeasance), except for certain obligations, including those relating to the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Senior Notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Senior Notes. The Company at any time may terminate its obligations under certain covenants under an Indenture, including the covenants described under Certain Covenants and Change of Control, the operation of the default provisions relating to such covenants described under Defaults above, the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Subsidiaries and the judgment default provision described under Defaults above, and the limitations contained in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) under Merger and Consolidation above (covenant defeasance). If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its applicable Subsidiary Guarantee and any security then securing the Senior Notes will be automatically released. The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the applicable Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the applicable Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (iv), (v) (as it relates to the covenants described under Certain Covenants above), (vi), (vii), (but only with respect to events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of a Subsidiary), (viii) or (ix) under Defaults above or because of the failure of the Company to comply with clause (iii), (iv) or (v) under Merger and Consolidation above. Either defeasance option may be exercised prior to any redemption date or to the maturity date for the applicable Senior Notes. In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the defeasance trust) with the applicable Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, sufficient (without reinvestment) to pay principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the applicable Senior Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to such Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of the applicable Senior Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel (x) must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable Federal income tax law since the Issue Date and (y) need not be delivered if all Senior Notes not theretofore delivered to such Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable, will become due and payable at its Stated Maturity within one year, or are to be called for redemption within one year, under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company). Satisfaction and Discharge The Indentures will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the applicable Senior Notes, as expressly provided for in such Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Notes of the applicable class when (i) either (a) all Senior Notes of the applicable 45 class previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Notes, and certain Senior Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the applicable Trustee for cancellation or (b) all Senior Notes of the applicable class not previously delivered to such Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and payable, (y) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (z) have been or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by such Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (ii) the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with such Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, sufficient (without reinvestment) to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Notes of the applicable class not previously delivered to such Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to, but not including, the date of redemption or their Stated Maturity, as the case may be; (iii) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under such Indenture by the Company; and (iv) the Company has delivered to such Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the Satisfaction and Discharge section of such Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of such Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officers Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)). No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Incorporators and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator, equity holder, member or stockholder of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any thereof shall have any liability for any obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indentures, the Senior Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, any such obligation or its creation. Each Noteholder, by accepting the Senior Notes, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Notes. Concerning the Trustees Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the Trustee under each of the Indentures and is appointed by the Company as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to the Senior Notes. The Indentures provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the applicable Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indentures. During the existence of an Event of Default, such Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indentures and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of such persons own affairs. The Indentures and the TIA will impose certain limitations on the rights of the applicable Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received by it in respect of any such claims, as security or otherwise. Each Trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions; provided, that if it acquires any conflicting interest as described in the TIA, it must eliminate such conflict, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as Trustee with such conflict, or resign. Transfer and Exchange A Noteholder may transfer or exchange Senior Notes in accordance with the applicable Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the registrar and the applicable Trustee may require such Noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Company may require such Noteholder to pay any taxes or other governmental charges required by law or permitted by the applicable Indenture. The 46 Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or purchase or to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 Business Days prior to the day of the mailing of the notice of redemption or purchase. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the Senior Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with the transfer or exchange. The Senior Notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes.

Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Indenture, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights as Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Brief Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes The Senior Subordinated Notes:  are general, senior subordinated obligations of the Company;  are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Company, including Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility and the Senior Notes;  are unsecured;  are structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Companys Subsidiaries (other than Subsidiaries that are or become Subsidiary Guarantors pursuant to the provisions described below under Subsidiary guarantees);  are limited to an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million, subject to our ability to issue Additional Notes;  mature on May 1, 2015;  bear interest at the rate per annum from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for;  were issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 or, if greater at the Issue Date, the dollar equivalent of 1,000 rounded up to the nearest $1,000 (the Minimum Denomination) and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof;  are represented by one or more registered Senior Subordinated Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by Senior Subordinated Notes in definitive form. See Book entry, Delivery and Form;  are pari passu in right of payment with all future senior subordinated indebtedness of the Company; and  are unconditionally guaranteed on an senior subordinated basis by each of the Companys current and future Subsidiaries that guarantees payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility or the Senior Notes. Because the Senior Subordinated Notes are unsecured, in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding-up of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors or upon default in payment with respect to, or the acceleration of, any Indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility or other secured indebtedness, the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors that secure other secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations on the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Guarantees only after all Indebtedness under such other secured indebtedness has been repaid in full from such assets. 74 Principal, Maturity and Interest Senior Subordinated Notes The Senior Subordinated Notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million. In January 2010, in connection with the closing of a cash tender offer for a portion of the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes, the Company prepaid approximately $225.6 million principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes with proceeds received from the Companys initial public offering of common stock (including the partial exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares). The Senior Subordinated Notes mature on May 1, 2015. Each Note bears interest at the rate per annum from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes is payable semiannually in cash to Holders of record at the close of business on April 15 and October 15 immediately preceding the interest payment date, on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2007. Interest is paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and accrue from the date of original issuance. Additional securities may be issued under the Indenture in one or more series from time to time (Additional Notes), subject to the limitations set forth under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, which will vote as a class with the Senior Subordinated Notes and will be treated as a single class with the Senior Subordinated Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. Other terms Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Senior Subordinated Notes are payable, and Senior Subordinated Notes may be exchanged or transferred, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purposes (which shall initially be the corporate trust office of the Trustee), except that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the registered holders of Senior Subordinated Notes as such address appears in the Note Register. Optional Redemption The Senior Subordinated Notes are redeemable, at the Companys option, at any time prior to maturity at varying redemption prices in accordance with the provisions set forth below. The Senior Subordinated Notes are redeemable, at the Companys option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after May 1, 2011, and prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth below. Such redemption may be made upon notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holders registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. The Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Companys obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. Any such redemption and notice may, in the Companys discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of a Change of Control. The Senior Subordinated Notes will be so redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the relevant redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on May 1 of the years set forth below: Redemption Period Price 2011 105.000 % 2012 102.500 % 2013 100.000 % 2014 and thereafter 100.000 % 75 In addition, the Indenture provides that at any time and from time to time on or prior to May 1, 2010, the Company, at its option, may redeem Senior Subordinated Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes), with funds in an aggregate amount (the Redemption Amount) not exceeding the aggregate proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (as defined below), at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount thereof) of 110.000%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that an aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes equal to at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes) must remain outstanding after each such redemption of Senior Subordinated Notes. Such redemption may be made upon notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holders registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (but in no event more than 180 days after the completion of the related Equity Offering). The Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Companys obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. Any such notice may be given prior to the completion of the related Equity Offering, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Companys discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the completion of the related Equity Offering. At any time prior to May 1, 2011, the Senior Subordinated Notes may also be redeemed or purchased (by the Company or any other Person) in whole or in part, at the Companys option, at a price (the Redemption Price) equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, the date of redemption or purchase (the Redemption Date) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Such redemption or purchase may be made upon notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holders registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. The Company may provide in such notice that payment of the Redemption Price and performance of the Companys obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person. Any such redemption, purchase or notice may, at the Companys discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of a Change of Control. Applicable Premium means, with respect to a Note at any Redemption Date, the greater of (i) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Note and (ii) the excess of (A) the present value at such Redemption Date of (1) the redemption price of such Note on May 1, 2011, such redemption price being that described in the second paragraph of this Optional Redemption section plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Note through such date (excluding accrued and unpaid interest through the Redemption Date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (B) the principal amount of such Note on such Redemption Date; as calculated by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate; provided that such calculation shall not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee. Treasury Rate means, with respect to a Redemption Date, the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) that has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to such Redemption Date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the period from such Redemption Date to May 1, 2011; provided, however, that if the period from the Redemption Date to such date is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the Redemption Date to such date is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used. 76 Selection In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the Senior Subordinated Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee on a pro rata basis, or, to the extent a pro rata basis is not permitted, by such other method as the Trustee shall deem to be fair and appropriate, although no Senior Subordinated Note of the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount or less will be redeemed in part. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such Senior Subordinated Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Senior Subordinated Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Senior Subordinated Note. Subsidiary Guarantees The Company will cause each Subsidiary that guarantees payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility or the Senior Notes to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes, whereupon such Subsidiary will become a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, the Company may cause any Subsidiary or other Person that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor to guarantee payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes and become a Subsidiary Guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, will jointly and severally, irrevocably, fully and unconditionally Guarantee, on an unsecured senior subordinated basis the punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all monetary obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Senior Subordinated Notes, whether for principal of or interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors being herein called the Subsidiary Guaranteed Obligations). Each Subsidiary Guarantor will agree to pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under a Guarantee. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount, as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including but not limited to any Guarantee by it of any Bank Indebtedness), result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law, or being void or unenforceable under any law relating to insolvency of debtors. Each Guarantee shall be a continuing Guarantee and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the principal amount of all outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes (whether by payment at maturity, purchase, redemption, defeasance, retirement or other acquisition) and all other applicable obligations then due and owing unless earlier terminated as described below, (ii) be binding upon such Guarantor and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the Holders and their permitted successors, transferees and assigns. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, any Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally be released from all obligations under their Guarantees, and such Guarantees shall thereupon terminate and be discharged and of no further force or effect, (i) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, concurrently with any direct or indirect sale or disposition (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any interest therein not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture (including the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock and Merger and Consolidation) by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, following which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) at any time that such Subsidiary Guarantor is released from all of its obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior 77 Credit Facility and the Senior Notes (it being understood that a release subject to contingent reinstatement is still a release, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated), (iii) upon the merger or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation, or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor following or contemporaneously with the transfer of all of its assets to the Company or another Guarantor, (iv) concurrently with a Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Unrestricted Subsidiary, (v) upon legal or covenant defeasance of the Companys obligations, or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, or (vi) subject to customary contingent reinstatement provisions, upon payment in full of the aggregate principal amount of all Senior Subordinated Notes then outstanding. In addition, the Company will have the right, upon 30 days notice to the Trustee, to cause any Subsidiary Guarantor that has not guaranteed payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility or the Senior Notes to be unconditionally released from all obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee, and such Subsidiary Guarantee shall thereupon terminate and be discharged and of no further force or effect. Upon any such occurrence specified in this paragraph, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Subsidiary Guarantee. Neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required to make a notation on the Senior Subordinated Notes to reflect any such Guarantee or any such release, termination or discharge. Ranking The indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Subordinated Notes (a) is unsecured senior subordinated indebtedness of the Company, (b) is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, including the obligations of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility and the Senior Notes, (c) ranks pari passu in right of payment with all future senior subordinated indebtedness of the Company and (d) is senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Obligations of the Company to the extent set forth in the instrument containing the applicable subordination agreement. The Senior Subordinated Notes are unsecured. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency, the Companys secured lenders will have a prior secured claim to any collateral securing the debt owed to them. Each Subsidiary Guarantee (a) is unsecured senior subordinated indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor, including its obligations, if any, under the Senior Credit Facility and the Senior Notes, (c) ranks pari passu in right of payment with all future senior subordinated indebtedness of such Person and (d) is senior in right of payment to all future Guarantor Subordinated Obligations of such Person to the extent set forth in the instrument containing the applicable subordination agreement. Each Subsidiary Guarantee is unsecured. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency, the secured lenders of each Subsidiary Guarantor will have a prior secured claim to any collateral securing the debt owed to them. A substantial part of the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred shareholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, unless such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Senior Subordinated Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred shareholders (if any) of other Subsidiaries of the Company (other than Subsidiaries that become Subsidiary Guarantors). Certain of the operations of a Subsidiary Guarantor may be conducted through Subsidiaries thereof that are not also Subsidiary Guarantors. Claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred shareholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of such Subsidiary Guarantor, including claims under its Subsidiary Guarantee. Such Subsidiary Guarantee, if any, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to creditors 78 (including trade creditors) and preferred shareholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including preferred stock) by certain of the Companys Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications. Subordination of the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is Senior Indebtedness will rank senior to the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The Senior Subordinated Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees will rank pari passu in all respects with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company and the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, respectively. We will agree in the Indenture that the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will not incur any Indebtedness that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to the Senior Indebtedness of such Person, unless such Indebtedness is Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the applicable Person or is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Subordinated Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee. The Indenture will not treat (i) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (ii) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Senior Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor or other arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor will be permitted to pay principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes (or pay any other Obligations relating to the Senior Subordinated Notes, including Special Interest, fees, costs, expenses, indemnities and rescission or damage claims) or make any deposit pursuant to the provisions described under Defeasance or Satisfaction and Discharge below and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Senior Subordinated Notes (collectively, pay the Senior Subordinated Notes) other than in the form of Permitted Junior Securities if either of the following occurs (a Payment Default): (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full in cash when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace or cure period); or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or paid in full in cash. Regardless of the foregoing, the Company is permitted to pay the Senior Subordinated Notes if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) (a Non-Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company will not be permitted to pay the Senior Subordinated Notes (except in the form of Permitted Junior Securities) for a period (a Payment Blockage Period) commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of written notice (a Blockage Notice) of such Non-Payment Default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period will end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated: (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; 79 (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described above, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company and related Subsidiary Guarantors are permitted to resume paying the Senior Subordinated Notes after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. The Senior Subordinated Notes shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness during such period; provided that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (other than the holders of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility), a Representative of holders of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods on the Senior Subordinated Notes is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be at least 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Blockage Notice to the Trustee will be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Blockage Notice (including by a Representative of holders of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility) unless such default has been waived for a period of not less than 90 days (it being acknowledged that any subsequent action, or any breach of any financial covenants during the period after the date of delivery of a Blockage Notice, that, in either case, would give rise to a Non-Payment Default pursuant to any provisions under which a Non-Payment Default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new Non-Payment Default for this purpose). In the event of any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company upon a total or partial liquidation or dissolution or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property: (1) the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company will be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes are entitled to receive any payment; (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions of the Indenture will be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes may receive Permitted Junior Securities; and (3) if a distribution is made to Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes that, due to the subordination provisions, should not have been made to them, such Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will be required to hold it in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear. The subordination and payment blockage provisions described above will not prevent a Default from occurring under the Indenture upon the failure of the Company to pay interest or principal with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes when due by their terms. If payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company must promptly notify the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness of the acceleration. So long as there shall remain outstanding any Senior Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility, a Blockage Notice may be given only by the administrative agent thereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the requisite lenders named therein. If any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is outstanding, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor may pay the Senior Subordinated Notes until five Business Days after the Representatives of all the Company of such Designated Senior Indebtedness receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay the Senior Subordinated Notes only if the Indenture otherwise permits payment at that time. 80 Each Subsidiary Guarantors obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee will be senior subordinated obligations of that Guarantor. As such, the rights of Holders to receive payment pursuant to such Subsidiary Guarantee will be subordinated in right of payment to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. The terms of the subordination and payment blockage provisions described above with respect to the Company obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes apply equally to the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee. A Holder by its acceptance of Senior Subordinated Notes agrees to be bound by such provisions and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee, on its behalf, to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided for in the Indenture and appoints the Trustee its attorney-in-fact for such purpose. By reason of the subordination provisions contained in the Indenture, in the event of a liquidation or insolvency proceeding, creditors of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor who are holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, may recover more, ratably, than the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, and creditors who are not holders of Senior Indebtedness may recover less, ratably, than holders of Senior Indebtedness and may recover more, ratably, than the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesYour right to receive payments on the Senior Subordinated Notes is junior to our existing indebtedness and possibly all of our future borrowings. Further, the guarantees of the Senior Subordinated Notes are junior to all of our guarantors existing indebtedness and possibly to all their future borrowings. The terms of the subordination provisions described above will not apply to payments from money or the proceeds of Government Securities held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the provisions described under Defeasance or Satisfaction and Discharge, if the foregoing subordination provisions were not violated at the time the applicable amounts were deposited in trust pursuant to such provisions. Change of Control Upon the occurrence after the Issue Date of a Change of Control (as defined below), each Holder of Senior Subordinated Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Senior Subordinated Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to this covenant in the event that it has exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Subordinated Notes as described under Optional Redemption. The term Change of Control means: (i) any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than one or more Permitted Holders or a Parent, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company, provided that (x) so long as the Company is a Subsidiary of any Parent, no person shall be deemed to be or become a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company unless such person shall be or become a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such Parent and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the beneficial owner shall not in any case be included in any Voting Stock of which any such person is the beneficial owner; 81 (ii) the Company or the Parent merges or consolidates with or into, or sells or transfers (in one or a series of related transactions) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, another Person (other than one or more Permitted Holders) and any person (as defined in clause (i) above), other than one or more Permitted Holders or any Parent, is or becomes the beneficial owner (as so defined), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation, or the transferee Person in such sale or transfer of assets, as the case may be, provided that (x) so long as such surviving or transferee Person is a Subsidiary of a parent Person, no person shall be deemed to be or become a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such surviving or transferee Person unless such person shall be or become a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such parent Person and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the beneficial owner shall not in any case be included in any Voting Stock of which any such person is the beneficial owner; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years (during which period the Company has been a party to the Indenture), individuals who at the beginning of such period were members of the Board of Directors of the Company (together with any new members thereof whose election by such Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by holders of Equity Interests of the Company was approved by one or more Permitted Holders or by a vote of a majority of the members of such board of directors then still in office who were either members thereof at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of such board of directors then in office. Unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Subordinated Notes as described under Optional Redemption, the Company shall, not later than 30 days following the date the Company obtains actual knowledge of any Change of Control having occurred, mail a notice (a Change of Control Offer) to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Company to purchase such Holders Senior Subordinated Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); (3) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Subordinated Notes purchased; and (4) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, that such offer is conditioned on the occurrence of such Change of Control. No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Senior Subordinated Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, or (ii) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under the caption Optional Redemption, unless and until there is a Default in the payment of the applicable redemption price. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Change of Control covenant, the Company may comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by virtue thereof. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. The Company has no present plans to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the 82 amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Companys capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Company to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness and Certain CovenantsLimitation on Liens. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The occurrence of a Change of Control would constitute a default under the Senior Credit Agreement. Agreements governing future Indebtedness of the Company may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control. The Senior Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes will, and the agreements governing future Indebtedness of the Company may, prohibit or limit the Company from repurchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes upon a Change of Control unless the Indebtedness governed by such Senior Credit Agreement, the Senior Notes or the agreements governing such future Indebtedness, as the case may be, has been repurchased or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of those creditors accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Senior Subordinated Notes could cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company and its Subsidiaries. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness to permit the purchase of the Senior Subordinated Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes. In such case, the Companys failure to purchase tendered Senior Subordinated Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If, as a result thereof, a default occurs with respect to any Senior Indebtedness, the subordination provisions in the Indenture would restrict payments to the Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances. Finally, the Companys ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Companys then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Companys obligation to make an offer to purchase the Senior Subordinated Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes. As described above under Optional Redemption, the Company also has the right to redeem the Senior Subordinated Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control or otherwise. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the Companys assets. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Senior Subordinated Notes. Certain Covenants The Indenture contains covenants including, among others, the covenants as described below. Limitation on Indebtedness The Indenture provides as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of 83 the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, after giving effect to the Incurrence thereof, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.00 to 1.00. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur the following Indebtedness: (i) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to any Credit Facility (including but not limited to in respect of letters of credit or bankers acceptances issued or created thereunder) and Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor other than under any Credit Facility, and (without limiting the foregoing), in each case, any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in a maximum principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding in the aggregate the amount equal to $2,090.0 million; (ii) Indebtedness (A) of any Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or (B) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Equity Interests of such Restricted Subsidiary to which such Indebtedness is owed, or other event, that results in such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of such Indebtedness (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) will be deemed, in each case, an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the issuer thereof not permitted by this clause (ii) at the time of such issuance, transfer or other event; (iii) Indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors represented by the Senior Subordinated Notes and the subsidiary guarantees thereof by the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Senior Notes, the subsidiary guarantees thereof by the Subsidiary Guarantors, any Indebtedness (other than the Indebtedness described in clause (b)(ii) above) outstanding on the Issue Date and any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (b)(iii) or paragraph (a) above; (iv) Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease Obligations, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto in an aggregate outstanding principal amount at any time not to exceed the greater of (x) $75.0 million or (y) an amount equal to 2.0% of Total Assets; (v) Indebtedness consisting of accommodation guarantees for the benefit of trade creditors of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (vi)(A) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or any other obligation or liability of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than any Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in violation of the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness), or (B) without limiting the covenant described under Limitation on Liens, Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than any Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in violation of the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness); (vii) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (A) arising from the honoring of a check, draft or similar instrument of such Person drawn against insufficient funds, provided that such Indebtedness is extinguished within fifteen Business Days of its Incurrence, or (B) consisting of guarantees, indemnities, obligations in respect of earnouts or other purchase price adjustments, or similar obligations, Incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business, assets or Person; (viii) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of (A) deductible obligations, self-insurance obligations, re-insurance obligations, completion guarantees, surety, judgment, appeal or performance bonds, or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations, provided, or relating to liabilities or obligations incurred, in the ordinary course of business, or (B) Hedging Obligations entered into for bona fide hedging purposes (including, without limitation, to protect the 84 Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from fluctuations in currency exchange rates) that are incurred in the ordinary course of business, or (C) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business, or (D) netting, overdraft protection and other arrangements arising under standard business terms of any bank at which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary maintains an overdraft, cash pooling or other similar facility or arrangement; (ix) Indebtedness (A) of a Special Purpose Subsidiary secured by a Lien on all or part of the assets disposed of in, or otherwise Incurred in connection with, a Financing Disposition or (B) otherwise Incurred in connection with a Special Purpose Financing; provided that (1) such Indebtedness is not recourse to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Special Purpose Subsidiary (other than with respect to Special Purpose Financing Undertakings), (2) in the event such Indebtedness shall become recourse to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Special Purpose Subsidiary (other than with respect to Special Purpose Financing Undertakings), such Indebtedness will be deemed to be, and must be classified by the Company as, Incurred at such time (or at the time initially Incurred) under one or more of the other provisions of this covenant for so long as such Indebtedness shall be so recourse, and (3) in the event that at any time thereafter such Indebtedness shall comply with the provisions of the preceding subclause (1), the Company may classify such Indebtedness in whole or in part as Incurred under this clause (b)(ix) of this covenant; (x) Indebtedness (including any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (x)) (x) of any Person that is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with its acquisition of assets from such Person or any Affiliate thereof or is issued and outstanding on or prior to the date on which such Person was acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged or consolidated with or into any Restricted Subsidiary or (y) of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred to finance the acquisition of any Person or assets; provided that either: (1) after giving effect to such acquisition, merger or consolidation, either: (A) the Company would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Consolidated Coverage Ratio test set forth in paragraph (a) of this covenant; or (B) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio is greater than the Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such acquisition, merger or consolidation; (2) such Indebtedness (i) is not Secured Indebtedness and constitutes Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated Obligations, (ii) is not incurred while a Default exists and no Default shall result therefrom, (iii) does not mature (and is not mandatorily redeemable in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) and does not require any payment of principal prior to the final maturity of the Senior Subordinated Notes, and (iv) in the case of sub-clause (x) above only, is not incurred in contemplation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation; provided that the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (excluding any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (b)(x) that was not incurred to finance the acquisition of any Person or assets) at any time outstanding Incurred under this clause (b)(x) (including any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto) by any Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors shall not exceed $100.0 million in the aggregate; (xi) in addition to the items referred to in clauses (b)(i) through (b)(x) above, Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate outstanding principal amount at any time not to exceed an amount equal to the greater of (x) $100.0 million and (y) 2.75% of Total Assets; (xii) Indebtedness of one or more Foreign Subsidiaries and guarantees thereof by the Company in an aggregate outstanding principal amount at any time not to exceed an amount equal to the greater of (x) the sum of (1) $50.0 million for Foreign Subsidiaries and (2) $25.0 million for Canadian Subsidiaries or (y) 2.00% of Total Assets; 85 (xiii) Indebtedness in connection with the Atlanta IRB Transaction and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto; (xiv) Indebtedness consisting of promissory notes issued to present or former officers, directors or employees of any the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary upon the death, disability, retirement or termination of employment or service of such officer, director or employee or otherwise to finance the purchase or redemption of Equity Interests of the Company or any Parent, to the extent the applicable Restricted Payment is permitted by clause (b)(x) of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Restricted Payments; (xv) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary equal to 200.0% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company as capital contributions to the Company after the Issue Date or from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) after the Issue Date as determined in accordance with clause (a)(3)(B) of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Restricted Payments, to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds have not been applied to make Restricted Payments or to make other Investments, payments or exchanges pursuant to the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Restricted Payments or to make Permitted Investments (other than Permitted Investments specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition thereof); and (xvi) Indebtedness incurred by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries constituting reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business, including letters of credit in respect of workers compensation claims, health, disability or other employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance, or other Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement type obligations regarding workers compensation claims; provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing or incurrence. (c) For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant, (i) any other obligation of the obligor on such Indebtedness (or of any other Person who could have Incurred such Indebtedness under this covenant) arising under any Guarantee, Lien or letter of credit, bankers acceptance or other similar instrument or obligation supporting such Indebtedness shall be disregarded to the extent that such Guarantee, Lien or letter of credit, bankers acceptance or other similar instrument or obligation secures the principal amount of such Indebtedness; (ii) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in paragraphs (a) or (b) above, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall classify such item of Indebtedness and may include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one or more of such clauses (including in part under one such clause and in part under another such clause), and may reclassify such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses; (iii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (i) of paragraph (b) above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; and (iv) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof shall be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP. (d) For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of such Indebtedness Incurred pursuant thereto shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date that such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness, provided that (x) the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date, (y) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency (or in a different currency from such Indebtedness so being Incurred), and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated 86 at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the outstanding or committed principal amount (whichever is higher) of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing, and (z) the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency and Incurred pursuant to a Senior Credit Facility shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on, at the Companys option, (i) the Issue Date, (ii) any date on which any of the respective commitments under such Senior Credit Facility shall be reallocated between or among facilities or subfacilities thereunder, or on which such rate is otherwise calculated for any purpose thereunder, or (iii) the date of such Incurrence. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Limitation on Restricted Payments The Indenture provides as follows: (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of its Equity Interests (including any such payment in connection with any merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party) except (x) dividends or distributions payable solely in its Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) and (y) dividends or distributions payable to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to other holders of its Equity Interests on no more than a pro rata basis), (ii) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Equity Interests of the Company held by Persons other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, (iii) voluntarily purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise voluntarily acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Obligations (other than a purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such acquisition or retirement) or (iv) make any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) in any Person (any such dividend, distribution, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance, other acquisition or retirement or Investment being herein referred to as a Restricted Payment), if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment and after giving effect thereto: (1) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom); (2) the Company could not Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (a) of the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness; or (3) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments (the amount so expended, if other than in cash, to be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors) declared or made subsequent to the Issue Date and then outstanding would exceed, without duplication, the sum of: (A) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) beginning on the first day of the Companys fiscal quarter in which the Issue Date occurred to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such Restricted Payment for which Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are available (or, in case such Consolidated Net Income shall be a negative number, 100% of such negative number); 87 (B) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the fair value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of property or assets received (x) by the Company as capital contributions to the Company after the Issue Date or from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) after the Issue Date or (y) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the issuance and sale by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness that shall have been converted into or exchanged after the Issue Date for Equity Interests of the Company or any Parent (other than Disqualified Stock), plus the amount of any cash and the fair value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of any property or assets, received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange; provided that this clause (B) shall not include such Net Cash Proceeds to the extent that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs Indebtedness pursuant to clause (b)(xv) of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness based on such Net Cash Proceeds; (C) the aggregate amount equal to the net reduction in Investments in Unrestricted Subsidiaries resulting from (i) dividends, distributions, cancellation of indebtedness for borrowed money owed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary, interest payments, return of capital, repayments of Investments or other transfers of assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from any Unrestricted Subsidiary, including dividends or other distributions related to dividends or other distributions made pursuant to clause (vii) of the following paragraph (b) (but only to the extent such amount is not included in Consolidated Net Income), or (ii) the redesignation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (valued in each case as provided in the definition of Investment), not to exceed in the case of any such Unrestricted Subsidiary the aggregate amount of Investments (other than Permitted Investments) made by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date; and (D) in the case of any disposition or repayment of any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment (without duplication of any amount deducted in calculating the amount of Investments at any time outstanding included in the amount of Restricted Payments), an amount in the aggregate equal to the lesser of the return of capital, repayment or other proceeds with respect to all such Investments received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and the initial amount of all such Investments constituting Restricted Payments. (b) The provisions of the foregoing paragraph (a) do not prohibit any of the following, so long as a Default shall not have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom) (each, a Permitted Payment): (i) any purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Equity Interests of the Company or Subordinated Obligations made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the exercise of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares) for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent, or within 45 days, issuance or sale of, Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Equity Interests issued or sold to a Restricted Subsidiary) or a substantially concurrent, or within 45 days, capital contribution to the Company; provided, that the Net Cash Proceeds from such issuance, sale or capital contribution shall be excluded in subsequent calculations under clause (3)(B) of the preceding paragraph (a); (ii)(A) any purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Obligations (w) made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent issuance or sale of, Indebtedness of the Company or Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness, (x) from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted by the covenant described under Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock, and, if required, purchased all Senior Subordinated Notes tendered pursuant to the 88 offer to repurchase all the Senior Subordinated Notes required thereby prior to purchasing or repaying such Subordinated Obligations (y) following the occurrence of a Change of Control (or other similar event described therein as a Change of Control), but only if the Company shall have complied with the covenant described under Change of Control and, if required thereby, purchased all Senior Subordinated Notes tendered pursuant to the offer to repurchase all the Senior Subordinated Notes required thereby, prior to purchasing or repaying such Subordinated Obligations or (z) constituting Acquired Indebtedness or (B) any purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Disqualified Stock made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent, or within 45 days, issuance or sale of, Disqualified Stock of the Company or Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness;

(v) notwithstanding the existence of any Default or Event of Default, loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any Parent or other payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to permit such Parent to make payments pursuant to (A) any Tax Sharing Agreement, or (B) to pay or permit any Parent to pay (1) any Parent Expenses or (2) any Related Taxes;

(ix) Restricted Payments (including loans and advances) in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not exceeding an amount (net of repayments of such loans or advances) equal to the greater of (x) $100.0 million and (y) 2.75% of Total Assets; (x) the purchase, redemption or other acquisition, cancellation or retirement for value of Equity Interests of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent held by any existing or former employees or management or directors of the Company or any Parent or any Subsidiary of the Company or their assigns, estates or heirs, in each case in connection with (x) the death or disability of such employee, manager or director or (y) the repurchase provisions under employee stock option or stock purchase agreements or other agreements to compensate management employees or directors; provided that in the case of clause (y) such redemptions or repurchases pursuant to such clause will not exceed $20.0 million in the aggregate during any twelve-month period (which shall increase to $40.0 million subsequent to the consummation of an underwritten public Equity Offering) plus the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company after the Issue Date from the issuance of such Equity Interests or equity appreciation rights to, or the exercise of options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire Equity Interests of the Company by, any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or from key man life insurance policies which are used to make such redemptions or repurchases; provided that the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company and utilized pursuant to this clause (x) for any such repurchase, redemption, 89 acquisition or retirement will be excluded from clause (a)(3)(B) of the preceding paragraph; and provided, further, that unused amounts available pursuant to this clause (x) to be utilized for Restricted Payments during any twelve-month period may be carried forward and utilized in the next succeeding twenty-four-month period;

(xii) Restricted Payments made pursuant to, or contemplated by, or made to any Parent to permit any Parent to perform its obligations under, the Transactions, including the provisions of any Transaction Document as in effect on the Issue Date, and as the same may be amended or replaced so long as such amendment or replacement that is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders than the original Transaction Document as in effect on the Issue Date; (xiii) repurchases by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of all (but not less than all), excluding directors qualifying shares, of the Equity Interests or other ownership interests in a Subsidiary of the Company which Equity Interests or other ownership interests were not theretofore owned by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; (xiv) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to its guarantee of AFCs customary servicing obligations in connection with the Receivables Purchase Agreement; and (xv) Restricted Payments that are made with Excluded Contributions;

Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries The Indenture provides that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Equity Interests or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company, (ii) make any loans or advances to the Company or (iii) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company (provided that dividend or liquidation priority between classes of Equity Interests, or subordination of any obligation (including the application of any remedy bars thereto) to any other obligation, will not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction), except any encumbrance or restriction: (1) pursuant to any agreement in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, including, without limitation, the Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Senior Note Indentures, the Senior Notes, the Senior Credit Facility or any other Credit Facility; (2) pursuant to any agreement or instrument of a Person, or relating to Indebtedness or Equity Interests of a Person, which Person is acquired by or merged or consolidated with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or which agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets from such Person, as in effect at the time of such acquisition, merger or consolidation (except to the extent that such Indebtedness was incurred to finance, or otherwise in connection with, such acquisition, merger or consolidation); provided that for purposes of this clause (2), if a Person other than the Company is the Successor Company with respect thereto, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed 90 acquired or assumed, as the case may be, by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, when such Person becomes such Successor Company; (3) pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a Refinancing Agreement) effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise extends, renews, refunds, refinances or replaces, an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this covenant or this clause (3) (an Initial Agreement) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an Initial Agreement (an Amendment); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes than encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment relates (as determined in good faith by the Company); (4)(A) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract, (B) by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture, (C) contained in mortgages, pledges or other security agreements securing Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent restricting the transfer of the property or assets subject thereto, (D) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (E) pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property or assets so acquired, (F) on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, (G) pursuant to customary provisions contained in agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business (including but not limited to leases, sale and leaseback agreements, asset sale agreements and joint venture and other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business), (H) that arises or is agreed to in the ordinary course of business and does not detract from the value of property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, or (I) pursuant to Hedging Obligations; (5) with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition of all or substantially all the Equity Interests or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition; (6) by reason of any applicable law, rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their businesses; or (7) pursuant to an agreement or instrument (A) relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under Limitation on indebtedness (i) if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not less favorable to the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreements (as determined in good faith by the Company), or (ii) if such encumbrance or restriction is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and either (x) the Company determines in good faith that such encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Companys ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior Subordinated Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only if a default occurs in respect of a payment or financial covenant relating to such Indebtedness or (B) of, or relating to Indebtedness of or a Financing Disposition by or to or in favor of, any Special Purpose Entity. 91 Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock The Indenture provides as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless (i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair market value of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition, as such fair market value may be determined (and shall be determined, to the extent such Asset Disposition or any series of related Asset Dispositions involves aggregate consideration in excess of $25.0 million) in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive (including as to the value of all noncash consideration); (ii) in the case of any Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions) having a fair market value of $25.0 million or more, at least 75% of the consideration therefor (excluding, in the case of an Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions), any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, that are not Indebtedness) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash; and (iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) as follows: (A) first, either (x) to the extent the Company elects (or is required by the terms of (1) any Senior Indebtedness, (2) any secured Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or (3) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor), to prepay, repay or purchase any such Indebtedness or (in the case of letters of credit, bankers acceptances or other similar instruments) cash collateralize any such Indebtedness (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 360 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, or (y) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount equal to Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 360 days from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, or, if such investment in Additional Assets is a project authorized by the Board of Directors that will take longer than such 360 days to complete, the period of time necessary to complete such project; (B) second, if the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A) (and after the expiration of the maximum period for such application permitted by clause (A)) above exceeds $20.0 million, (such balance, the Excess Proceeds), to the extent of such Excess Proceeds, to make an offer to purchase Senior Subordinated Notes and (to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, or is required by the terms thereof) to purchase, redeem or repay any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant and subject to the conditions of the Indenture and the agreements governing such other Indebtedness; and (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) above, to fund (to the extent consistent with any other applicable provision of the Indenture) any general corporate purpose (including but not limited to the repurchase, repayment or other acquisition or retirement of any Subordinated Obligations); provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (A)(x) or (B) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such 92 Indebtedness and will cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to apply any Net Available Cash or equivalent amount in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions or equivalent amount that is not applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds $50.0 million. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes or other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary validly tendered and not withdrawn (or otherwise subject to purchase, redemption or repayment) in connection with an offer pursuant to clause (B) above exceeds the Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds will be apportioned between such Senior Subordinated Notes and such other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, with the portion of the Excess Proceeds payable in respect of such Senior Subordinated Notes to equal the lesser of (x) the Excess Proceeds amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such Senior Subordinated Notes and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes and the outstanding principal amount of the relevant other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) the aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn. For the purposes of clause (ii) of paragraph (a) above, the following are deemed to be cash: (1) Temporary Cash Investments and Cash Equivalents, (2) the assumption of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock of the Company) or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition, (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition, (4) securities received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days, (5) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (6) any Designated Noncash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Disposition having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $50.0 million or (y) 1.25% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) above, the Company will be required to purchase Senior Subordinated Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Senior Subordinated Notes (the Offer) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Purchase Date in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the Senior Subordinated Notes tendered pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of Senior Subordinated Notes, the remaining Net Available Cash will be available to the Company for use in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) above (to repay other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) or clause (iii)(C) of paragraph (a) above. The Company shall not be required to make an Offer for Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in clause (iii)(A) of paragraph (a) above) is less than $50.0 million for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount. (c) Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, such Net Available Cash may be applied to temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. 93 (d) To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock covenant, the Company may comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by virtue thereof. The Senior Credit Facility and the Senior Notes will prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness to the purchase of the Senior Subordinated Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Subordinated Notes. In such case, the Companys failure to purchase tendered Senior Subordinated Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If, as a result thereof, a default occurs with respect to any Senior Indebtedness, the subordination provisions in the Indenture would restrict payments to the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates The Indenture provides as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an Affiliate Transaction) unless: (i) such Affiliate Transaction is entered into in good faith and the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are, taken as a whole, fair and reasonable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary; and (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of $25.0 million, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors. For purposes of this paragraph, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this paragraph if (x) such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or (y) in the event there are no Disinterested Directors, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives an opinion in customary form from a nationally recognized appraisal or investment banking firm to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view. (b) The provisions of the preceding paragraph (a) will not apply to: (i) any Restricted Payment Transaction; (ii)(1) the entering into, maintaining or performance of any employment contract, collective bargaining agreement, benefit plan, program or arrangement, related trust agreement or any other similar arrangement for or with any employee, officer or director heretofore or hereafter entered into in the ordinary course of business, including vacation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or other similar plans, programs or arrangements, (2) the payment of compensation, performance of indemnification or contribution obligations, or any issuance, grant or award of stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, to employees, officers or directors in the ordinary course of business, (3) the payment of reasonable fees to directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined in good faith by the Company or such Subsidiary) or (4) Management Advances and payments in respect thereof (or in reimbursement of any expenses referred to in the definition of such term); 94 (iii) any transaction with, including an Investment in, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (iv) any transaction arising out of and any payments made pursuant to agreements or instruments in existence on the Issue Date (other than any Tax Sharing Agreement referred to in clause (b)(vi) of this covenant), including, without limitation, the Transaction Documents, and as the same may be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time so long as such amendment, modification, supplement or replacement is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders than the original agreement or instrument as in effect on the Issue Date; (v) any transaction in the ordinary course of business, or approved by a majority of the Board of Directors, between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company controlled by the Company that is a joint venture or similar entity; (vi) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement; (vii) any issuance or sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company (and the granting of registration rights or other customary rights in connection therewith) or capital contribution to the Company; (viii) transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or Equity Interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, where such Affiliates hold less Indebtedness or Equity Interests than non-Affiliates and such Affiliates receive the same consideration as non-Affiliates in such transactions; (ix) any transaction with any Person who is not an Affiliate immediately before the consummation of such transaction that becomes an Affiliate as a result of such transaction; (x) transactions between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Special Purpose Subsidiary in connection with a Financing Disposition or a Special Purpose Financing, provided that such transactions are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture; (xi) transactions exclusively between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, provided such transactions are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture; (xii) transactions involving aggregate consideration not to exceed $1.0 million; (xiii) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder or any of its affiliates for any financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisition or divestitures, which payments are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors; and (xiv) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or that are on terms at least as favorable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party, or that are considered fair to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the view of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or the senior management of the Company. Limitation on Liens The Indenture provides that the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of its property or assets (including Equity Interests of any other Person), whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, securing any Indebtedness (the Initial Lien), unless contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Indebtedness due under the Indenture and the Senior Subordinated Notes or, in respect of Liens on any Restricted Subsidiarys property or assets, any Subsidiary Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of Subordinated Obligations or Guarantor Subordinated 95 Obligations) such obligation for so long as such obligation is so secured by such Initial Lien. Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Senior Subordinated Notes or any such Subsidiary Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any such Subsidiary Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under Merger and consolidation below) to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company of the property or assets secured by such Initial Lien, or of all of the Equity Interests held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such Initial Lien. Future Subsidiary Guarantors As set forth more particularly under Subsidiary Guarantees, the Indenture provides that the Company will cause each Subsidiary that guarantees payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility or the Senior Notes to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes, whereupon such Subsidiary will become a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes under the Indenture. The Company will also have the right to cause any other Subsidiary so to guarantee payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Subsidiary Guarantees will be subject to release and discharge under certain circumstances prior to payment in full of the Senior Subordinated Notes. See Subsidiary Guarantees. Limitation on Layering The Indenture provides that the Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinate in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is either: (1) equal in right of payment with the Senior Subordinated Notes or such Subsidiary Guarantors Subsidiary Guarantee of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as the case may be; or (2) expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Subordinated Notes or such Subsidiary Guarantors Subsidiary Guarantee of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as the case may be. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or by virtue of the fact that the holders of such Senior Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor or other arrangements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them. SEC Reports The Indenture provides that, following consummation of the exchange offer, notwithstanding that the Company may not be required to be or remain subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will file with the SEC (unless such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act or by the SEC), so long as any Senior Subordinated Notes are outstanding, the annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d) or would be so required to file if the Company were so subject within the time periods specified above. The Company will also, within 15 days after the time periods specified above, transmit by mail to all Holders, as their names and addresses appear in the Note Register, and to the Trustee (or make available on a Company website) copies of any such information, documents and reports (without exhibits) so required to be filed. 96 The Company will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of this covenant if any Parent files with the SEC and provides reports, documents and information of the types otherwise so required, in each case within the applicable time periods specified by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and the Company is not required to file such reports, documents and information separately under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (after giving effect to any exemptive relief) because of the filings by such Parent. The Company will comply with the other provisions of TIA § 314(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirements of this covenant shall be deemed satisfied prior to the commencement of the exchange offer or the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement described in the Registration Rights Agreement (1) by the filing with the SEC of the exchange offer registration statement or shelf registration statement (or any other similar registration statement), and any amendments thereto, with such financial information that satisfies Regulation S-X, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in this prospectus, to the extent filed within the times specified above, or (2) by posting on the Companys website (or that of any of its parent companies) or providing such reports to the Trustee within 15 days after the time periods specified above, the financial information (including a Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section) that would be required to be included in such reports, subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of financial information in this prospectus. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be deemed to have failed to comply with any of its agreements set forth under this covenant for purposes of clause (v) under Defaults until 120 days after the date any report required to be provided by this covenant is due. Merger and Consolidation The Indenture provides that the Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless: (i) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the Successor Company) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume all the obligations of the Company under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Indenture by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture or one or more other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default will have occurred and be continuing; (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (A) the Successor Company could Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (a) of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, or (B) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of the Company (or, if applicable, the Successor Company with respect thereto) would equal or exceed the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; (iv) each Subsidiary Guarantor (other than (x) any Subsidiary Guarantor that will be released from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee in connection with such transaction and (y) any party to any such consolidation or merger) shall have delivered a supplemental indenture or other document or instrument in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming its Subsidiary Guarantee (other than any Subsidiary Guarantee that will be discharged or terminated in connection with such transaction); and (v) the Company will have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer complies with the provisions described in this covenant, provided that (x) in giving such opinion such counsel may assume compliance with the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) to the extent such opinion would otherwise be required to address financial matters or 97 tests and, as to any matters of fact, may rely on an Officers Certificate, and (y) no Opinion of Counsel will be required for a consolidation, merger or transfer described in the last paragraph of this covenant. Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness. The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture, and thereafter the predecessor Company shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Indenture, except that the predecessor Company in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph of this Merger and Consolidation covenant will not apply to any transaction in which (1) any Restricted Subsidiary consolidates with, merges with or into or conveys or transfers all or part of its assets to the Company or (2) the Company consolidates with or merges with or into or conveys or transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to (x) an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Company in another jurisdiction or changing its legal structure to a corporation or other entity or (y) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company so long as all assets of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction (other than Equity Interests of such Restricted Subsidiary) are owned by such Restricted Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately after the consummation thereof. Defaults An Event of Default is defined in the Indenture as: (i) a default in any payment of interest on any Note when due, continued for 30 days, whether or not such payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Indenture; (ii) a default in the payment of principal of any Note when due, whether at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, whether or not such payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Indenture; (iii) the failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with its obligations under the first paragraph of the covenant described under Merger and Consolidation above; (iv) the failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply for 30 days after notice with any of its obligations under the covenant described under Change of Control above (other than a failure to purchase Senior Subordinated Notes); (v) the failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the Senior Subordinated Notes or the Indenture; (vi) the failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay any Indebtedness within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, if the total amount of such Indebtedness so unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary, or of other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries but would in the aggregate constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single Person (the bankruptcy provisions); (viii) the rendering of any judgment or decree for the payment of money in an amount (net of any insurance or indemnity payments actually received in respect thereof prior to or within 60 days from the entry thereof, or to 98 be received in respect thereof in the event any appeal thereof shall be unsuccessful) in excess of $50.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary, or jointly and severally against other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries but would in the aggregate constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single Person, that is not discharged, or bonded or insured by a third Person, if such judgment or decree remains outstanding for a period of 60 days following such judgment or decree and is not discharged, waived or stayed (the judgment default provision); or (ix) the failure of any Subsidiary Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof or of the Indenture) or the denial or disaffirmation in writing by any applicable Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary of its obligations under the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee. The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a Default under clause (iv) or (v) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clause after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all Senior Subordinated Notes to be due and payable; provided, however, that so long as any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture as part of the Senior Credit Facility or any series of Senior Notes shall be outstanding, no such acceleration shall be effective until the earlier of: (1) acceleration of any such Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility and the Senior Notes; or (2) five Business Days after the giving of written notice of such acceleration to the Company and the administrative agent under the Senior Credit Facility and the trustee under any Senior Notes. Upon the effectiveness of such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Senior Subordinated Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes and its consequences. In the event of any Default or Event of Default specified in clause (vi) above, such Default or Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Subordinated Notes) shall not be deemed to have occurred and shall be annulled, waived and rescinded automatically, in each case, without any action by the Trustee or the Holders if, within 20 days after such Event of Default arose, (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers 99 under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes unless (i) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense, (iv) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under either Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium (if any) or interest on, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Noteholders. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default occurring during the previous year. The Company also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after an Officer of the Company becomes aware of the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event that would constitute a Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Amendments and Waivers Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes then outstanding and any past Default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes then outstanding (including in each case, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Senior Subordinated Notes). However, without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Note affected, no amendment or waiver may (i) reduce the principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment or waiver, (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note, (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note, (iv) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note, or change the date at which any Note may be redeemed as described under Optional Redemption above, (v) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note, (vi) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holders Senior Subordinated Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holders Senior Subordinated Notes, (vii) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations under the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (viii) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions described in this sentence. In addition, any amendment to, or waiver of, the provisions of the Indenture relating to subordination that adversely affect the rights of the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will require the consent of the Holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes then outstanding. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and (as applicable) any Subsidiary Guarantor may amend the Indenture to cure or reform any ambiguity, mistake, manifest error, omission, defect or 100 inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by a successor of the obligations of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture, to provide for uncertificated Senior Subordinated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior Subordinated Notes, to add Guarantees with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes, to secure the Senior Subordinated Notes, to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Senior Subordinated Notes when such release, termination or discharge is provided for under the Indenture, to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Noteholders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company, to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Senior Subordinated Notes, to conform the text of the Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee to any provision of this Description of Senior Subordinated Notes, to increase the minimum denomination of Senior Subordinated Notes to equal the dollar equivalent of 1 ,000 rounded up to the nearest $1 ,000 (including for purposes of redemption or repurchase of any Note in part), to provide additional rights or benefits to the Holders or make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder, to release a Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee or the Indenture in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, to provide for the appointment of a successor trustee, provided that the successor trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of the Indenture, or to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA or otherwise. The consent of the Noteholders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or waiver. Until an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Noteholder is a continuing consent by such Noteholder and every subsequent Holder of all or part of the related Note. Any such Noteholder or subsequent holder may revoke such consent as to its Note by written notice to the Trustee or the Company, received thereby before the date on which the Company certifies to Trustee that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes have consented to such amendment or waiver. After an amendment or waiver under the Indenture becomes effective, the Company is required to mail to Noteholders a notice briefly describing such amendment or waiver. However, the failure to give such notice to all Noteholders, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment or waiver. Defeasance The Company at any time may terminate all its obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Indenture (legal defeasance), except for certain obligations, including those relating to the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Senior Subordinated Notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Subordinated Notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Company at any time may terminate its obligations under certain covenants under an Indenture, including the covenants described under Certain Covenants and Change of Control, the operation of the default provisions relating to such covenants described under Defaults above, the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Subsidiaries and the judgment default provision described under Defaults above, and the limitations contained in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) under Merger and Consolidation above (covenant defeasance). If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee and any security then securing the Senior Subordinated Notes will be automatically released. The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (iv), (v) (as it relates to the covenants described under Certain Covenants above), (vi), (vii), (but only with respect to events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of a 101 Subsidiary), (viii) or (ix) under Defaults above or because of the failure of the Company to comply with clause (iii), (iv) or (v) under Merger and Consolidation above. Either defeasance option may be exercised prior to any redemption date or to the maturity date for the Senior Subordinated Notes. In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the defeasance trust) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, sufficient (without reinvestment) to pay principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Senior Subordinated Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel (x) must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable Federal income tax law since the Issue Date and (y) need not be delivered if all Senior Subordinated Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable, will become due and payable at its Stated Maturity within one year, or are to be called for redemption within one year, under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company). Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes when (i) either (a) all Senior Subordinated Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Subordinated Notes, and certain Senior Subordinated Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all Senior Subordinated Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and payable, (y) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (z) have been or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (ii) the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, sufficient (without reinvestment) to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Subordinated Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to, but not including, the date of redemption or their Stated Maturity, as the case may be; (iii) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture by the Company; and (iv) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the Satisfaction and Discharge section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of such Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officers Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)). No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Incorporators and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator, equity holder, member or stockholder of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any thereof shall have any liability for any obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, any such obligation or its creation. Each Noteholder, by accepting the Senior Subordinated Notes, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Subordinated Notes. 102 Concerning the Trustee Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the Trustee under the Indenture and is appointed by the Company as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of such persons own affairs. The Indenture and the TIA will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received by it in respect of any such claims, as security or otherwise. Each Trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions; provided, that if it acquires any conflicting interest as described in the TIA, it must eliminate such conflict, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as Trustee with such conflict, or resign. Transfer and Exchange A Noteholder may transfer or exchange Senior Subordinated Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the registrar and the Trustee may require such Noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Company may require such Noteholder to pay any taxes or other governmental charges required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or purchase or to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 Business Days prior to the day of the mailing of the notice of redemption or purchase. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the Senior Subordinated Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with the transfer or exchange. The Senior Subordinated Notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes. Governing Law The Indenture provides that it and the Senior Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Global Notes have been deposited with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company (DTC) in New York, New York, and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Except as set forth below, Global Notes may be transferred only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee, in whole and not in part. Except in the limited circumstances described below, beneficial interests in Global Notes may not be exchanged for notes in certificated form and owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form. See Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes. Depository Procedures The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Company takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised the Company that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the Participants) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTCs system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the Indirect Participants). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised the Company that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes for a series of notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes for such series; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems as well. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. 130 Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (Certificated Notes) and will not be considered the registered owners or Holders thereof under the indentures governing the Notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, interest and special interest, if any, on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the applicable indenture. Under the terms of each indenture, the Company and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised the Company that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Company. Neither the Company nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the Company and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTCs procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTCs rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised the Company that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of a given series of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the applicable series of Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under such series of notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the applicable Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. 131 Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. None of the Company, the Trustee or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note of the same series if:  DTC (a) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days of such notice or cessation; or  the Company, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes; or  there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes of the same series upon prior written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the applicable Indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in a Global Note will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). Same Day Settlement and Payment The Company will make payments in respect of the Notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and Special Interest, if any) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee. The Company will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, and Special Interest, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holders registered address. The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTCs Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Company expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised the Company that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTCs settlement date. 132 CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS The following is a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion applies only to a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below) that acquires the Notes at original issuance for cash at the original offer price. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), Treasury Regulations and judicial decisions and administrative interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to investors that hold the Notes as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Furthermore, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to investors in light of their particular circumstances, or to investors subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, such as banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, expatriates, persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code and persons that hold the Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment. Furthermore, this discussion does not address any U.S. federal estate or gift tax consequences or any state, local or foreign tax consequences. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. For purposes of this summary, the term Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of a note that is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) an individual that is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is created or organized under the laws of the United States, any of the States or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary control over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust, or (B) that has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) owns notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership that owns the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them. Interest Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on payments of interest on the Notes provided that (i) such interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States engaged in by the Non-U.S. Holder (or, if certain tax treaties apply, such interest is not attributable to a permanent establishment maintained in the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder) and (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder (A) does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock, (B) is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us directly or constructively through stock ownership, and (C) satisfies certain certification requirements. Such certification requirements will be met if (x) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address, and certifies on IRS Form W-8BEN (or appropriate substitute form), under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person or (y) a securities clearing organization or certain other financial institutions holding the note on behalf of the Non-U.S. Holder certifies on IRS Form W-8IMY, under penalties of perjury, that such certification has been received by it and furnishes us or our paying agent with a copy thereof. In addition, we or our paying agent must not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner of the note is a U.S. person. If interest on the Notes is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by a Non-U.S. Holder, but such Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the other requirements outlined above, interest on the Notes will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable treaty rate). 133 If interest on the Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder, and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States, then the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such interest in the same manner as if such holder were a U.S. person and, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation, may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate). However, any such interest will not be subject to withholding tax if the Non-U.S. Holder delivers to us a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI in order to claim an exemption from withholding tax. As more fully described under Description of the Senior NotesOptional Redemption and Description of the Senior NotesChange of Control and Description of the Senior Subordinated NotesOptional Redemption and Description of the Senior Subordinated NotesChange of Control, upon the occurrence of certain enumerated events, we may be required to make additional payments. Such payments may be treated as interest, subject to the rules described above, or as additional amounts paid for the Notes, subject to the rules described below, as applicable, or as other income subject to United States federal withholding tax. A Non-U.S. Holder that is subject to withholding tax should consult its tax advisor as to whether it can obtain a refund for all or a portion of the amount withheld. Disposition of the Notes Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to gain recognized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Notes. A Non-U.S. Holder also generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such gain unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States, or (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a nonresident alien individual, such holder is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year and certain other conditions are satisfied. In the case described above in (i), gain or loss recognized on the disposition of such notes will generally be subject to U.S. federal income taxation in the same manner as if such gain or loss were recognized by a U.S. person, and, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation, may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate). In the case described above in (ii), the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to 30% tax (or lower applicable treaty rate) on any capital gain recognized on the disposition of the Notes, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding A Non-U.S. Holder generally will be required to comply with certain certification procedures in order to establish that such holder is not a U.S. person in order to avoid backup withholding with respect to payments of principal and interest on the Notes. In addition, we must report annually to the IRS and to each Non-U.S. Holder the amount of any interest paid to such Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. Payments of the proceeds from a disposition by a Non-U.S. Holder of a Note made to or through a foreign office of a broker will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding, except that information reporting (but generally not backup withholding) may apply to those payments if the broker is:  a United States person;  a controlled foreign corporation for United States federal income tax purposes;  a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with a United States trade or business for a specified three-year period; or  a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year, one or more of its partners are United States persons, as defined in Treasury regulations, who in the aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interest in the partnership or if, at any time during its tax year, the foreign partnership is engaged in a United States trade or business. 134 Payment of the proceeds from a disposition by a Non-U.S. Holder of a Note made to or through the United States office of a broker is generally subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the holder or beneficial owner certifies as to its taxpayer identification number or otherwise establishes an exemption from information reporting and backup withholding. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and the amount of any tax withheld may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against a Non-U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is provided to the IRS. 135 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION This prospectus is to be used by Goldman, Sachs & Co. in connection with offers and sales of the Notes in market-making transactions effected from time to time.

Under the TNBCA, a corporation may pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director who is a party to a proceeding in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding if: (1) the director furnishes the corporation a written affirmation of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct described in the preceding sentence; and (2) the director furnishes the corporation an undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he did not meet the standard of conduct; and (3) a determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification. Unless a corporations articles of incorporation provide otherwise, the corporation may indemnify and advance expenses to an officer, employee or agent of the corporation who is not a director to the same extent as to a director. Section 48-243-101 of the Tennessee Limited Liability Company Act permits an LLC to indemnify an individual made a party to a proceeding because such individual is or was a responsible person against liability incurred in the proceeding if the individual acted in good faith and reasonably believed that such individuals conduct was in the best interest of the LLC or at least not opposed to its best interests; and in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful.

The Charters of Auto Disposal of Chattanooga, Inc. and Auto Disposal of Nashville, Inc. provide that the corporation shall indemnify its officers if such individuals conduct was in good faith and, when acting in his or her official capacity of the corporation, in what he or she reasonably believed was the corporations best interest or, when acting in all other cases, in what he or she reasonably believed was at least not opposed to the corporations best interest and in addition, in any criminal proceeding, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. The Charters of Auto Disposal of Chattanooga, Inc. and Auto Disposal of Nashville, Inc. further provide that the corporation may advance expenses to its directors, as incurred, in connection with a proceeding so long as such person provides the company with a written affirmation of the persons good faith belief that such person has met the required standard of conduct for indemnification, such person undertakes to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification and a determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under Tennessee laws. Texas Registrants ADESA Texas, Inc. is incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas. ADESA Impact Texas, LLC is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Texas. Under Article 2.02-1 of the Texas Business Corporation Act, or TBCA, subject to the procedures and limitations stated therein, a company may indemnify any person who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding because the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of ours against judgment, penalties (including excise and similar taxes), fines, settlements, and reasonable expenses (including court costs and attorneys fees) actually incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding if it is determined that the person seeking indemnification: (i) acted in good faith; (ii) reasonably believed that his or her conduct was in or at least not opposed to our best interests; and (iii) in the case of a criminal proceeding, has no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. A company is required by Article 2.02-1 of the TBCA to indemnify a director or officer against reasonable expenses (including court costs and attorneys fees) incurred by the director or officer in connection with a proceeding in which the director or officer is a named defendant or respondent because the director or officer is or was in that position if the director or officer has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of the proceeding. The TBCA prohibits a company from indemnifying a director or officer in respect of a proceeding in which the person is found liable to the company or on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received by him or her, other than for reasonable expenses (including court costs and attorneys fees) actually incurred by him or her in connection with the proceeding; provided, that the TBCA further prohibits a company from indemnifying a director or officer in respect of any such proceeding in which the person is found liable for willful or intentional misconduct in the performance of his or her duties. Under Article 2.02-1(J) of the TBCA, a court of competent jurisdiction may order a company to indemnify a director or officer if the court determines that the director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances; however, if the director or officer is found liable to the II-15 company or is found liable on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received by him or her, the indemnification will be limited to reasonable expenses (including court costs and attorneys fees) actually incurred by him or her in connection with the proceeding. Section 2.20 of the Texas Limited Liability Company Act provides that a limited liability company has the power, subject to such standards and restrictions, if any, as are set forth in its articles of organization or regulations, to indemnify members, managers, officers and other persons and purchase insurance for such persons. Section 2.20 further provides that a limited liability company may expand or restrict duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities of such persons. The By-Laws of ADESA Texas, Inc. provide that the corporation shall indemnify its officers, directors and employees if such individuals conduct was in good faith and the individual reasonably believed that his or her conduct was in the best interest of the corporation. The By-Laws further provide that the corporation may advance expenses to its directors, officers and employees in connection with a proceeding so long as such person undertakes to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification and upon a determination that the facts then known would not preclude indemnification.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On April 20, 2007, we issued 106,566,410 shares of our common stock (which reflects a June 14, 2007 stock split in the form of a stock dividend pursuant to which 0.00303915 shares of common stock were issued with respect to each share of common stock issued and outstanding) to KAR Holdings II, LLC in exchange for approximately $1.1 billion in equity, consisting of approximately $790.0 million in cash and ADESA, Inc. stock and approximately $272.4 million of equity interest in Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc. On June 15, 2007, we issued 296,750 shares of our common stock to certain management and outside members of KAR Holdings II, LLC in exchange for approximately $3.0 million. Such issuances did not involve a public offering and accordingly were exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to the exemption provided by II-16 Section 4(2) of the Securities Act because we did not offer or sell the securities by any form of general solicitation or general advertising, informed each purchaser that the securities had not been registered under the Securities Act and were subject to restrictions on transfer, and made offers only to accredited investors within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D and a limited number of sophisticated investors, each of whom we believed had the knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the securities and had access to the kind of information registration would provide.

To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. 2. That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 3. To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 4. That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however , that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 5. That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; II-36 (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. 6. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. II-37 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the city of Carmel, State of Indiana, on April 13, 2010.
