Because this is a summary, it may not contain all of the information that you should consider before receiving a distribution of our common stock. You should read this entire prospectus carefully. We are a development stage company that has only recently begun operations. We have not generated any revenues from our intended business activities, and we do not expect to generate revenues in the near future. We may never generate revenues. We have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. CORPORATE BACKGROUND Easy Energy, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 17, 2007. We have not generated any revenue to date and are a development stage company. We currently have no employees other than our President and Secretary who are also our only board members. We plan to develop a novel, man-powered charger solution for the problems related to the ongoing power requirements of small hand-carried battery-powered personal electronic devices. On August 20, 2007 we filed a patent application (Application No.: 11/841,046) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Prior to our incorporation, Mr. Guy Ofir, our President and Director developed a prototype of the patent. On January 29, 2008 we announced on the completion of the fully working prototype of the man-powered charger solution for battery powered small hand-carried devices. The Company's principal business plan is to manufacture and market the product and / or seek third party entities interested in licensing the rights to manufacture and market the man-powered charger. Our target market will be consumers of disposable and rechargeable batteries, those who heavily depend on their portable devices, especially cell phone users, and those who are looking for "green" energy sources. Our principal executive office is located at Suite 105 - 5348 Vegas Dr., Las Vegas, NV 89108. Our telephone number is +1 (702) 442-1166. We do not have any subsidiaries. The address of our resident agent is Eastbiz.com Inc, 5348 Vegas Dr, Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.A., 89108. Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on our audited financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2008 our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. NUMBER OF SHARES BEING OFFERED This prospectus covers the resale by the selling stockholders named in this prospectus of up to 20,638,273 shares of our common stock. The offered shares were acquired by the selling stockholders in several private placement transactions. All of these transactions were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The selling stockholders may offer to sell the shares of common stock being offered in this prospectus at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at varying prices or at negotiated prices. Our common stock is presently traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol "ESYE". Please see the Plan of Distribution section at page 11 of this prospectus for a detailed explanation of how the common shares may be sold. NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING There were 93,186,070 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as at April 22, 2008. USE OF PROCEEDS We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common stock being offered for sale by the selling stockholders, although we may receive proceeds of up to $3,937,949 if all of warrants are exercised. We will incur all costs associated with this registration statement and prospectus. 1 SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL DATA The summary financial data presented below is derived from and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements from May 17, 2007 (date of inception) to March 31, 2008, including the notes to those financial statements which are included elsewhere in this prospectus along with the section entitled "Plan of Operation" beginning on page 21 of this prospectus. As at BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION March 31, 2008 ------------------------- -------------- Cash $ 725,747 Total Assets $ 889,571 Liabilities $ 300 From May 17, 2007 (date of inception) to STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS INFORMATION March 31, 2008 ----------------------------------- -------------- Working Capital $ 725,747 Expenses $ 347,554 Total Number of Issued Shares of Common Stock 93,186,070 Net Gain (Loss) $ 324,942 2 RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this prospectus in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our company's common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OUR SUCCESS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to obtain trademarks and patents. We have recently submitted provisional patent applications, but we cannot ensure that any patents will issue from those applications. We cannot assure you that the patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted under those registrations will provide competitive advantages to us. We also rely on trade secrets and new technologies to maintain our competitive position. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants, we cannot be certain that others will not gain access to these trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO LIABILITY FOR INFRINGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHER COMPANIES. Our success will, in part, depend on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Although we have conducted searches and are not aware of any patents and trademarks which our products or their use might infringe, we cannot be certain that infringement has not or will not occur. We could incur substantial costs, in addition to the great amount of time lost, in defending any patent or trademark infringement suits or in asserting any patent or trademark rights, in a suit with another. WE HAVE NO OPERATING HISTORY AND HAVE MAINTAINED LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE. We were incorporated on May 17, 2007, and have very limited operations to date. We have not realized any revenues to date. Our product is under development and is not ready for commercial sale. We have no operating history at all upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our net loss from inception to March 31, 2008 is $324,942. Based upon our proposed plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods. This will happen because there are substantial costs and expenses associated with the development, testing and marketing of our website. We currently believe we are at least 8-10 months away from generating our first revenues. We may fail to generate revenues in the future. If we cannot attract a significant number of users, we will not be able to generate any significant revenues or income. Failure to generate revenues will cause us to go out of business because we will not have the money to pay our ongoing expenses. In particular, additional capital may be required in the event that: - the actual expenditures required to be made are at or above the higher range of our estimated expenditures; - we incur unexpected costs in completing the development of our product or encounter any unexpected technical or other difficulties; - we incur delays and additional expenses as a result of technology failure; - we are unable to create a substantial market for our product; or - we incur any significant unanticipated expenses. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events could adversely affect our ability to meet our business plans and achieve a profitable level of operations. 3 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCING TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN WE WILL NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY OUR ONGOING EXPENSES AND WE MAY GO OUT OF BUSINESS. Our budgeted expenditures for the next twelve months are $727,000. We prepaid $200,000 for our research and development and $50,000 in Consulting Fees and we anticipate needing approximately $21,182.50 for expenses associated with this Registration Statement (See ITEM 13 "Other Expenses if Issuance and Distribution"). Therefore, we presently have a budgeted shortfall of $1,253. Because we have not generated any revenue from our business, and we are 10-12 months away from being in a position to generate revenues, we will need to raise additional funds for the future development of our business and to respond to unanticipated requirements or expenses. Management estimates that our current cash balances will be exhausted by April 2009 provided we do not have any unanticipated expenses. We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and we can provide no assurance to investors we will be able to find such financing. Our ability to successfully develop our product and to eventually produce and sell it to generate operating revenues depends on our ability to obtain the necessary financing to implement our business plan. Given that we have no operating history, no revenues and only losses to date, we may not be able to achieve this goal, and if this occurs we will not be able to pay for our operations and we may go out of business. We will likely need to issue additional equity securities in the future to raise the necessary funds. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing and we can provide no assurance to investors we will be able to find such financing if further funding is required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including investor acceptance of our product and our business model. The issuance of additional equity securities by us would result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. The resale of shares by our existing shareholders pursuant to this prospectus may result in significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock and cause negative impact on our ability to sell additional equity securities. Obtaining loans will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There can be no assurance that capital will continue to be available if necessary to meet future funding needs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable to us, we may be forced to scale back or cease operations, which might result in the loss of some or all of your investment in our common stock. IF OUR ESTIMATES RELATED TO EXPENDITURES ARE ERRONEOUS OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL AND YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Our success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our management's estimates of expenditures, which are currently budgeted at $727,000 for the next 12 months for our business plan and an additional $21,182.50. (See "Plan of Operation".) If such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate we may not be able to carry out our business plan, which could, in a worst-case scenario, result in the failure of our business and you losing your entire investment. OUR BUSINESS MODEL MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE OUR SUCCESS IN OUR INTENDED MARKET Our survival is currently dependent upon the success of our efforts to gain market acceptance of one product that ultimately represents a small sector in the overall charger industry. Should our services be too narrowly focused or should the target market not be as responsive as we anticipate, we may not have in place alternate products or services that we can offer to ensure our survival. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE REVENUES AND YOU WILL LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT. We have not completed the development of our proposed product and we have no contracts or licenses for the sale or use of our product. The success of our proposed business will depend on its completion and the acceptance of our product by the general public. Achieving such acceptance will require significant marketing investment. Our product, once developed and tested, may not be accepted by our customers at sufficient levels to support our operations and build our business. If the proposed product that we will develop is not accepted at sufficient levels, our business will fail. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON REVENUES GENERATED BY A SOLE PRODUCT AND THUS WE ARE SUBJECT TO MANY ASSOCIATED RISKS 4 Our revenue will be generated through the sale of our man-powered charger. Unless we expand our product offerings to include related or other products, our likely source of revenues for the foreseeable future will continue to be generated by the man-powered charger. Accordingly, 100% of our revenue will be dependent upon the sale of our sole product. If potential users are satisfied with other means for charging their cell phone battery we may not be able to sell our product. * If technological developments render man-powered charger obsolete, our business could fail * our patent application is unsuccessful, our business could fail Thus, we may expand our financial resources on marketing and advertising without generating concomitant revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to cover our overhead, manufacturing and operating costs, we will fail. THERE ARE LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY INTO THE MAN-POWERED CHARGER INDUSTRY AND, AS A RESULT, MANY COMPANIES MAY BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH US ON LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. Our product does not require large capital expenditures for the development or manufacture. As a result, barriers to entering this industry may be low. If the intellectual property protection with respect to the man-powered charger product does not prove effective, a competitor with limited financial resources may be able to successfully compete with us. BECAUSE OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU MAY HAVE NO EFFECTIVE RECOURSE AGAINST THEM FOR MISCONDUCT AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE JUDGMENT AND CIVIL LIABILITIES AGAINST THEM. INVESTORS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES TO THE VALUE OF THEIR INVESTMENT CAUSED BY WRONGFUL ACTIONS BY OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Both of our directors and officers live outside of the United States. Mr. Guy Ofir, our President and a director is a national and a resident of Israel, and all or a substantial portion of his assets are located outside of the United States. Mr. Emanuel Cohen, our Secretary, Treasurer and director is a national and a resident of Israel, and all or a substantial portion of his assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against our directors or officers, or obtain judgments against them outside of the United States that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. Investors may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of their investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers. BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO DIRECTORS, DEADLOCKS MAY OCCUR IN OUR BOARD'S DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, WHICH MAY DELAY OR PREVENT CRITICAL DECISIONS FROM BEING MADE. Since we currently only have an even number of directors, deadlocks may occur when such directors disagree on a particular decision or course of action. Our Articles and By-Laws do not contain any mechanisms for resolving potential deadlocks. While our directors are under a duty to act in the best interest of our company, any deadlocks may impede the further development of our business in that such deadlocks may delay or prevent critical decisions regarding our development. BECAUSE OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE EMPLOYED ELSEWHERE, THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO DEVOTE THEIR SERVICES TO OUR COMPANY ON A FULL TIME BASIS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER, OUR BUSINESS COULD FAIL AND INVESTORS COULD LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Mr. Guy Ofir, our President and director is employed elsewhere and he will be unable to devote his services to our company on a full time basis. Mr. Guy Ofir currently devotes approximately 30 to 40 hours a week to our company. Mr. Emanuel Cohen, our Secretary, Treasurer and a director, is employed elsewhere and he will be unable to devote his services to our company on a full time basis. Mr. Emanuel Cohen currently devotes 15 to 20 hours a week to our company. 5 As a result, the management of our company could under-perform, our business could fail and investors could lose their entire investment. OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE NO EXPERIENCE OR TECHNICAL TRAINING IN THE DEVELOPMENT, MAINTENANCE AND MARKETING OF MAN-POWERED CHARGER OR IN OPERATING BUSINESSES THAT SELL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO WHOLESALES. THIS COULD CAUSE THEM TO MAKE INEXPERIENCED OR UNINFORMED DECISIONS THAT HAVE BAD RESULTS FOR OUR COMPANY. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM AND MAY CAUSE US TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE INVESTORS TO LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Mr. Guy Ofir, our President and director and Mr. Emanuel Cohen, our Secretary, Treasurer and director, have no experience or technical training in the development, maintenance and marketing of man-powered charger or in operating businesses that sell products or services to wholesales. Due to their lack of experience and knowledge in these areas, our executive officers could make the wrong decisions regarding the development, operation and marketing of our website and the operation of our business, which could lead to irreparable damage to our business. Consequently, our operations could suffer irreparable harm from mistakes made by our executive officers and we may have to suspend or cease operations, which could cause investors to lose their entire investment. WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON MR. GUY OFIR AND MR. EMANUEL COHEN. THE LOSS OF EITHER PERSON WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND MAY CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL. We depend entirely on Mr. Ofir and Mr. Cohen for all of our operations. The loss of either person will have a substantial negative effect on the company and may cause our business to fail. Our officers did not receive any compensation for their services and it is highly unlikely that they will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officers. If our officers do not devote sufficient time towards our business, we may never be able to effectuate our business plan. BECAUSE OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS CONTROL A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE MATTERS AFFECTING OUR SHAREHOLDERS. Our executive officers, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 49.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, they have the ability to influence matters affecting our shareholders, including the election of our directors, the acquisition or disposition of our assets, and the future issuance of our shares. Because our executive officers control such shares, investors may find it difficult to replace our management if they disagree with the way our business is being operated. WE HAVE A GOING CONCERN OPINION FROM OUR AUDITORS, INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. The Company has incurred net losses of $324,942 for the period from May 17, 2007 (inception) to March 31, 2008. We anticipate generating losses for the next 12 months. Therefore, we may be unable to continue operations in the future as a going concern. No adjustment has been made in the accompanying financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities which could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company. OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FUTURE FINANCING. For the period from May 17, 2007 (inception) to March 31, 2008, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such doubt was expressed as a result of our recurring losses and cash flow deficiencies since our inception. We continue to experience net losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, 6 future sales of our product or obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions whenever possible. If we continue to incur losses, it will become increasingly difficult for us to achieve our goals and there can be no assurance that our business plan will materialize. WE WILL BE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON CONTRACTING WITH THIRD PARTIES FIRM(S) TO MANUFACTORE COMPONENTS FOR US. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN THESE FIRM(S), OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL. We intend to hire a third parties firm(s) to manufacture the components of our product. Should we be unable to contract qualified third parties firm(s) to manufacture because we can't find them, can't attract them to our company or can't afford them, we will never become profitable and our business will fail. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMMON STOCK BECAUSE WE CAN ISSUE ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES, PURCHASERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY INCUR IMMEDIATE DILUTION AND MAY EXPERIENCE FURTHER DILUTION. We are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000,000 common shares, of which 93,186,070 are issued and outstanding. Our board of directors has the authority to cause our company to issue additional shares of common stock without the consent of any of our shareholders. Consequently, our shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership of our company in the future. A DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FURTHER WORKING CAPITAL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because a significant portion of our operations has been and will be financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations. The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS, WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in 7 writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. NASD SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY ALSO LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. In addition to the "penny stock" rules described above, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the NASD believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The NASD requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. OUR COMMON STOCK IS ILLIQUID AND THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY FACTORS WHICH ARE UNRELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS. Our common stock currently trades on a limited basis on the OTC Bulletin Board. Trading of our stock through the OTC Bulletin Board is frequently thin and highly volatile. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in the stock, in which case it could be difficult for shareholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of our competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock. WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ANY INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF STOCK OF OUR COMPANY AND THERE WILL BE FEWER WAYS FOR INVESTORS TO MAKE A GAIN ON ANY INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY. We have never paid any cash dividends and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may prohibit the payment of a dividend. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our company will need to come through an increase in the stock's price. This may never happen and investors may lose all of their investment in our company. 8 PLEASE READ THIS PROSPECTUS CAREFULLY. YOU SHOULD RELY ONLY ON THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS.

The selling shareholders are not required to sell their shares. (1) "Prior to this Offering" means prior to the offering by the selling stockholders of the securities registered under this prospectus for resale. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The selling stockholders may, from time to time, sell all or a portion of the shares of common stock on any market upon which the common stock may be listed or quoted (currently the National Association of Securities Dealers OTC Bulletin Board in the United States), in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such sales may be at fixed prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the market prices or at negotiated prices. The distribution of such shares may be effected by the selling stockholders in one or more of the following methods: * ordinary brokers transactions, which may include long or short sales, * transactions involving cross or block trades on any securities or market where our common stock is trading, * purchases by brokers, dealers or underwriters as principal and resale by such purchasers for their own accounts pursuant to this prospectus, "at the market" to or through market makers or into an existing market for the common stock, * in other ways not involving market makers or established trading markets, including direct sales to purchasers or sales effected through agents, * through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether exchange listed or otherwise), or * any combination of the foregoing. 11 In addition, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers who may engage in short sales, if short sales were permitted, of shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with the selling shareholders. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers that require the delivery by such broker-dealers of the shares, which shares may be resold thereafter pursuant to this prospectus. Brokers, dealers, underwriters or agents participating in the distribution of the shares may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling shareholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal, or both (which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer may be in excess of customary commissions). The selling shareholders and any broker-dealers acting in connection with the sale of the shares hereunder may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, and any commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on the resale of shares as principals may be deemed underwriting compensation under the Securities Act of 1933. The amount of such compensation cannot be estimated at this time. We know of no existing arrangements between the selling shareholders and any other shareholder, broker, dealer, underwriter or agent relating to the sale or distribution of the shares. We can provide no assurance that all or any of the common stock offered will be sold by the selling stockholders named in this prospectus. The estimated costs of this Offering are $21,182.50. We are bearing all costs relating to the registration of the common stock. The selling stockholders, however, will pay any commissions or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the common stock. The selling stockholders named in this prospectus must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in the offer and sale of the common stock. The selling stockholders and any broker-dealers who execute sales for the selling stockholders may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In particular, during such times as the selling stockholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and may among other things: 1. Not engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our common stock; 2. Furnish each broker or dealer through which common stock may be offered, such copies of this prospectus, as amended from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer; and 3. Not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities other than as permitted under the Exchange Act. If an underwriter is selected in connection with this Offering, an amendment will be filed to identify the underwriter, disclose the arrangements with the underwriter, and we will file the underwriting agreement as an exhibit to this prospectus. The selling stockholders should be aware that the anti-manipulation provisions of Regulation M under the Exchange Act will apply to purchases and sales of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders, and that there are restrictions on market-making activities by persons engaged in the distribution of the shares. Under Regulation M, the selling stockholders or their agents may not bid for, purchase, or attempt to induce any person to bid for or purchase, shares of our common stock while such selling stockholder is distributing shares covered by this prospectus. Accordingly, the selling stockholders are not permitted to cover short sales by purchasing shares while the distribution is taking place. The selling stockholders are advised that if a particular offer of common stock is to be made on terms constituting a material change from the information set forth above with respect to the Plan of Distribution, then, to the extent required, a post-effective amendment to the accompanying registration statement must be filed with the SEC. INTEREST OF NAMED EXPERTS AND COUNSEL No expert or counsel named in this prospectus as having prepared or certified any part of this prospectus or having given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered or upon other legal matters in connection with the registration or offering of the common stock was employed on a contingency basis or had, or is to receive, in connection with the offering, a substantial interest, directly or indirectly, in the registrant. Nor was any such person connected with the registrant as a promoter, managing or principal underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer or employee. 12 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY We are a development stage company in the business of developing battery charging solutions for small hand-carried devices. We were incorporated on May 17, 2007 in the State of Nevada. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. OBJECTIVES Our product is a man-powered generator for recharging cellular phones and small batteries. We plan to develop a palm-sized device intended to provide a quick recharge for cell phones and other personal electronic devices operating on AA or AAA batteries. Prior to incorporation our President and Director, Mr. Guy Ofir, started developing a prototype of the man-powered generator. We will focus our efforts on developing a product that will be rugged enough to withstand constant use. It will be shockproof with a suspension system that maintains the unit in an available state of readiness but not in the user's way. We plan to keep the controls of the product as user-friendly as possible with the design of the casing intended to appeal to personal electronic gadget-lovers in general and more specifically to the younger market segment which is the largest consumer of disposable batteries. Our President and Director, Mr. Guy Ofir, purchased the rights to the design and the patent application in a private transaction. Mr. Guy Ofir transferred those rights to the company at no cost to us. We plan to complete the development of the man-powered charger solution for battery powered small hand-carried devices. On August 20, 2007 we filed a patent application (Application No.: 11/841,046) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company's principal business plan is to complete the development of the prototype and then manufacture and market the product and seek third party entities interested in licensing the rights to manufacture and market the man-powered charger. To enable the power capability and provide minutes of operation without fatigue the device will generate 20 watts of peak power for each cord pull. It is designed as a very low profile device fitting into the overall size of 45mm x 70mm x 18mm. A novel design uses a combination of a permanent magnet disk rotor and integrated stator coils without an iron core and an attached mechanical drive contribute to the high power and efficiency of the generator. To keep the unit flat, a simple speed multiplication concept is designed instead of complex gear mechanism. Furthermore, the magnitude of the inertia extends the effective generation cycle after the pulling cycle has ceased, thus making for more effective charging. Designed as a belt attachment, it can be operated with either hand, adding further to its ergonomics capabilities by dividing and lowering the required human strength. Our Secretary, Treasurer and Director, Mr. Emanuel Cohen, will be in charge of minimizing the size of our product and complete a series of quality tests. Our product package will consist of a disk generator and the mechanical system to activate it, an intermittent accumulator battery, an electronic system, a strong protective casing and a strap for suspending it from a belt. In the future, if we generate revenue from the sale of our man-powered slim charger, we plan to sell accessories such as adapters for common hand-held electrical devices. 13 TECHNICAL BRIEF: Controls for safe charging/ Applicable for State of up-scaling Time to recharge 10% Ease of usage internal and for larger Power capacity of typical 1000 Ergonomic external battery application Autonomy Level Capability mA/hr Li-ion Battery design indications laptops - -------------- ---------- -------------------- ------ ----------- ------- Complete autonomy 20 watts max 6-10 minutes Ergonomic Internal and Yes + wall charger from the device internal design for arm external Tandem design of battery pulling. batteries 2 generators charging with common ~ 2 minutes to replace Belt attached indicating shaft will the energy in the to enable LEDS produce up to internal battery by single hand 40 watts the hand generator charging MARKETING STRATEGY We plan to market our product in the United States by establishing a network of wholesalers who can promote our product to the retail market such as 7-Eleven, Wal-Mart and other high-traffic locations and points-of-sale which cater to electronic accessories such as Office Depot, Radio Shack and Circuit City. We plan to offer our product at a comparable price to other re-charging systems, we will stress advantages such as clean energy source, use with a wide array of products and dependability. The end-user should be able to purchase a unit for $30 to $50 depending on packaging and features. Our President and Director, Mr. Guy Ofir, will be in charge of executing the marketing plan. We have budgeted $200,000 for this purpose. THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY Our target market consists of the following market segments: CELLULAR PHONES Cellular phone users are our main initial market. According to iSuppli, a reliable source of data on the industry, who report that global mobile phone subscriber growth increased an average of 25 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and forecasts that it will decelerate to 12.8 percent in 2007. They estimate there were 2.7 billion cellular subscribers globally in 2006 and forecasts about 3 billion subscribers by end of 2007. The market will reach 1.085 billion units in 2007. See http://www.isuppli.com/whyisuppli2/index.asp LAPTOPS AND NOTEBOOKS iSuppli predicts global PC shipments will rise to 264 million units in 2007, up 11.2 percent from 239 million in 2006, with notebooks to account for almost 40 percent of total 2007 PC market shipments. Based on 2004-2006 PC and notebook growth rate we calculated the installed base for notebooks to the end of 2007 to be about 300 million units. Source: http://www.isuppli.com/NEWS/default.asp?id=8059&m=6&y=2007 MOBILE HAND HELD COMPUTERS: PDAS, GPS DEVICES, AND SMART PHONES The main growth is in Converged Mobile Devices - smart phones where RIM's BlackBerry is the leading product. According to IDC Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, February 2007 report, total units shipped in 2005 and 2006 were 56.7 and 80.5 million units, as quoted in http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/9277/converged-mobile-device-market-grows-42- in-2006/. Although probably counted in the overall cellular market, this enterprise-focused market will require special marketing attention. DIGITAL STILL CAMERAS AND CAMCORDERS About 81.9 million stand-alone digital still cameras are expected to be sold worldwide in 2007, a 7% increase from 76.6 million cameras in 2006, according to IC Insights' new report. http://photoshopnews.com/2006/12/04/digital-still- camera-market-pauses-at-18-billion-plateau/ 14 In a report by IDC, digital camera sales will grow 8 percent to hit 114 million units in 2007. Based on these reports the current installed base of still digital cameras is about 360 million units and it will reach about 680 million units in 2010 as quoted in a C-net story dated 26 April 2007: http://www.cnet.com.au/digitalcameras/cameras/0,239036184,339275089,00.htm Based on the US figures and forecasts for camcorders in 2005 through 2007 as stated in "Twice" magazine 1/29/2007 totaling about 14 million units, we extrapolated a world installed camcorder market of about 50 to 60 million units. http://www.twice.com/article/CA6410725.html?q=Digital+Foci&q=Digital+Foci&q= Digital+Foci&q=Digital+Foci&q=camcorder+forecast COMPETITION Competition within the re-charger systems industry is intense. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater financial, sales, marketing and technological resources and longer established client relationships than we do. Solutions currently marketed for the problem Easy Energy addresses include several different groups of products, each with its own advantage and disadvantage. Some of our competitors such as EnergizerTM (http://energizer.com/energitogo/index_flash.html) and ZapTM (http://www.zapworld.com/) are using AA or AAA batteries to recharge a cell phone or other devices. Other competitors are using Photovoltaic solar energy such as Shenzhen Rising Sun Eastern Industry Co. (http://sresky.en.alibaba.com/product/50182049/50492428/Solar_Mobile_Charger/ Solar_Mobile_Charger.html) and SolioTM (http://www.solio.com/v2/). Some of our direct competition comes from companies that are using man-powered chargers, companies such as SOSChargerTM (http://www.soscharger.net/) ,AladdinPower(TM) (http://www.aladdinpower.com/main.html) and Ptenco (http://www.potenco.com/home). SOSCharger(TM) has a product designed with a small coffee grinder style handle; AlladingPower(TM) has had a hand-squeeze generator, meant primarily for cellphones, on the market since 2002. Ptenco has a cord pulling mechanism uses the arm muscles to generate energy. We seek to differentiate ourselves by providing a slimmer and lighter generator at a competitive price.

Our future dividend policy will be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. To the extent that we require additional funding our funding sources may prohibit the payment of a dividend. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our company will need to come through an increase in the stock's price, which may never happen.

We plan to develop a man-powered charger solution for battery powered small hand-carried devices. On August 20, 2007 we filed a patent application (Application No.: 11/841,046) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Prior to our incorporation, Mr. Guy Ofir, Our President and Director started developing a prototype of the man-powered generator. On January 29, 2008 we announced on the completion of the fully working prototype of the man-powered charger solution for battery powered small hand-carried devices. The Company's principal business plan is to manufacture and market the product and / or seek third party entities interested in licensing the rights to manufacture and market our product. Our business objectives are: - To complete the design of our product. - To engage third parties firm(s) to manufacture the components of our product. - To set up an assembly line. - To be a leading provider of man-powered charger. - To execute our marketing plan. Our goals over the next 12 months are: - Develop and manufacture a first product suited to cellular phone use. - Explore potential distributors for our product. 17 ESTIMATED EXPENSES FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTH PERIOD: Anticipated Target Date Costs For Completion ----- -------------- PHASE I - COMPLETING THE DEVELOPMENT $100,000* Mar, 2008 - >> R&D activities related to development of our product. May, 2008 >> Minimizing the size of our product. >> Protection of intellectual property rights. PHASE II - MANUFACTURE A PROTOTYPE $300,000** Apr, 2008 - >> Refinement of working prototypes. Jun, 2008 >> Seeking suppliers for the components for our product. >> Set up an assembly line. PHASE III - MARKETING PLAN $200,000 Jul, 2008 - >> Full product release. Apr, 2009 >> Development of marketing plan aimed at specified markets. TOTAL $600,000 12 MONTHS - ---------- * We paid in full. ** Of which we prepaid $100,000. In addition to the costs outlined above, we anticipate that we will incur over the next twelve months the following expenses: Planned Expenditures Over Category The Next Twelve Months -------- ---------------------- Consultant Compensation $100,000*** Legal Fees $ 20,000 Accounting Fees $ 5,000 General and administrative expenses $ 2,000 TOTAL $127,000 - ---------- *** Of which we prepaid $50,000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES To date, we have had negative cash flows from operations and we have been dependent on sales of our equity securities and debt financing to meet our cash requirements. We expect this situation to continue for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will have negative cash flows from operations in the next twelve month period. Our company incurred a loss of $324,942 for the period ended March 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2008, we had working capital of $725,747. As indicated above, our estimated working capital requirements and projected operating expenses for the next twelve month period total $727,000. We anticipate that such funds will not be sufficient to pay our estimated expenses for the next twelve month period. We intend to fulfill any additional cash requirement through the sale of either equity or debt. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain funds required for our continued operation. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business. Given that we are a development stage company and have not generated any revenues to date, our cash flow projections are subject to numerous contingencies and risk factors beyond our control, including market acceptance of our products, competition from well-funded competitors, and our ability to manage our expected growth. We can offer no assurance that our company will generate cash flow sufficient to meet our cash flow projections or that our expenses will not exceed our projections. If our expenses exceed estimates, we will require additional monies during the next twelve months to execute our business plan. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing, successful development of our technologies into a marketable product 18 and successful and sufficient market acceptance of our products once developed and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in significant dilution of the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. GOING CONCERN Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet current operating and capital expenses, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in their audit report for the period ended March 31, 2008. PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT We do not expect to purchase any significant equipment over the twelve months. EMPLOYEES Currently our only employees are our directors and officers. We do not expect any other material changes in the number of employees over the next 12 months. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Our company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, including any outstanding derivative financial statements, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. Our company does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE We engaged the firm of Moore & Associates Chartered to audit our financial statements for the March 31, 2008. There has been no change in the accountants and no disagreements with Moore & Associates Chartered, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope procedure. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS AND CONTROL PERSONS All directors of our company hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or until their successors have been elected and qualified. The executive officers of our company are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until their death, resignation or removal from office. Our directors and executive officers, their ages, positions held, and duration as such, are as follows: Position Held Date First Elected Name with the Company Age or Appointed ---- ---------------- --- ------------ Guy Ofir President and Director 35 May 17, 2007 Emanuel Cohen Secretary, Treasurer and Director 58 May 17, 2007 BUSINESS EXPERIENCE The following is a brief account of the education and business experience of each director and executive officer during at least the past five years, indicating each person's business experience, principal occupation during the period, and the name and principal business of the organization by which they were employed. 19 MR. GUY OFIR Mr. Guy Ofir has been serving as our President and a member of our Board of Directors since May 17, 2007. The term of his office is for one year and is renewable on an annual basis. Mr. Ofir is an attorney and owns a law firm in Israel which specializes in corporate and international law. His law firm employs several lawyers and represents over 100 companies. In addition to his work as a lawyer, he also manages investments and companies in Romania. His main company (Guy Ofir & Co. SRL) deals with land and properties in Bucharest. MR. EMANUEL COHEN Mr. Cohen has been serving as our Secretary, Treasurer and a member of our Board of Directors since May 17, 2007. The term of his office is for one year and is renewable on an annual basis. Mr Cohen is a major shareholder and a director of several privately owned companies in Israel & in the USA. His specialialty includes land, properties & fabrics. (Amitex & Emday Ltd- one of the biggest Israeli fabric companies ). He is also a shareholder in private companies which hold land & properties in Israel. - (Lev Hazom Ltd), (Hafia Zamin Ltd), (Leved Adi Properties Ltd) & (Mashko Ltd). In addition to his activities in Europe & Israel, he is also a shareholder in the following companies which hold land & properties in the USA .- (Echo investments LLC), (Bilou Capital investment LLC) & (Eden Associated LLC). Previously he was an officer in Israel's largest bank, Bank of Israel (Israel Hapoalim Bank). FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS There are no family relationships among our directors or executive officers. INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Our directors, executive officer and control person have not been involved in any of the following events during the past five years: 1. any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 2. any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences'); 3. being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or 4. being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD All proceedings of the board of directors for the year ended December 31, 2007 were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by board of directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the director. Our company currently does not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our sole director believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the board of directors. Our company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The board of directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating 20 such nominees. The sole director on the board of directors, as the case may be, will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President and director, Guy Ofir, at the address appearing on the first page of this prospectus. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT Our board of directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the NASD Rules. We believe that our board of directors is capable of analysing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The board of directors of our company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes that the functions of an audit committee can be adequately performed by the sole director. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations to date. CONFLICT OF INTEREST None of our officers or directors is subject to a conflict of interest. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION No executive officer of our company received an annual salary and bonus that exceeded $100,000 during the period from May 17, 2007 (date of inception) to March 31, 2008.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS We have not entered into any employment agreement or consulting agreements with our directors and executive officers.

Our directors and executive officers may receive stock options at the discretion of our board of directors in the future.

(2) Based on 93,186,070 shares issued and outstanding as of April 22, 2008. 22 CHANGES IN CONTROL We are unaware of any contract, or other arrangement or provision of our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of our company. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS Except as described below, no director, executive officer, principal shareholder holding at least 5% of our common shares, or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction, during the period ended March 31, 2008, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year end for the last three completed fiscal years. On May 17, 2007 Mr. Ofir and Cohen each purchased 20,000,000 shares of our common stock for $0.00005 per share, or $1000 each, for an aggregate of $2000. The promoters of our company are Guy Ofir, our President and director and Emanuel Cohen, our Secretary, Treasurer and director. We have determined that neither Mr. Guy Ofir nor Mr. Emanuel Cohen are independent directors, as that term is used in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. DISCLOSURE OF SEC POSITION OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Our Bylaws provide that we will indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by law. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials. GOING CONCERN BASIS The audited financial statements included with this prospectus have been prepared on the going concern basis which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the audited financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, we require additional financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, we would likely be unable to realize the carrying value of our assets reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the financial statements. 23 EXPERTS The financial statements of Easy Energy included in this registration statement have been audited by Moore & Associates Chartered, to the extent and for the period set forth in their report (which contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our company's ability to continue as a going concern) appearing elsewhere in the registration statement, and are included in reliance upon such report given upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting.

(A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2008 NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on May 17, 2007. The Company has limited operations and in accordance with SFAS #7, is considered a development stage company, and has had no revenues from operations to date. NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING BASIS These financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. EARNINGS PER SHARE In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. SFAS No. 128 supersedes the provisions of APB No. 15, and requires the presentation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 128 effective its inception. The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first of the year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. DIVIDENDS The Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during the periods shown. CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. F-6 Easy Energy Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2008 NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards NO. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. No provision for income taxes is included in the statement due to its immaterial amount, net of the allowance account, based on the likelihood of the Company to utilize the loss carry-forward. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has net losses for the period from inception to March 31, 2008 of $397,544. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. NOTE 4 - DEFERRED OFFERING COSTS - STOCK RELATED On March 10, 2008 the Company entered into agreements relating to the issuance of 882,353 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and a warrant to purchase up to 3,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $0.27 per share. The shares issued to date as part of this agreement have been charged to deferred financing cost until such time the Company exercises its option to demand an additional $1,000,000 of financing from the financer. At such time, the deferred financing charges will be offset against the financing. F-7 Easy Energy Inc.

(A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2008 NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. SFAS No. 109 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company's opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded. The total deferred tax asset is $87,460, which is calculated by multiplying a 22% estimated tax rate by the cumulative NOL of $397,544. NOTE 8 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Below is a listing of the most recent accounting standards SFAS 150-154 and their effect on the Company. STATEMENT NO. 150 - ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY (ISSUED 5/03) This Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. STATEMENT NO. 151- INVENTORY COSTS-AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 43, CHAPTER 4 (ISSUED 11/04) This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, INVENTORY PRICING, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that "...under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight and re-handling costs may be so abnormal ass to require treatment as current period charges...." This Statement requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless oF whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal." In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. F-10 Easy Energy Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2008 NOTE 8 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED) STATEMENT NO. 152 - ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE TIME-SHARING TRANSACTIONS (AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 66 AND 67) This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 66, ACCOUNTING FOR SALES OF REAL ESTATE, to reference the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate time-sharing transactions that is provided in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 04-2, ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE TIME-SHARING TRANSACTIONS. This Statement also amends FASB Statement No. 67, Accounting FOR COSTS AND INITIAL RENTAL OPERATIONS OF REAL ESTATE PROJECTS, states that the guidance for (a) incidental operations and (b) costs incurred to sell real estate projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. The accounting for those operations and costs is subject to the guidance in SOP 04-2. STATEMENT NO. 153- EXCHANGES OF NON-MONETARY ASSETS (AN AMENDMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 29) The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, ACCOUNTING FOR NON-MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, includes certain exceptions to the principle. This Statement amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assts and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. STATEMENT NO. 154 - ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND ERROR CORRECTIONS (A REPLACEMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 20 AND FASB STATEMENT NO. 3) This Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, ACCOUNTING CHANGES, and FASB Statement No. 3, REPORTING ACCOUNTING CHANGES IN INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This Statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. When a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions, those provisions should be followed. The adoption of these new Statements is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's current financial position, results or operations, or cash flows.

UNDERTAKINGS The undersigned company hereby undertakes: (1) to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of a prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the change in volume and price represents no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement. (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previslu disclodes in the registration statement or any matriel change to such information in the registreation statement. (2) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at the time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) that for the purpose of determining liability of the undersigned small business issuer under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned small business issuer undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned small business issuer will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned small business issuer relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (ss. 230.424 of this chapter); (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned small business issuer or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned small business issuer or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned small business issuer; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned small business issuer to the purchaser. II-5 (5) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, executive officers, and controlling persons of the small business issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the small business issuer has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. (6) In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the small business issuer of expenses incurred or paid by a director, executive officer, or controlling person of the small business issuer in the successful defence of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, executive officer, or controlling person connected with the securities being registered, the small business issuer will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (7) Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.
