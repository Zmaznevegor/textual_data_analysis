SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED APRIL 20, 2010 SQN Alternative Investment Fund III, L.P. Units of Limited Partner Interests at $1,000 per Unit Minimum Offering Proceeds  1,200 Units ($1,200,000) Maximum Offering Proceeds  50,000 Units ($50,000,000) We are SQN Alternative Investment Fund III, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Our General Partner is SQN AIF III GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and our Investment Manager is SQN Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. We are offering a minimum of 1,200 units ($1.2 million) and a maximum of 50,000 units ($50.0 million). We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. Many of our investments will be structured as equipment leases, but we also intend to use other structures, including, but not limited to, participation agreements, residual sharing agreements, project financings and vendor and rental (hire) programs. We expect that approximately 95.0% of the proceeds of this offering will be available for investment and to pay fees, 4.0% of the proceeds of this offering will be used to pay fees and expenses associated with our organization and this offering and 1.0% of the proceeds from this offering will be used to fund a capital reserve. Our principal objectives are to generate non-correlated capital appreciation and make regular cash distributions to you. We anticipate that during our initial years of operation our distributions will be substantially tax-deferred due primarily to depreciation deductions on a portion of our equipment and operating losses. Investing in our units involves a high degree of risk. You should purchase these securities only if you can afford a complete loss of your investment. You should read Risk Factors, beginning on page 16 of this prospectus, for a discussion of factors you should consider before buying our units. Among the most prominent of these risks are the following:  A substantial portion, and possibly all, of the cash distributions you receive from us will be a return of capital and not a return on capital.  This is a blind-pool offering because we have not specifically identified our investments at the time you invest. As a result, you cannot evaluate the risks of, or potential returns from, any of our investments at the time you invest.  Since there is no public market for our units, an investment in our units is considered illiquid. You should be prepared to hold your units for the life of the fund, which is anticipated to be approximately seven years, but may be longer.  You will have very limited voting rights and you must rely on our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates to manage us.  A prolonged economic recession and/or changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment and other portfolio assets, lease rates, and interest rates may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on capital.  Our performance will be subject to the risk of lease and other investment defaults. Uncertainties associated with the equipment leasing and financing industry may have an adverse effect on our business and may adversely affect our ability to provide you any economic return from our units or a complete return of your capital.  Our success will depend in part on our ability to realize residual value from a portion of our assets and equipment once the leases on those assets and equipment terminate.  Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates will receive significant compensation from us, which will reduce distributions to you.  There are potential conflicts of interest between us and our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates.  There are material federal income tax risks associated with this offering.

Our General Partner or its affiliates currently intend to purchase 100 of our units offered hereby at a purchase price of $1,000 per unit. We will not pay any Distribution Expenses in connection with units sold to our General Partner or its affiliates. SQN Securities, LLC, which is an affiliate of our General Partner, will act as the exclusive selling agent for the offering of our units. The units will be offered on a best efforts, minimum-maximum basis. This means the selling agent must sell at least 1,200 units and receive subscription proceeds of at least $1.2 million in order for this offering to close (excluding subscription proceeds from our General Partner or its affiliates and from residents of Pennsylvania), and it must use only its best efforts to sell our remaining units. Our subscription proceeds will be held in an interest bearing escrow account until $1.2 million has been received. This offering will not extend beyond , 2012. If the minimum subscription proceeds are not received by January 1, 2011, then your subscription will be promptly returned to you from the escrow account with interest earned, if any, and without deduction for any fees.

INVESTOR SUITABILITY General Our units are illiquid assets and are not freely transferable. There is no public market in which to sell our units, and we do not expect a public market for the sale of our units to develop. You should purchase our units only if you:  have adequate financial means;  do not need liquidity of your investment; and  are able to withstand the risks inherent in a long-term investment. Our units are not an appropriate investment if you must rely on distributions from us as an important source of income. Thus, you must, at a minimum, meet the requirements described below in order to purchase our units. We, or the selling agent, must have reasonable grounds to believe, on the basis of information obtained from you, (i) that an investment in our units is suitable and appropriate for you in light of your age, investment objectives, investment experience, income, financial situation and needs and other investments; (ii) that your net worth is sufficient to sustain the risks inherent in an investment in our units, including loss of investment and lack of liquidity; and (iii) that you are or will be in a financial position appropriate to enable you to realize to a significant extent the benefits described in this prospectus. We and the selling agent will rely on what you tell us in your subscription agreement, the form of which is attached to this prospectus as Appendix C, about your financial situation and investment objectives, and the selling agent must maintain documents in its files disclosing the basis on which it made the suitability determination of an investment in us by the investors to whom it sold our units. Thus, it is important that you provide complete and accurate information on your subscription agreement. When evaluating your suitability for this investment using the standards listed below, keep in mind that net worth does not include the value of your home furnishings, personal automobiles and the equity in your home. Also, you must value the assets included in your net worth calculation at their fair market value. For fiduciary accounts, such as IRAs, Keogh Plans, and other benefit plans or trusts, these suitability standards must be met by the beneficiary, the IRA, plan or trust or the donor or grantor who directly or indirectly supplies the funds to purchase our units, if that donor or grantor is the fiduciary of the IRA, plan or trust. We will maintain your suitability records for a minimum period of six years. Investment in our units involves substantial risks. You should carefully consider the information in the Risk Factors section and all other information included in this prospectus before investing in our units. General Investor Suitability Requirements You must meet our general suitability requirements in order to purchase our units. In general, you must have either:  a net worth of at least $70,000 plus at least $70,000 of annual gross income; or  a net worth of at least $250,000. iv Table of Contents Additional State Investor Suitability Requirements Residents of certain states are required to meet suitability requirements that differ or are in addition to the general investor suitability requirements stated above. In addition, we are required to make certain disclosures regarding an investment in the units and their transferability. If you are a resident of one of the following states, the differing investor suitability requirements and/or disclosures apply to you. Any additional investor suitability requirements imposed by a state after the date of this prospectus will be disclosed in a supplement to this prospectus. You are urged to review any supplement to this prospectus to determine whether more restrictive standards apply to your investment.  Alabama Investors.

Additional Considerations for IRAs, Qualified Plans and Tax-Exempt Organizations An investment in our units will not, in and of itself, create an IRA or qualified plan. To form an IRA or qualified plan, an investor must comply with all applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). IRAs, qualified plans and tax-exempt organizations should consider the following when deciding whether to invest:  any income or gain realized could be unrelated business taxable income (UBTI), which is subject to the unrelated business income tax;  for qualified plans and IRAs, ownership of our units may cause a pro rata share of our assets to be considered plan assets for the purposes of ERISA and the excise taxes imposed by the Code;  any entity that is exempt from federal income taxation will be unable to take full advantage of any tax benefits generated by us; and  charitable remainder trusts that have any UBTI will be subject to an excise tax equal to 100% of such UBTI. Although our units may represent suitable investments for some IRAs, qualified plans and tax-exempt organizations, our units may not be suitable for your plan or organization due to the particular tax rules that apply to your plan or organization. Furthermore, the investor suitability requirements represent minimum requirements, and the fact that your plan or organization satisfies them does not mean that an investment would be suitable or prudent under your particular facts and circumstances. You should consult your plans tax and financial advisors to determine whether this investment would be advantageous for your particular situation. If you are a fiduciary or investment manager of a qualified plan or IRA, or if you are a fiduciary of another tax-exempt organization, you should consider all risks and investment concerns, including those related to tax considerations, in deciding whether this investment is appropriate and economically advantageous for your plan or organization. See the Risk Factors and Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences sections of this prospectus beginning on page 59. Investor Suitability Requirements in Connection with Transfers of Units Our units are subject to substantial transfer restrictions and may be transferred only under certain circumstances and then subject to certain conditions. One condition is that you may sell or transfer our units only to a recipient who meets all applicable investor suitability requirements. If the transfer is affected through a member firm of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the member firm must be satisfied that a proposed buyer meets investor suitability standards for this investment. FINRA conduct rules also require the member firm to inform the proposed buyer of all pertinent facts relating to the liquidity and marketability of our units. vii Table of Contents Who Should Invest You should purchase our units only if you:  meet the minimum income, net worth standards and other investor suitability requirements specified above;  are prepared to hold your investment in us for our entire term, which we expect will be approximately seven years, but may be longer;  have no need for your investment in us to be liquid; and  are prepared to assume the substantial risks associated with an investment in us. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS OFFERING Q-1. What is SQN Alternative Investment Fund III, L.P. and what does it do? A-1. We are a form of investment opportunity that is commonly referred to as a direct participation program. That means you will beneficially own a pro-rata share of the equipment and other assets in which we invest and that you are eligible to receive the tax benefits inherent in the ownership of certain leased equipment and other assets. We will offer our units and raise funds on a continuous basis until the earlier of (i) two years from the date hereof, or (ii) the date that we have raised $50.0 million. We will hold our initial closing once a minimum of $1.2 million in cash subscriptions has been received (excluding cash subscriptions from our General Partner or its affiliates and from residents of Pennsylvania) on or prior to January 1, 2011. At such time we will pay fees and expenses associated with our organization and this offering and fund a small capital reserve. In addition, we will begin to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. Many of our investments will be structured as equipment leases, but we also intend to use other structures, including, but not limited to, participation agreements, residual sharing agreements, project financings and vendor and rental (hire) programs. For a more detailed discussion of our investment objectives and strategies, please refer to the Investment Objectives and Strategies section of this prospectus beginning on page 45. Q-2. What types of investments will be in our portfolio? A-2. Although the composition of our portfolio cannot be determined at this stage, we expect to invest in equipment and other assets that are considered essential use or core to a business or operation in the agricultural, energy, environmental, medical, manufacturing, technology, and transportation industries. Our Investment Manager also may identify other assets or industries that meet our investment objectives such as modular accommodations. We expect to invest in equipment and other assets located primarily within the United States, Canada and the European Union. Many of our investments will be structured as full payout or operating leases. Full payout leases generally are leases under which the rent over the initial term of the lease will return our invested capital plus an appropriate return without consideration of the residual value, and where the lessee may acquire the equipment or other assets at the end of the lease term. Operating leases generally are leases under which the aggregate noncancellable rental payments during the original term of the lease, on a net present value basis, are not sufficient to recover the purchase price of the equipment or other assets leased under the lease. For a more detailed discussion of our strategies to recover the residual value of equipment it leases to others under operating leases, see the Investment Objectives and Strategies  Leasing and Financing Strategies  Residual realization section of this prospectus beginning on page 52. In addition, we intend to invest by way of participation agreements and residual sharing agreements where we would acquire an interest in a pool of equipment or other assets, or rights to those equipment viii Table of Contents or other assets, at a future date. We also may structure investments as project financings that are secured by, among other things, essential use equipment and/or assets. Finally, we may use other investment structures that our Investment Manager believes will provide us with the appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize our return on investment while protecting against downside risk, such as vendor and rental (hire) programs. In most cases, the structure will include us holding title to or a priority position in the equipment or other asset. For a more detailed discussion of the factors our Investment Manager will consider in selecting our investments please refer to the Investment Objectives and Strategies section of this prospectus beginning on page 45. Q-3. What are the credits and the terms of the investments that will make up the portfolio? A-3. We will invest in a variety of credits ranging from small private businesses, publicly listed entities, international organizations, colleges and universities, hospitals, governments and municipalities. Our Investment Manager is primarily an asset investor and will look at the underlying credit as further investment enhancement. In all cases, the investment committee of our Investment Manager, when contemplating investments, will consider a range of factors including, but not limited to, the following:  the remaining economic useful life of the equipment or other assets;  the anticipated residual value of the equipment or other asset;  whether the equipment or other assets are new or used and their condition;  required registrations;  regulatory considerations;  portfolio diversification;  how essential the equipment or other assets are to the operations of the business; and  the cash flow profile of the equipment or other assets, and the depth of the market and exit mechanisms. Typical investments are expected to have a term of 36 to 60 months with some investments being shorter and others being longer. It is anticipated that our portfolio will be divided between investments that generate regular income on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis and other investments that will not have cash flows until the end of their initial term. The investments that do not generate regular cash flows are intended to be higher yielding while the investments that do generate regular cash flows are intended to provide cash for operations and distributions during the Operating Period (as described below). For a more detailed discussion of the lease types anticipated in us, please refer to the Investment Objectives and Strategies section of this prospectus beginning on page 45. Q-4. What are the investor suitability requirements for this investment? A-4. In general, you must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000, plus at least $70,000 of annual gross income, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Net worth is determined excluding home, home furnishings and automobiles. Some states impose higher suitability requirements. Also, the minimum investment amount for most investors is $25,000 (25 units). Since there is no public market for our units, an investment in our units is considered illiquid. You should invest in us only if you are prepared to hold your units for the life of the Fund which is anticipated to be approximately seven years, but may be longer. For a more detailed discussion of investor suitability requirements in particular states, please refer to the Investor Suitability section of this prospectus beginning on page iv, above. ix Table of Contents Q-5. Who are our General Partner, SQN AIF III GP, LLC, and our Investment Manager, SQN Capital Management, LLC? A-5. Our General Partner, SQN AIF III GP, LLC, was formed in March 2010 as a limited liability company to serve as our general partner. Our General Partner is wholly-owned by our Investment Manager, SQN Capital Management, LLC, which was formed in December 2007 to manage direct participation programs. Our Investment Managers senior management team has substantial experience in the lease investment and finance industries. For the four-year period ended December 31, 2009, our Investment Manager and its affiliates had originated approximately $150.0 million of equipment leasing and finance transactions. The Managing Directors of our Investment Manager have collective experience in managing over $2.0 billion of assets over the past two decades. Our Investment Manager is expected to act as servicer of all of our investments. In addition, our Investment Manager serves as manager of SQN Alternative Investment Fund I, LLC (SQN I) and SQN Alternative Investment Fund II, LLC (SQN II), which are prior equipment leasing and finance programs that were privately offered beginning in February 2008. For a more detailed discussion of our General Partner and our Investment Manager, please refer to the Management section of this prospectus beginning on page 38 and for a more detailed discussion of the operating results of SQN I and SQN II, please refer to the Prior Performance Tables in Appendix B to this prospectus. Q-6. What can you expect happens after you invest in us? A-6. Once our General Partner has accepted your subscription, you will receive a confirmation letter indicating our acceptance of your investment and a copy of your fully executed subscription agreement. We have three phases of different lengths. It is very important to be aware of how we will operate during these three phases so you can evaluate this investment opportunity. We call the period when we are raising money from investors the Offering Period. This period will not exceed two years. We will hold our initial closing once a minimum of $1.2 million in cash subscriptions (excluding cash subscriptions from our General Partner or its affiliates and from residents of Pennsylvania) has been received on or prior to January 1, 2011. We then will begin to make investments in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. Many of our investments will be structured as equipment leases but we also will use other structures, including, but not limited to, participation agreements, residual sharing agreements, project financings and vendor and rental (hire) programs. After we have raised a minimum of $1.2 million, we will continue to hold regular closings to admit new investors until the earlier of (i) two years from the date hereof, or (ii) the date that we have raised $50.0 million. Once we begin investing offering proceeds, the Operating Period will commence. We anticipate that the Operating Period will overlap with the Offering Period and, unless extended by our General Partner, will last for three years from the date it begins. During this period, we will continue to invest and re-invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. During the Operating Period, we plan to make semi-annual distributions of cash to you and our other partners if, in our Investment Managers opinion, such distributions are in our best interests. Therefore, the amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not guaranteed. The targeted distribution rate is 6% annually, paid semi-annually at 3%, of your capital contributions. For a more detailed discussion of our distributions to you, please refer to the Income, Losses and Distributions section of this prospectus beginning on page 57. x Table of Contents Following the Operating Period, the Liquidation Period will begin. Unless extended by our General Partner, the Liquidation Period will last for four years. During the Liquidation Period we will make irregular distributions to you and our other limited partners as the investments in the portfolio mature. We generally will not be reinvesting the proceeds from investments during this period. However, if, in our Investment Managers opinion, it would be in the best interests of our limited partners to reinvest, we may do so. It is our intention to wind down the portfolio and distribute proceeds to you and our other limited partners during the Liquidation Period. For a more detailed discussion of our investment objectives, please refer to the Investment Objectives and Strategies section of this prospectus beginning on page 45. Q-7. What will be the terms of the investments? A-7. We expect our investments to meet economic and legal standards that our Investment Manager has derived from its experience in the equipment lease investment and finance business. In general, we expect that the investment documents will be enforceable contracts that create non-cancelable obligations of the lessee or other counterparty with respect to timely payments, insurance, proper maintenance of the assets or equipment in which we invest, and, if applicable, the return of such assets or equipment in a specified condition. Often such investment documents will create rights for us in the event of a failure of the lessee or other counterparty to perform its payment and other obligations over and above the obligation to cure such a failure. In addition, such investment documents also may include guarantees by parent companies, affiliates, and individual owners of such lessees and other counterparties of such entities obligations to us under the investment documents. For a more detailed discussion of our distributions to you, please refer to the Investment Objectives and Strategies section of this prospectus beginning on page 45. Q-8. Are there tax benefits and consequences of investing in us? A-8. We, as a limited partnership, will not pay income taxes ourselves. Instead, all of our taxable income or losses and other tax items will be passed through to you and our other limited partners. Our General Partner anticipates that during our early years income taxes on distributions to you and to our other limited partners will be substantially tax-deferred by operating losses and depreciation deductions available from the portion of our equipment leased to third-party end users under our operating leases, but not under its full payout leases or other investments. By the time we are in liquidation, the total tax you pay in the aggregate may likely be consistent with the tax you would pay with respect to other taxable investments. The benefit of paying taxes later instead of currently is commonly referred to as tax deferral. We use the term tax deferral to mean that, in the early years of the investment, only a small portion of the cash distributed to you will be considered a return on investment. To the extent in later years the portion considered a return on investment grows, it will be taxable at that time. This is not the same as a tax deferral commonly associated with qualified plans or IRAs where even the portion of your portfolio performance considered a return on investment is not taxable when distributed to the qualified plan or IRA and such earnings remain untaxed until withdrawn. An investment in our units should not be made solely because of the potential for tax deferral. In addition, in some cases other taxes or loss disallowance rules may offset the deferral benefit. Also, the passive activity rules under the Code will apply to natural persons and most other types of investors in us. Thus, you should anticipate that your share of our net income or net loss in each of our taxable years generally will be characterized as passive activity income or loss. Employee benefit plans, such as qualified pension and profit sharing plans, Keogh plans and IRAs, generally are exempt from federal income tax, except that any net UBTI that exceeds a specific deduction of $1,000 in any taxable year is subject to tax. Other charitable and tax exempt organizations are also subject to tax on UBTI. Most of our net income, if any, in a given year may constitute UBTI, because of the nature of equipment leasing. xi Table of Contents For a more detailed discussion, please refer to the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences section of this prospectus beginning on page 59 and the Investment by Qualified Plans and IRAs section of this prospectus beginning on page 79. You are urged to seek advice based on your individual circumstances from an independent tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences to you of an investment in us. Q-9. Will you be able to sell your investment in our units? A-9. Since there is no public market for our units, an investment in our units is considered illiquid. You should only invest money that you can afford to have unavailable for at least seven years, net of distributions that are expected to be made to you during those years. Our units will not be listed on any national securities exchange at any time and we will take steps to ensure that no public trading market develops for our units. Also, in any calendar year, we are limited as to the number of units we may redeem so that we will not be treated as a publicly traded partnership for tax purposes. In addition, the redemption price for your units is unlikely to reflect the fair market value of your units at the time of redemption, particularly during the Liquidation Period. You may realize a greater return by holding on to your units for the duration of our term. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to the Redemption of Units section of this prospectus beginning on page 88. Q-10. Where can I get more information? A-10. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) regarding the units we offer by this prospectus and we will file periodic reports and other information with the SEC. These documents are available at the SECs web site at http:// www.sec.gov . After you are an investor in us, you may contact Investor Relations regarding your account information. The telephone number is (800) 258-6610. You are urged to thoroughly discuss an investment in us with your financial, tax and legal advisors. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to the Where You Can Find More Information section of this prospectus beginning on page 97. xii Table of Contents PROSPECTUS SUMMARY The following summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. It does not contain all of the information that may be important to you in making your investment decision. You should read this entire prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, before deciding to invest in our units. Throughout this prospectus when there is a reference to you it is a reference to you as a potential investor or limited partner in us. SQN Alternative Investment Fund III, L.P. The Partnership We are a Delaware limited partnership formed on March 10, 2010. We will operate a fund in which the capital you invest will be pooled with capital invested by other investors. This pool of capital is then used to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. The pooled capital contributions also will be used to pay fees and expenses associated with our organization and this offering and to fund a capital reserve. Many of our investments will be structured as full payout or operating equipment leases. In addition, we intend to invest by way of participation agreements and residual sharing agreements where we acquire an interest in a pool of equipment or other assets or rights to those equipment or other assets, at a future date. We also may structure investments as project financings that are secured by, among other things, essential use equipment and/or assets. Finally, we may use other investment structures, such as vendor and rental (hire) programs, that our Investment Manager believes will provide us the appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize our return on investment while protecting against downside risk. In most cases, the structure will include us holding title to or a priority position in the equipment or other asset. Although the composition of our portfolio cannot be determined at this stage, we expect to invest in assets and equipment that are considered essential use or core to a business or operation in the agricultural, energy, environmental, medical, manufacturing, technology, and transportation industries. Our Investment Manager also may identify other assets or industries that meet our investment objectives such as modular accommodations. We expect to invest in assets and equipment located primarily within the United States, Canada and the European Union. See Investment Objectives and Strategies section of this prospectus beginning on page 45. We expect that we will conduct our activities for at least seven years and divide the life of the Fund into three periods: Offering Period. We will raise money from investors during this period which we expect will last for up to two years from the date of this prospectus. After we have raised $1.2 million (excluding cash subscriptions from our General Partner or its affiliates and from residents of Pennsylvania), we will begin to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) 1 Table of Contents equipment and Other Physical Assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. Operating Period. After we begin investing the offering proceeds, the Operating Period will begin and, unless extended by our General Partner, will last for three years from the date it begins. We anticipate that the Operating Period will overlap with the Offering Period. During this period, we will continue to invest and re-invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. Liquidation Period. Unless extended by our General Partner, the Liquidation Period will last four years. During the Liquidation Period we will make irregular distributions to you and our other limited partners as the investments in the portfolio mature. We generally will not be reinvesting the proceeds from investments during this period. It is our intention to wind down the portfolio and distribute proceeds to you and the other limited partners during this period. Management Our General Partner, SQN AIF III GP, LLC, and our Investment Manager, SQN Capital Management, LLC, will manage all aspects of our business. Our General Partner will manage all of our day to day activities and operations and our Investment Manager will make all of our investment decisions and manage our investment portfolio. The principal office of our General Partner and Investment Manager is 48 Wall Street, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10005, and their telephone number is (212) 422-2166. Neil A. Roberts is the Chairman and Jeremiah J. Silkowski is the President and CEO of our General Partner and our Investment Manager. Neil A. Roberts, Jeremiah J. Silkowski, Michael Miroshnikov, Hugh Shelmerdine and Timothy R. Spring are the current members of our Investment Managers investment committee. Messrs. Silkowski and Roberts will maintain ultimate investment discretion and will have to be in agreement on the funding of any transactions. They may be contacted at SQN Capital Management, LLC, 48 Wall Street, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10005, telephone (212) 422-2166. See the Management  Investment Committee section of this prospectus beginning on page 40. The management team of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates has substantial experience in the lease investment and finance industries. See the Management section of this prospectus beginning on page 38. Investment Objectives Our investment objectives are to:  preserve, protect and return your invested capital;  generate semi-annual cash distributions to you and our other partners during the Operating Period;  during the period from the date of the initial closing through the end of the Operating Period (i) make investments in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and 2 Table of Contents other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams;  during the Liquidation Period wind down our portfolio and distribute the proceeds therefrom to you and our other limited partners;  generate investment returns that are not correlated to stock, bond, real estate or commodity markets; and  generate a favorable total return on your investment. During the Operating Period, we plan to make semi-annual distributions of cash to you and our other partners, if, in our Investment Managers opinion, such distributions are in our best interests. Therefore, the amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not guaranteed. The targeted distribution rate is 6% annually, paid semi-annually as 3%, of your capital contribution. See the Investment Objectives and Strategies section of this prospectus beginning on page 45 and the Income, Losses and Distributions section of this prospectus beginning on page 57. Most, if not all, of our equipment under our operating leases, but not under our full payout leases or other investments, is expected to be depreciated using accelerated depreciation methods under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences section of this prospectus beginning on page 59. Risk Factors Investing in our units involves a high degree of risk. Accordingly, you should read this entire prospectus, including the section entitled Risk Factors, before making an investment decision.  A substantial portion, and possibly all, of the cash distributions you receive from us will be a return of capital and not a return on capital.  This is a blind-pool offering because we have not specifically identified our investments at the time you invest. As a result, you cannot evaluate the risks of, or potential returns from, any of our investments at the time you invest.  Our units will not be listed on any stock exchange or interdealer quotation system, and there are significant restrictions in our partnership agreement on your ability to transfer your units. We do not intend to assist in the development of any secondary market for, or provide qualified matching services for purchasers and sellers of, our units. Any sale that you may be able to arrange for your units, including the redemption of the units by us, which is at our General Partners sole discretion, is likely to be at a substantial discount to your investment, partnership equity per unit or other measures of value. Therefore, your units will effectively be illiquid. You should be prepared to hold your units for the life of the Fund, which is anticipated to be approximately seven years, but may be longer. 3 Table of Contents  You will have very limited voting rights and you must rely on our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates to manage us.  A prolonged economic recession and/or changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment and other portfolio assets, lease rates, and interest rates may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on capital.  Higher than expected lease and other investment defaults may result in our inability to fully recover our investment or expected income from the affected equipment or physical assets and could reduce our cash distributions to you and our other limited partners. Uncertainties associated with the equipment leasing industry may have an adverse effect on our business and may adversely affect our ability to provide you any economic return from our units or a complete return of your capital.  Our success will depend in part on our ability to realize residual value from a portion of our assets and equipment once the leases on those assets and equipment terminate.  Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates will receive significant compensation from us, which will reduce distributions to you.  There are potential conflicts of interest between us and our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates.  There are material income tax risks associated with this offering. See the Risk Factors section of this prospectus beginning on page 16. Sale of Revenue Streams In connection with transactions that have an associated revenue stream, we may sell such revenue stream on a discounted, non-recourse basis if our Investment Manager believes a sale of such revenue stream would increase our return on the investment while decreasing our exposure to the underlying investment and increase the proceeds available for additional investments. See the Investment Objectives and Strategies  Sale of Revenue Streams section of this prospectus beginning on page 55 of this prospectus. Income, Losses, and Distributions Our income, losses and distributions will be allocated 99% to you and our other limited partners and 1% to our General Partner until you and our other limited partners have received total distributions equal to your and their capital contributions plus an 8% per annum, compounded annually, cumulative return on your and their capital contributions. After such time, all distributed Cash Available for Distribution and distributed Net Disposition Proceeds will be allocated 80% to you and our other limited partners and 20% to our General Partner. Until the end of the Operating Period (and in certain circumstances, during the Liquidation Period), we may invest our Net Disposition Proceeds in additional investments. See 4 Table of Contents the Income, Losses and Distributions section of this prospectus beginning on page 57. Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences This prospectus has a discussion of material U.S. Federal income tax consequences relating to an investment in our units. For a more complete description of the Federal income tax consequences you should read the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences section of this prospectus beginning on page 59. Investors should consult with their tax and financial advisors to determine whether an investment in our units is suitable for their portfolio. Investor Suitability Requirements The units are a long-term investment. Investors must satisfy minimum net worth and income requirements. We have established minimum investor suitability requirements and many state securities commissioners have established investor suitability standards different from these minimum standards which apply to investors in their respective jurisdictions. See the Investor Suitability section of this prospectus beginning on page iv. Glossary In general, defined terms in this prospectus have the meanings assigned to them in the Glossary to this prospectus, or if not defined therein, in our partnership agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to this prospectus. The Offering Securities Offered A minimum of 1,200 units ($1.2 million) and a maximum of 50,000 units ($50.0 million). Our General Partner and Investment Manager have determined that the minimum offering amount represents a level of subscription proceeds which will enable our portfolio to be sufficiently diversified. Our General Partner and Investment Manager limited our maximum offering amount to 50,000 units ($50.0 million) in order to be able to remain selective in choosing our investments. Minimum Investment You must purchase a minimum of 25 units for $25,000. However, the minimum may be waived by our General Partner, at its sole discretion, on a case by case basis. Offering Period The earlier of (i) two years from the date hereof, or (ii) the date that the we have raised $50.0 million. This offering will terminate if we do not receive and accept subscriptions for the minimum offering amount of 1,200 units ($1.2 million), excluding cash subscriptions from our General Partner or its affiliates and from residents of Pennsylvania, by January 1, 2011. Escrow We will deposit your investment in an interest-bearing escrow account until we have received the minimum offering amount or until January 1, 2011, whichever is earlier. If we have not received the minimum offering amount by January 1, 2011, all of your funds will be promptly returned to you with any interest earned, and without deduction for any fees. If we receive the minimum offering amount on or before January 1, 2011, however, then:  you will be admitted as a limited partner, in our General Partners discretion; 5 Table of Contents  your escrowed subscription proceeds will be delivered to us for use as described in this prospectus; and  the interest earned on your escrowed subscription proceeds, if any, net of bank fees, will be paid to you. Estimated Use of Proceeds Assuming that the maximum offering of 50,000 units being offered hereby are sold, we expect that approximately 95.0% of the gross proceeds will be available for investment and to pay fees, 4.0% of the gross proceeds will be used to pay fees and expenses associated with our organization and this offering and 1.0% of the gross proceeds will be used to fund a capital reserve. See the Estimated Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus beginning on page 9. Fees of Our General Partner and its Affiliates Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates, including SQN Securities, LLC in its capacity as the selling agent, will receive fees and compensation from the offering of our units, including the following:  Distribution Expense : We will pay the selling agent Distribution Expenses of 2.0% of the aggregate offering proceeds (excluding proceeds we receive from the sale of our units to our General Partner or its affiliates).  O&O Expense : Our General Partner will receive an organization and offering expense allowance (the O&O Expense Allowance) of 2.0% of our offering proceeds to reimburse it for expenses incurred in preparing us for registration or qualification under federal and state securities laws and subsequently offering and selling our units. The O&O Expense Allowance will not exceed the actual fees and expenses incurred by our General Partner and its affiliates.  Management Fee : Our Investment Manager will receive a management fee in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 1.975% per annum of the aggregate offering proceeds, or (ii) $60,000, payable monthly. Our General Partners and Investment Managers Relationship with Us May be Conflicted Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest because of their relationship to us. These potential conflicts include:  our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates may compete with us;  no independent underwriter conducted due diligence with respect to this offering;  we and our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates are not represented by separate counsel;  the receipt of fees and other compensation by our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates;  we will rely on employees of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates; 6 Table of Contents  the resolution of conflicts will be undertaken by the investment committee of our Investment Manager; and  our General Partner will act as our tax matters partner. See the Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary Responsibilities section of this prospectus beginning on page 30. Partnership Agreement You and the other purchasers of our units will be our limited partners. Our partnership agreement will govern the following:  our activities;  the relationships among you and our other limited partners; and  the relationship between our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates, on the one hand, and you and our other limited partners, on the other hand. The following is a brief summary of some of the principal provisions of our partnership agreement, apart from the income, loss and distribution allocation provisions and the fees of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates described previously in this summary. See the Summary of Our Partnership Agreement section of this prospectus beginning on page 82. In addition, you should read the form of our partnership agreement, which is included as Appendix A to this prospectus.  Voting rights : You will have one vote for each unit you purchase. You and our other limited partners are entitled to vote on specified fundamental matters, such as:  amendments to our partnership agreement;  removal of our General Partner and election of a substitute general partner;  our merger with another entity;  the sale of all, or substantially all, of our assets (except during the Liquidation Period); or  our dissolution. Otherwise, you and our other limited partners have no participation in determining our operations or policies.  Meetings: Our General Partner, or our limited partners holding 10% or more of our outstanding units, may call a meeting of the limited partners on matters on which they are entitled to vote.  Limited liability: So long as you do not participate in the control of our business and otherwise act in conformity with our partnership agreement, your liability as a limited partner will be limited to the amount of your invested capital, plus your share of any of our undistributed profits and assets.  Transferability of units : Our partnership agreement restricts the transfer of units so that we will not be treated as a publicly traded partnership for federal income tax purposes and will not be taxed as a corporation. As a result of these restrictions, you 7 Table of Contents probably will not be able to transfer your units if, or when, you want to.  Removal of general partner: Our General Partner may be removed only on a vote of limited partners holding a majority of our outstanding units. Neither our General Partner nor any of its affiliates may participate in any vote by you and our other limited partners to remove our General Partner as general partner.  Amendment of partnership agreement: Our partnership agreement generally may be amended by the vote of limited partners holding a majority of our outstanding units. However, no amendment may be made that would change any partners interest in distributions without the consent of all affected partners.  Term : Our term will end at midnight on December 31, 2034, unless sooner dissolved or terminated by our General Partner. Subscription Procedure You must fill out and sign a subscription agreement, the form of which is attached to this prospectus as Appendix C, in order to purchase our units. You should send your subscription agreement and a check for the purchase price of your units as instructed in the subscription agreement. Wire transfer instructions are available on request. Closings We will hold the initial closing of this offering when we receive subscription proceeds of at least $1.2 million, excluding subscription proceeds from Pennsylvania residents and from our General Partner and its affiliates. At that time, we will admit investors as limited partners and receive the escrowed subscription proceeds from the escrow agent. After the initial closing, we will hold regular closings until we have sold all of the units or this offering closes, whichever comes first. 8 Table of Contents ESTIMATED USE OF PROCEEDS The table below sets forth information about our expected use of proceeds from this offering, assuming we pay the maximum compensation and expense reimbursements under our partnership agreement. Many of the amounts set forth below, such as the amount of offering and organization expenses, distribution expenses and capital reserves, are only estimates and not statements of expenditures already incurred. The actual amounts will depend on the course of the offering of our units and our operations. We expect to commit approximately 95.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering to the cash portion of the purchase price of our portfolio.

Our General Partner and its affiliates who participate in the offering will pay $1,000 per unit and we will not pay any Distribution Expenses in connection with the sale of such units. (4) We will initially establish capital reserves in an amount equal to 1.0% of offering proceeds for general working capital purposes. This amount may fluctuate from time to time as our General Partner determines the level of reserves necessary for our proper operation in the exercise of its business judgment. Any net offering proceeds not used to acquire portfolio investments or needed as capital reserves will be returned to our limited partners as described under Investment Objectives and Strategies beginning on page 45 of this prospectus. (5) The amount available to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of equipment or other assets plus related acquisition expenses, which are treated for tax and accounting purposes as capitalized costs added to the basis of the items of equipment or other assets to which they relate and management fees. 9 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION Summary Table The following table includes estimates of the maximum amounts of all compensation and other payments that our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates will receive, directly or indirectly, in connection with our operations. The terms of the compensation of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates were not determined by arms-length negotiation, but are consistent with the guidelines set forth by the North American Securities Administrators Administration. Our partnership agreement does not permit our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates to receive more than the maximum fees or expenses stated for each type of compensation by reclassifying such items under a different category. Estimated Amount Assuming Entity Receiving Compensation Type of Compensation Maximum Units Sold ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING STAGE Selling Agent Distribution Expenses. 2.0% of the aggregate offering proceeds (excluding proceeds we receive from the sale of our units to our General Partner or its affiliates). The total amount of Distribution Expenses cannot be determined because it is based on the number of units sold. If the minimum amount of $1.2 million is raised, the total amount of Distribution Expenses will be $24,000. If the maximum amount of $50.0 million is raised, inclusive of the $100,000 that will be purchased by our General Partner or its affiliates, the total amount of Distribution Expenses will be $998,000. General Partner and affiliates Organizational and Offering Expense Allowance (O&O Expense Allowance). We will pay our General Partner an allowance for the O&O Expense. The amount of the O&O Expense Allowance is based upon the number of units that are sold, including units sold to our General Partner or its affiliates. Total O&O Expense Allowance payable or reimbursable by us may not exceed 2.0% of all offering proceeds. The O&O Expense Allowance will not exceed the actual fees and expenses incurred by our General Partner or its affiliates in connection with our organization and this offering. The total amount of O&O Expense Allowance cannot be determined because it is based on the number of units sold. If the minimum amount of $1.2 million is raised, the total amount of O&O Expense Allowance will be $24,000. If the maximum amount of $50.0 million is raised, the total amount of O&O Expense Allowance will be $1.0 million. Collectively, the O&O Expense Allowance and the Distribution Expenses will not exceed 4.0% of the aggregate offering proceeds. 10 Table of Contents Estimated Amount Assuming Entity Receiving Compensation Type of Compensation Maximum Units Sold OPERATIONAL STAGE Investment Manager Management Fee . We will pay our Investment Manager a Management Fee in an amount equal to the greater of 1.975% per annum of the aggregate offering proceeds, or $60,000, paid monthly. The total amount of Management Fee to be paid each month cannot be determined because it is based on the aggregate offering proceeds. If the minimum amount of $1.2 million is raised, the monthly Management Fee will be $60,000. If the maximum amount of $50.0 million is raised, the monthly Management Fee will be $82,292. The amount of the Management Fee and/or the Promotional Interest, as described below, payable in any year will be reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Sponsor Fee Limit, as described below. The Management Fee will be paid for services rendered by our Investment Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio. Our Investment Manager will supervise performance of all management activities, including, among other activities:  the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio;  the collection of lease and other revenues;  monitoring compliance by lessees and other counterparties with their contract terms;  assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements;  paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so;  monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance;  originating and servicing our investment portfolio; and  preparation of operating financial data (excluding financial statements and tax matters). 11 Table of Contents Estimated Amount Assuming Entity Receiving Compensation Type of Compensation Maximum Units Sold General Partner and affiliates Reimbursement of Operating and Acquisition Expenses . We may reimburse our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates for expenses they pay on our behalf. These reimbursements will include: The total amount of Operating and Acquisition Expenses cannot be determined at this time.  the actual cost to our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates of services, goods and materials used for and by us and obtained from unaffiliated parties; and  the cost of administrative services provided by our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates and necessary or prudent for our operation, provided that reimbursement for administrative services will be at the lower of (i) the actual cost of such services, or (ii) the amount that we would be required to pay to independent parties for comparable services . General Partner and affiliates Distributions and Promotional Interest . Our General Partner will initially receive 1.0% of all distributed Cash Available for Distribution and distributed Net Disposition Proceeds. Our General Partner will have a Promotional Interest in us equal to 20.0% of all distributed Cash Available for Distribution and distributed Net Disposition Proceeds after we have provided a return to our limited partners of their respective capital contributions plus an 8.0% per annum, cumulative return, compounded annually on their capital contributions. Our General Partner will not contribute any cash to us in return for the Promotional Interest. The total amount of Promotional Interest cannot be determined because it will depend upon the amount by which our income from operations and from the disposition of investments exceeds our expenses as well as whether the required investor return has been achieved. The amount of the Management Fee and/or the Promotional Interest payable in any year will be reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Sponsor Fee Limit, as described below. 12 Table of Contents We estimate that the total amount of expenses we will reimburse to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates for their administrative services on our behalf during our first full year of operations, assuming we sell the maximum number of units, will be approximately $0. Limitations on Fees We have adopted a single Management Fee plus the Promotional Interest as a means of compensating our General Partner and the Investment Manager for sponsoring us and managing our operations, respectively. While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investors understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states merit review guidelines. The total of all Front-End Fees, the Promotional Interest and the Management Fee will be subject to the Sponsor Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that we will not bear greater fees than permitted under the states merit review guidelines. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) is an organization of state securities administrators and those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states. NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines). Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment to program sponsors of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services, and sets the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as us. The Sponsor Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of our prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation). Under the Sponsor Fee Limit, we will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Management Fee we will pay the Investment Manager and its affiliates, when added to our General Partners Promotional Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation. Sponsor Fee Limit. The Sponsor Fee Limit will be calculated each year during our term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates, if our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation through the end of such year, including our General Partners Promotional Interest. To the extent that the amount paid as Front-End Fees, the Management Fee, and the Promotional Interest for any year would, when added to amounts paid in all prior years, cause the total fees through the end of such year to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the same period, the Management Fee and/or Promotional Interest for that year will be reduced so that the total of all such compensation paid through the end of the period will not exceed the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation. To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to our Investment Manager or our General Partner, as the case may be, in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Sponsor Fee Limit as calculated through that later period. Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by our General Partner or Investment Manager, as the case may be, at liquidation. Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, we are required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Offering Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Offering Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering our equipment; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Offering Proceeds. We intend to incur total indebtedness equal to 0% of the aggregate cost of its equipment. Our partnership agreement requires us to commit at least 95.0% of the Gross Offering Proceeds to Investment in Equipment and to pay fees. Based on the formula in the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, our minimum Investment in Equipment would equal 80.00% of gross proceeds (80%−0% ×.0625% = 80.00%), 13 Table of Contents and our minimum Investment in Equipment therefore would exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 15.0%. The amount of the Promotional Interest our General Partner is permitted under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Offering Proceeds we ultimately commit to Investment in Equipment exceeds the minimum Investment in Equipment under the NASAA Fee Limitation. The NASAA Fee Limitation permits our General Partner and its affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1% for the first 2.5% of excess Investment in Equipment over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1% for the next 2% of such excess, and 1% for each additional 1% of excess Investment in Equipment. With a minimum Investment in Equipment of 95.0%, our General Partner and its affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 12.5% of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5% + 2% + 10.5% = 15%; 1% + 1% + 10.5% = 12.5%). At the lowest permitted level of Investment in Equipment, the NASAA Guidelines would permit our General Partner and its affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until limited partners have received total Distributions equal to their capital contributions plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their adjusted invested capital, as calculated under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15% of all Distributions. With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 17.5% of Distributions of Cash from Operations (12.5% + 5% = 17.5%), and 13.5% of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (12.5% + 1% = 13.5%), before the subordination level was reached, and 27.5% of all Distributions thereafter. The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the our partnership agreement are subject to the application of the Sponsor Fee Limit provided in Section 9.4(e) of our partnership agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates as the Front-End Fees, Management Fee and the Promotional Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation. Upon completion of the offering of our units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and other assets and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, if any, our General Partner will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to our General Partner and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Front-End Fees, Management Fee and Promotional Interest. If and to the extent that the Front-End Fees, Management Fee and Promotional Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation. The adjusted Sponsor Fee Limit will then be applied to the Management Fee and/or Promotional Interest as described above. A comparison of the Front-End Fees actually paid by us and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter. Defined Terms Used in the Management Compensation Section Definitions of certain capitalized terms used in the foregoing Management Compensation section are as follows: Cash Available for Distribution means our cash funds provided from operations, without deduction for depreciation, but after deducting cash funds used to pay all other expenses plus cash available for distribution from our reserves less amounts set aside for restoration or creation of reserves. Distributions means any cash distributed to holders and our General Partner arising from their respective interests in us. 14 Table of Contents Front-End Fees means fees and expenses paid by any party for any services rendered during our organization and acquisition phase including organization and offering expenses, leasing fees, acquisition fees, acquisition expenses, and any other similar fees, however designated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Front-End Fees shall not include any acquisition fees or acquisition expenses paid by a manufacturer of equipment to any of its employees unless such persons are affiliates of our General Partner. Investment in Equipment means the amount of capital contributions actually paid or allocated to purchase, manufacture, or renovate equipment and other portfolio assets (such as physical assets or leases) acquired by us, including the purchase of equipment, working capital reserves allocable thereto (except that working capital reserves shall not be included), and other cash payments such as interest and taxes but excluding Front-End Fees. Net Disposition Proceeds means the proceeds we realized from the sale, refinancing or other disposition of our investments (including insurance proceeds or lessee or borrower indemnity payments arising from the loss or destruction of an asset) less all our liabilities. Net Income or Net Loss means our taxable income or taxable loss as determined for federal income tax purposes, computed by taking into account each item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit not already included in the computation of taxable income and taxable loss, but does not mean Distributions. Promotional Interest means the allocable share of all distributed Cash Available for Distribution and distributed Net Disposition Proceeds (after a return to our limited partners of their respective capital contributions plus an 8% per annum cumulative return on their capital contributions) payable to our General Partner pursuant to Sections 9.4 of our partnership agreement. Sponsor Fee Limit means the total fees payable calculated pursuant to the NASAA Fee Limitation determined in the manner described therein. 15 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS This investment involves a high degree of risk. You should consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this prospectus in evaluating the purchase of our units. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, you may lose some or all of your investment. Risks Associated with this Offering We may not return all of your investment or any rate of return on your investment. A substantial portion, and possibly all, of the cash distributions you receive from us will be a return of capital. The portion of your total distributions that is a return of capital and the portion that is investment income will depend on a number of factors and cannot be determined until all of our investments have been sold or matured. At that time, you will be able to compare the total amount of all cash distributions received by you to your total capital invested in us, and determine your investment income. We cannot predict the amount of cash we will generate. Therefore, we cannot predict the amount of cash distributions we will make to you and our other partners. We cannot predict the amount of cash we will generate and, as a result, the amount of distributions we may pay you and our other partners, if any. The actual amounts of cash we generate will depend on numerous factors which may be beyond our control and may reduce or delay our cash distributions to you and our other partners, including:  the demand for the leases we provide;  our ability to obtain financings or leverage on acceptable terms to build our portfolio;  profitability of our operations;  lease and other investment defaults;  prevailing economic conditions; and  government regulations. The amount and timing of distributions may vary over time and cash distributions may not be made on schedule. From time to time, our General Partner may vary the amount of, or completely suspend, cash distributions to you and our other partners if it believes it to be in our best interests to do so. Losses from our investments or unavailability of liquid assets also may result in suspensions of distributions. Furthermore:  during the Liquidation Period, cash distributions will be irregular while our investments are being disposed of; and  large returns of capital during our term will reduce the cash available for future distributions. During the Operating Period, we plan to pay you and our other partners semi-annual distributions in an aggregate amount equal to 3.0% on your and their respective capital contributions. However, you should not assume that we will generate cash sufficient to pay you and our other partners all or any part of the 3.0% semi-annual distribution. You should not rely on the cash distributions from your units as a regular source of cash. Because we do not know what the composition of our investment portfolio will be, you cannot evaluate our portfolio at the time you invest. We are what is typically referred to as a blind pool offering because we have not specifically identified any of our investments. We will begin to develop our portfolio after we receive the minimum offering 16 Table of Contents proceeds and are ready to invest our funds. Therefore, you will not be able to assess all of the potential risks associated with the investment in our units as you do not have information about the transactions we will enter into, including:  the types, ages, manufacturers, model or condition of the equipment and other assets in our portfolio;  the identity, financial condition and creditworthiness of the end-users;  the terms and conditions of the transactions;  the type of collateral securing the investment;  the purchase price that will be paid for our investments; or  the expected residual value of the investments. You must rely upon our Investment Managers judgment and ability to select our investments, evaluate the assets condition, evaluate the ability of end-users to perform their obligations to us and negotiate transaction documents. We cannot assure you that our Investment Manager will be able to perform such functions in a manner that will achieve our investment objectives. Our and our General Partners and our Investment Managers lack of operating history decreases your ability to evaluate your investment. We and our General Partner were formed in March 2010 and have no performance history upon which to evaluate your investment. Also, we cannot predict whether our intended operations will meet our stated investment objectives. SQN I and SQN II, which are prior private equipment leasing and finance funds sponsored by our Investment Manager are still in their operating stages and have only a limited performance history. Thus, our Investment Manager has only a limited history in managing funds similar to us for you to evaluate. See Appendix B  Prior Performance Tables, to this prospectus. Since there is no public market for our units, an investment in our units is considered illiquid. You should be prepared to hold your units for the duration of the Fund, which is anticipated to be approximately seven years, but may be longer. Our units will not be listed on any national securities exchange at any time and we will take steps to ensure that no public trading market develops for our units. Your ability to sell or transfer your units will be very limited. You should be prepared to hold your units for the life of the Fund, which is anticipated to be approximately seven years, but may be longer. We have established these restrictions to comply with federal and state securities laws and so that we will not be considered to be a publicly traded partnership that is taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Thus, you probably will not be able to sell or otherwise liquidate your units in the event of an emergency and if you were able to arrange a sale, the price you would receive for your units would likely be at a substantial discount to the price you paid for your units. You should invest in us only if you are prepared to hold your units for at least seven years, which is the period consisting of:  an Offering Period of up to two years;  an Operating Period of three years which we expect will overlap with the Offering Period; and  a subsequent Liquidation Period of approximately four years, during which our investments will either mature or be sold. 17 Table of Contents Our General Partner, our Investor Manager and their affiliates will manage our operations and may make decisions with which you do not agree or which do not achieve our business objectives. Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates will have all management control over our operations and you are not permitted to take part in managing, establishing or changing our investment objectives or policies. Our success will significantly depend upon:  the ability of our Investment Manager to source appropriate transactions for us in a timely manner;  the quality of the investment decisions our Investment Manager makes, especially relating to the types of investments into which we invest, the timing and management of those investments, assessments of potential end-users and the residual value of our investments; and  our Investment Managers ability to extract maximum value from assets and equipment once they reach the end of the lease term. Unlike a holder of common stock in a corporation, as a limited partner you will have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. For example, an affirmative vote of partners owning not less than a majority of our units is required to remove our General Partner or anyone else as general partner. You should not purchase our units unless you are willing to entrust all aspects of our management to our General Partner and our Investment Manager. If you request that we redeem your units you may receive much less than if you kept your units for the duration of our term. At any time after you have been admitted as one of our limited partners, you may request us to redeem some or all of your units. However, the redemption of your units is subject to the following:  we have no obligation to redeem any of your units;  we will not maintain a cash reserve for this purpose; and  in any given year our total unit transfers, including redemptions of our units, may not exceed 2% of our total capital or profits interests. If we do agree to redeem your units, the redemption price may provide you a much lower value than the value you would realize if you kept your units for the duration of our term. Depending on when you request redemption, the redemption price may be less than the unreturned amount of your investment. Spreading the risks of leasing by diversifying our investments will be reduced if we raise only the minimum offering proceeds. We may begin operations with a minimum capitalization of $1.2 million (excluding cash subscriptions from our General Partner or its affiliates and from residents of Pennsylvania). Should we raise less than our maximum offering amount of $50.0 million, our portfolio may be less diversified than would otherwise be the case. As we will be limited in the types and number of transactions we may enter into, a single transaction may have a greater impact on the overall performance of our portfolio. If we only raise the minimum offering, or have a low level of capitalization, a loss on any single transaction may have a greater negative impact on our financial performance. If we do not raise our minimum offering amount we will not commence operations. We require a minimum capitalization of $1.2 million to commence operations. If the amount of proceeds raised as of January 1, 2011 are insufficient to constitute the minimum offering, all subscription proceeds deposited by you into our escrow account will be returned to you, together with any interest earned and without deduction for fees, commissions or expenses. In such a case we will not begin any business operations, we will not make any investments and we will not make any distributions. 18 Table of Contents Any delays in the investment of the offering proceeds may diminish the returns on our investments. We will receive only minimal, if any, returns on the offering proceeds until the time the offering proceeds are invested in equipment, other assets or other investments. If we do not invest the offering proceeds promptly, the delay may diminish the returns that the investment would have otherwise realized had a given investment been made earlier. The price of the units offered by this prospectus has been arbitrarily determined. You should not rely on this price as an indication of the value of the units. The offering price per unit has been determined arbitrarily and is not based upon our actual or potential earnings or any other criteria for determining value. No representation is made hereby that a unit has a market value equal to the purchase price or could be sold at the purchase price or at any other price. Lack of independent counsel or an independent underwriter may reduce the due diligence review of us and our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates. The legal counsel that represents our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates, including our selling agent, also represents us. You and our other limited partners, as a group, have not been represented by separate legal counsel, and the selling agents due diligence examination of us and this offering cannot be considered to be independent. See the Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary Responsibilities  Lack of Independent Underwriter and Due Diligence Investigation in This Offering section of this prospectus. You could be liable for our obligations if you participate in the control of our business, and you may be required to return improperly received distributions. In general, limited partners are not liable for the obligations of a limited partnership unless they participate in the control of the limited partnerships business. If it were determined that any of the following rights, or the exercise of those rights by the limited partners as a group, constituted participation in the control of our business, then you could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner:  the right to remove our General Partner and elect a substitute general partner;  the right to approve certain amendments to our partnership agreement; or  the right to take other specified actions under our partnership agreement. This means that if you were deemed to be a general partner, you could be held personally liable for our obligations and losses beyond the amount you paid for your units. In addition, under the laws of the State of Delaware you may be required to return to us any distribution you received from us if you knew at the time the distribution was made that it was improper because it rendered us insolvent. For a further discussion of your liabilities as a limited partner, you should read the Summary of Our Partnership Agreement  Limited Liability of Limited Partners section of this prospectus. Your ability to begin an action against our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates is limited by our partnership agreement. Our partnership agreement provides that none of our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates will have any liability to us for any loss we suffer arising out of any action or inaction of our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates, if our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates, as the case may be, determined, in good faith, that the course of conduct was in our best interests and did not constitute negligence or misconduct. As a result of these provisions in our partnership agreement, your right to begin an action against our General Partner may be more limited than it would be without these provisions. For a discussion of these provisions of our partnership agreement, you should read the Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary Responsibilities  Fiduciary Duty of Our General Partner section of this prospectus. 19 Table of Contents Risks Associated with our Business Poor economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to build our portfolio. A prolonged economic slowdown in the United States, European Union, and/or Canada could adversely affect our ability to invest the proceeds of this offering as quickly as we would like to if businesses aggressively seek to reduce their costs. If this happens, our distributions to you and our other partners during the initial period of our operations may be less than if our offering proceeds were fully invested in accordance with our timetable. It also could result in reduced interest rates, which could reduce the returns we can obtain on our investments and, as a consequence, the distributions we can make to you and our other partners. Depending primarily on the severity and duration of a general economic slowdown, the creditworthiness of our end-users could be adversely affected if they have difficulty obtaining financing for their business operations, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and cause us to incur a loss. Our success will be subject to risks inherent in the equipment leasing and finance business, any of which may affect our ability to operate profitably. A number of factors may affect our ability to operate profitably including, the following:  changes in economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment and other assets, interest rates and inflation rates;  the quality of the equipment or other assets we acquire and lease or finance;  the continuing strength of equipment manufacturers;  the timing of our investments and our ability to forecast technological advances;  technological and economic obsolescence of the equipment and other assets we acquire;  our ability to obtain financings or leverage on acceptable terms to build our portfolio;  defaults by our lessees or other counterparties; and  increases in our expenses, including labor, tax and insurance expenses. Fluctuations in demand for equipment may affect the ability of a leasing and finance program to invest its capital in a timely manner. Equipment lessors have experienced a more difficult market in which to make suitable investments during historical periods of reduced growth and recession in the U.S. economy as a result of the softening demand for capital equipment during these periods. Economic recession resulting in lower levels of capital expenditure by businesses may result in more used equipment becoming available on the market and downward pressure on prices and lease rates due to excess inventory. Periods of low interest rates exert downward pressure on lease rates and may result in less demand for lease financing. There can be no assurance as to what future developments may occur in the economy in general or in the demand for equipment and lease financing in particular. Higher than expected equipment lease or other investment defaults may result in losses. Higher than expected equipment lease or other investment defaults may result in a loss of anticipated revenues. These losses may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to you and our other partners and, if the level of defaults is sufficiently large, may result in our inability to fully recover our investment. While we will seek to repossess and re-lease or sell any equipment or other asset that is subject to a defaulted lease, we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In some cases, the cost of repossessing the equipment or other asset subject to a defaulted lease or other investment may make trying to recover the equipment or other asset impractical. Also, if a lessee or borrower under a defaulted lease or other investment files for protection under the bankruptcy laws, then:  we may experience difficulties and delays in recovering the equipment or other asset from the defaulting party; and 20 Table of Contents  we may be unable to enforce important contract provisions against the insolvent party, including the contract provisions that require the equipment or other asset to be returned to us in good condition. In addition, we may suffer a loss, or our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected, by the high costs of:  enforcing a lessees or borrowers contract obligations;  recovering equipment or other asset from the defaulting party;  transporting, storing, and repairing the equipment or other asset; and  finding a new lessee or purchaser for the equipment or other asset. The equipment leasing industry is highly competitive, which may hinder our ability to source appropriate or attractive investments. The equipment leasing industry both in the U.S. and abroad, and across different equipment classes, is highly competitive. In particular:  it is often relatively easy for new entrants to enter the equipment leasing industry as lessors;  leasing companies often act irrationally or unprofitably to gain market share, reducing the availability of attractive lease transactions to other lessors in the market; and  lease transactions are not always written in a manner which provide the lessor with an appropriate rate of return for the risk being assumed. The equipment leasing and finance business is highly fragmented. We will compete with:  a large number of national, regional and local banks, savings banks, leasing companies and other financial institutions;  captive finance and leasing companies affiliated with major equipment manufacturers; and  other sources of equipment lease financing, including other publicly-offered partnerships. Some of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than either we or our General Partner and its affiliates will have, even if we sell the maximum number of units in this offering. If we are unable to realize the residual value of our equipment or other assets under our operating leases, we may incur losses. We expect that some of our leases will be operating leases, under which the net present value of aggregate rental payments during the initial lease term is structured to result in our recovery of an amount less than or equal to 90% of the purchase price of the equipment or other asset. Thus, our ability to recover the full purchase price of the equipment or other asset and our expected return in connection with an operating lease depends on the potential value of the equipment or other asset once the primary lease term expires. We call this the residual value. The residual value will depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including:  whether the original lessee wants to keep the equipment or other asset;  the cost of comparable new equipment or other asset;  whether the leased equipment or other asset is obsolete or in poor condition; and  whether there is a secondary market for the type of used equipment or other asset. We cannot assure you that our value assumptions will be accurate or that the equipment or other assets will not lose value more rapidly than we anticipated. 21 Table of Contents The market value of our equipment or any asset may be lower than anticipated, resulting in a loss on our investment. When we enter into a lease, we will not know what the remarketing price of the equipment or other asset leased will be when the lease ends and the equipment or other asset is returned to us. If the remarketing price is lower than anticipated, we will either lose money or receive lower returns than anticipated. There are numerous factors beyond our control which can materially adversely affect the remarketing price we can achieve for equipment or other asset, including:  the general market value for the equipment or other asset at the time we are attempting to remarket that equipment or other asset;  the cost of new equipment or other asset at the time we are remarketing the used equipment or other asset;  technological and regulatory developments since our initial purchase of the equipment or other asset which could reduce the market value of the equipment or other asset;  general economic conditions and the conditions in industry-specific market sectors; and  the condition of the equipment or other asset returned to or repossessed by us. Additionally, there is a risk that the best remarketing price available is only obtainable in a market where we do not have appropriate or adequate remarketing resources. We cannot assure you that our assumptions with respect to value will be accurate or that the equipment or other asset will not lose value more rapidly than we anticipate. Our inability to obtain insurance for certain types of losses means we must bear the cost of any losses from the non-insurable risks. While our leases will generally require lessees to have comprehensive insurance on the equipment or other assets under lease and to assume the risk of loss, some losses may be either uninsurable or not economically feasible to insure, such as losses from war, earthquakes or terrorist acts. Furthermore, we can neither anticipate nor obtain insurance against all possible contingencies that may affect the equipment or other asset. If an event occurs for which we have no insurance, we could lose some or all of our investment in the affected equipment or other asset. Furthermore, lessees who are obliged to insure equipment or any asset may nevertheless fail to do so in breach of their lease contract. In leasing some types of equipment and other assets we may be exposed to environmental tort liability. In leasing some types of equipment and other assets, such as transportation assets designed to carry hazardous materials, we may be exposed to environmental tort liability. Although we will use reasonable efforts to minimize the possibility of and exposure to environmental tort liability, including by means of attempting to obtain insurance, we cannot assure you that our equipment and other assets will be protected against those claims. Failure to maintain equipment registrations and unexpected regulatory compliance costs may result in losses. Certain types of transportation equipment are subject to registration requirements by governmental agencies in the United States and abroad. Should we fail to properly maintain registration of that equipment, we may lose the ability to own or operate that equipment. In addition to impairing our ability to earn rentals from that equipment, penalties may be imposed upon us and we may be forced into a sale of that equipment on unfavorable terms. Furthermore, governmental agencies may require changes or improvements to equipment resulting in increased costs and loss of rental revenue while the changes are made. This would adversely affect our anticipated returns from that investment. 22 Table of Contents If we are, or become, subject to usury laws, it could result in reduced revenues or, possibly, loss on our investment. Leases of equipment and other assets have sometimes been deemed to be loan transactions subject to state usury laws. These laws impose maximum interest rates that may be charged on loans as well as penalties for violation, including restitution of any excess interest received and declaring the debt to be unenforceable. We will seek to structure our leases of equipment and other assets so that they will not be deemed to be loans and violate state usury laws. However, uncertainties in the application of some laws may result in inadvertent violations which could result in reduced investment returns or, possibly, loss on our investment in the affected equipment and other assets. Interest rate changes may reduce the value of our portfolio and our returns. Changes in interest rates will affect the market value of our portfolio. In general, the market value of an equipment lease will change in inverse relation to an interest rate change when the lease has a fixed rate of return. Thus, in a period of rising interest rates, the market value of our equipment leases will decrease. A decrease in the market value of our portfolio will adversely affect our ability to liquidate it. Participation with affiliated programs or third-parties in joint ventures may require us to pay additional costs or incur losses because of actions taken by the third-parties. Our partnership agreement permits us to invest in equipment or other assets through joint venture arrangements with our General Partners affiliated investment programs or independent third-parties. Investing in joint ventures involves risks not present when we invest by ourself. These risks include:  our co-venturer may have business or economic objectives or interests that are inconsistent with ours and it may want to manage the joint venture in ways that do not maximize our return;  actions by a co-venturer might subject equipment or other asset leases owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those we contemplate; and  when more than one person owns property, there may be a stalemate on decisions, including decisions regarding a proposed sale or other transfer of the equipment or other assets. Although our partnership agreement requires that any joint venture arrangement in which we participate must permit us to buy equipment or other assets from the other co-venturer in the case of a proposed sale of the equipment or other assets, we may not have the resources to do so. See the Conflicts of Interest And Fiduciary Responsibilities  We May Enter Into Joint Ventures With Affiliated Programs section of this prospectus. We may suffer losses as a result of transacting business in foreign countries, dealing with foreign clients or having our equipment or other assets located in a foreign jurisdiction. It is likely that we will enter into transactions:  with foreign clients;  where the equipment or other asset is permanently or temporarily located outside the U.S.; or  where the contracts are governed by foreign laws. These transactions involve a number of risks, including the following:  we may have difficulty enforcing our rights under foreign contracts;  we may have difficulty repossessing our equipment or other asset outside the U.S.;  legal costs may be more expensive outside the U.S.; 23 Table of Contents  foreign governments may confiscate equipment or other assets, nationalize equipment, retrospectively change laws, impose new or changed fees, duties or taxes or impose foreign exchange restrictions which hamper our ability to receive payment in the U.S.;  foreign courts may not recognize judgments obtained in U.S. courts;  we may have documentary risks where contracts are written in a language other than English;  complications may arise from interpretations of tax or legal codes and any regulatory registration requirements;  changes in, or interpretations of, foreign laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to enter into leases, sell equipment or other assets or repatriate profits to the U.S.;  the income earned in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to withholding and/or income taxes, and depending on the foreign country, the U.S. may not have a tax treaty in place to reduce or eliminate the tax; and  the U.S. tax code imposes restrictions on the use of foreign tax credits, which may prevent you from claiming full credit for your share of foreign taxes. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences section of this prospectus. Movements in foreign currency rates may result in losses. We will enter into purchase, sale and lease contracts for equipment and other assets where the payments to be made or received are not in U.S. dollars. We do not anticipate that we will hedge our portfolio against foreign currency fluctuation risk. If we are due to receive payments from a client or purchaser in a currency other than U.S. dollars, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against that currency will mean we are receiving less, as expressed in U.S. dollars, than initially anticipated, which would have a negative impact on our returns. Risks Associated with our Organization and Structure Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates may be subject to various conflicts of interest arising out of their relationship to us. The decisions of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates will be subject to various conflicts of interest arising out of their relationship to us and their affiliates. Conflicts of interest that may affect us and our limited partners include:  our partnership agreement does not prohibit our General Partner, our Investment Manager or any of their affiliates from competing with us for investments and engaging in other types of business;  the selling agent, which is an affiliate of our General Partner and our Investment Manager and not an independent securities firm, will review and perform due diligence on us and the information in this prospectus and thus its review cannot be considered an independent review and may not be as meaningful as a review conducted by an unaffiliated broker-dealer;  the lack of separate legal representation for us and our General Partner and our Investment Manager and lack of arms-length negotiations regarding compensation payable to our General Partner and our Investment Manager;  we will pay fees to the General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates including the selling agent, before distributions are paid to you and other partners even if we do not generate profits;  we rely on the employees of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates;  the resolution of conflicts will be undertaken by the investment committee of our Investment Manager; and 24 Table of Contents  our General Partner will act as our tax matters partner, and will negotiate with the Internal Revenue Service to settle tax disputes that would bind us and our other partners; those negotiations might not be in your best interest given your individual tax situation. Our General Partners, our Investment Managers or their affiliates operating systems could be damaged or disrupted by events beyond their control, which could interfere with our ability to conduct our business and make us less attractive to customers as a source of equipment leases. Our ability to manage our operations and realize residual values from our leases of equipment and other investments depends on the operating systems of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates. In particular, this includes our General Partners, our Investment Managers or their affiliates computer and telecommunications and related equipment, and their ability to protect those systems against damage or disruptions from such contingencies as:  power loss;  acts of God, such as earthquakes, etc.;  telecommunications failure;  acts of terrorism;  computer intrusions; and  viruses and similar adverse events. Although our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates will implement security and protective measures, these systems could still be vulnerable. Any damage or disruption to these systems could make us less attractive to end-users as a source of equipment or other asset leases. Our General Partner and Investment Manager rely heavily on their respective key personnel to manage us, and the loss of such personnel could adversely affect us. Our success will be dependent upon our utilizing sufficient and appropriately skilled resources and personnel to manage us and our business affairs. In managing and directing the day-to-day activities and affairs and our investment decisions, our General Partner and our Investment Manager rely heavily on their respective principals. As a result, if any of their key personnel were to leave or be unable to carry out his or her present responsibilities, our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed and we may not be able to meet our investment objectives. Our Investment Managers investment committee is not independent. Any conflicts in determining and allocating investments between us and our General Partner, or between us and another program managed by our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates will be resolved by our Investment Managers investment committee, which also will serve as the investment committee for other funds managed by our Investment Manager. Since all of the members of our Investment Managers investment committee are officers of our General Partner, and are not independent, matters determined by the investment committee, including conflicts of interest between us and our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates involving investment opportunities, may not be as favorable to you and our other partners as they would be if independent members were on the committee. Generally, if an investment is appropriate for more than one program, our Investment Manager and its investment committee will allocate the investment to a program (which includes us) after taking into consideration at least the following factors:  which program has been seeking investments for the longest period of time;  whether the program has the cash required for the investment;  whether the amount of debt to be incurred with respect to the investment is acceptable for the program;  the effect the investment would have on the programs cash flow; 25 Table of Contents  whether the investment would further diversify, or unduly concentrate, the programs investments in a particular lessee or borrower, class or type of equipment, location, industry, etc.; and  whether the term of the investment is within the term of the program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Investment Manager and its investment committee may make exceptions to these general policies when, in our Investment Managers judgment, other circumstances make application of these policies inequitable or uneconomic. Also, under our partnership agreement our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates may engage in equipment acquisitions, refinancing, leasing and releasing opportunities on their own behalf or on behalf of other partnerships, even if they compete with us. We, our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates do not have independent audit and compensation committees. Although our General Partner believes that the fees and other compensation we will pay to it, our Investment Manager and their affiliates are reasonable and competitive in the industry, they were established by our General Partner and were not determined by an independent compensation committee composed of persons who are not affiliates of our General Partner. Also, our General Partner and our Investment Manager, rather than an independent audit committee composed of persons who are not affiliates of either our General Partner or our Investment Manager, will select our independent registered public accounting firm and supervise the preparation of our audited financial statements included in our annual reports to you. See the Management Compensation and Reports to Limited Partners sections of this prospectus. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business. After our first full year of operations, our General Partner will be required to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting in order to allow management to report on, and if and when required, our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the SEC hereunder, which we refer to as Section 404. During the course of testing, our General Partner may identify deficiencies that it may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, our General Partner and its affiliates may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel. Our Investment Manager may have difficulty managing its growth, which may divert its resources and limit its ability to expand its operations successfully. The amount of assets that our Investment Manager manages has grown substantially since our Investment Manager was formed in December 2007, and our Investment Manager intends to continue to sponsor funds similar to us, which may be concurrent with us, and our Investment Manager expects to experience further growth in their respective assets under management. Our Investment Managers future success will depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to implement and improve its operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, and manage a growing number of assets and investment funds. Our Investment Manager, however, may not implement improvements to its management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in its existing 26 Table of Contents systems and controls. Thus, our Investment Managers anticipated growth may place a strain on its administrative and operations infrastructure, which could increase its costs and reduce its efficiency and could negatively impact our operating results. Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates may receive expense reimbursements and fees from us and those reimbursements and fees are likely to exceed the income portion of distributions made to you during our early years. Before making any distributions to you and our other partners, we may reimburse our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates for expenses incurred on our behalf, and pay our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates fees for selling our units and acquiring, managing, and realizing our investments for us, regardless of whether we are profitable. The expense reimbursements and fees of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates were established by our General Partner and, are not based on arms-length negotiations, but are subject to the limitations set forth in our partnership agreement. Nevertheless, the amount of these expense reimbursements and fees is likely to exceed the income portion of distributions made to you in the early years of our term. In general, expense reimbursements and fees will be paid without regard to the amount of our cash distributions to you and our other partners, and regardless of the success or profitability of our operations. For example, after we receive our minimum offering proceeds and begin operations, our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates may be entitled to certain fees and expense reimbursements. Some of those fees and expense reimbursements may be paid at the time of the Initial Closing in this offering or as we acquire our portfolio and we may pay other expenses, such as accounting and interest expenses, costs for supplies, etc., even though we may not yet have begun to receive revenues from our investments. Risks Associated With the Tax Treatment of Our Units You may be required to pay taxes on income from us, even if you do not receive commensurate cash distributions from us. Generally, you will be required to pay federal income taxes, and probably state and local income taxes, on your share of our taxable income, regardless of whether or not you receive cash distributions from us. For example, your share of our taxable income could exceed the amount of cash that we distribute to you if we repay the principal of any debt we incur with our rental or interest income or net proceeds from the sale of our investments. This could happen because repaying the principal amount of a debt reduces the amount of cash available for distribution to you and our other partners, but is not tax deductible. Thus, your cash distributions from us may not equal your share of our taxable income or even equal your tax liability resulting from that income. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Our Income Versus Our Distributions section of this prospectus. We will not apply for an advance ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to any federal tax consequence of an investment in us, and if the Internal Revenue Service classifies us as a corporation you will lose tax benefits. We will not apply for an advance ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as to whether we will be treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes or with respect to any other tax consequence to you of an investment in us. Instead, we intend to rely on the opinion of our special tax counsel, Troutman Sanders LLP, that we will be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Opinion of Counsel section of this prospectus. If the IRS were to successfully contend that we should be treated as a publicly traded partnership, then we would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes rather than a partnership. This would have the following principal consequences to you:  tax losses realized by us would not pass through to you;  we would be taxed at income tax rates applicable to corporations, which would reduce our cash distributions to you and our other partners; and 27 Table of Contents  our distributions to you and our other partners would be taxable to you and our other limited partners as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. To reduce the possibility that the IRS could successfully contend that our units are publicly-traded, Section 13.2 of our partnership agreement places substantial restrictions on your ability to transfer your units. With respect to our tax status as a partnership, see the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Opinion of Counsel,  Taxation of Limited Partnerships in General, and  Publicly Traded Partnerships sections of this prospectus. We could lose cost recovery or depreciation deductions if the IRS treats our operating leases as sales or financings. We intend to claim cost recovery or depreciation deductions on the equipment subject to our operating leases, but not the equipment subject to our full payout leases or other investments. In this regard, we anticipate that some portion of our leases will be operating leases and others will be full payout leases. In addition, our equipment and other assets may be financed for others under secured financings. If the IRS were to successfully contend that our operating leases were actually sales, including full payout leases or other investments, rather than operating leases, we would not be entitled to cost recovery or depreciation deductions with respect to the equipment covered by those leases. See the Investment Objectives and Strategies  Equipment and Other Assets for Lease to End-Users section of this prospectus. The IRS could also challenge our method of calculating our cost recovery or depreciation deductions, or our other deductions, and the amount of our deductions could be reduced if we were audited. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Tax Treatment of Leases,  Cost Recovery, and  Limitations on Cost Recovery Deductions sections of this prospectus. You will need passive income in order to deduct any tax losses we may generate. Because our operations generally will be treated as passive activities by you and our other partners, your share of any tax losses we generate will likely be passive losses which you may use on your personal federal income tax returns only to offset passive income you receive from us or from other passive activities (other than publicly-traded partnerships) in which you invest, if any, in calculating your personal federal income tax liability. For example, you cannot use a passive loss from us to offset any active (i.e., non-passive) income, such as your salary, on your personal federal income tax returns. In addition, a portion of your share of our gross income might be treated for federal income tax purposes as portfolio income or gross income that is not from a passive activity, which cannot be offset by passive losses. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Deductibility of Losses; Passive Activity Losses, Tax Basis and At Risk Limitation section of this prospectus. You will likely be subject to state and local taxes as a result of purchasing our units. You will likely be subject to state and local taxes imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property. It is your responsibility to file all of your personal federal, state and local tax returns. Our special tax counsel has not given any opinion on the state or local tax consequences of an investment in us. We urge you to seek advice based on your particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor with respect to the state and local tax consequences of purchasing our units. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  State and Local Taxation section of this prospectus. An IRS audit of our annual federal information tax return may result in adjustments to, or an audit of, your personal income tax returns. We anticipate incurring tax losses during at least our early years due primarily to depreciation of equipment leased to others under our operating leases, and operating expenses. Also, we may be required to file disclosure reports with the IRS and its Office of Tax Shelter Analysis if the tax results of our intended activities cause us to be a reportable transaction under the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations. Our anticipated tax losses and any reportable transaction reports to the IRS would increase the 28 Table of Contents risk of an IRS audit of our federal information income tax returns, and could result in an IRS audit of your personal federal income tax returns. Also, any adjustments to our returns required by the IRS could require you to make corresponding adjustments on your personal federal income tax returns. In addition, an IRS audit of your personal federal income tax return could include an examination by the IRS of your returns for prior years, and could cover items unrelated to your investment in us. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Audit by the IRS and  Registrations; Reportable Transactions, Interest and Penalties sections of this prospectus. Your investment in us may cause you to pay alternative minimum tax. You may have to pay alternative minimum tax as a result of your investment in us, because you will be allocated a share of our alternative minimum tax preference and adjustment items. For example, depreciation or cost recovery deductions of equipment subject to our operating leases generally are computed differently for regular federal income tax purposes than for alternative minimum tax purposes. This would increase your alternative minimum taxable income, as compared to your regular taxable income, during the early years of the applicable cost recovery or depreciation period of the equipment subject to our operating leases. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Alternative Minimum Tax section of this prospectus. IRAs and tax-exempt organizations may have unrelated business taxable income from an investment in us. Tax-exempt organizations, such as pension plans, IRAs, and certain types of foreign entities or persons are potentially subject to tax on UBTI. Although rental and interest income generally are not included in UBTI, our General Partner anticipates that most of your income, if any, from an investment in us could constitute UBTI, because of a special rule in the Internal Revenue Code that treats such income as UBTI to the extent it is attributable to equipment leases. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Taxation of Tax-Exempt Organizations section of this prospectus. Foreign investors in us will be subject to U.S. Tax withholding. We generally will be required to withhold federal income tax at the highest applicable rate under the Internal Revenue Code on the income, if any, we allocate to units owned by foreign investors, regardless of whether any corresponding cash distributions are made to them. If too much tax is withheld, foreign investors will have to file U.S. income tax returns to seek a refund. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences section of this prospectus. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS Certain statements within this prospectus, including statements contained in the sections entitled Prospectus Summary, Risk Factors, Investment Objectives and Strategies, and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, contain forward-looking statements concerning our objectives, plans, intentions, strategies, expectations and predictions concerning our future investment activities, results of operations and other future events or conditions based on views and opinions of our General Partner and our Investment Manager. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as believes, may, will, could, intends, anticipates, estimates, expects or might, or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include such things as:  investment objectives;  references to future operating results, credit availability and financial success;  business strategy;  estimated future capital expenditures;  competitive strengths and goals; and 29 Table of Contents  other similar matters. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us, our General Partner and our Investment Manager in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments. However, whether actual results will conform with these expectations is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Such risks include, but are not limited to, those described under the Risk Factors section of this prospectus and the following:  changes in economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment or other assets, interest rates and inflation rates;  the quality of equipment and other assets we acquire and lease or finance;  the continuing strength of equipment and other manufacturers;  the timing of our equipment and other asset purchases and our ability to forecast technological advances;  technological and economic obsolescence of the equipment and other assets we acquire;  defaults by our lessees or other counterparties; and  increases in our expenses. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we cannot assure investors that our expectations will be attained or that any deviations will not be material. You are cautioned that forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and that, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect any future events or circumstances. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to individuals acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES General Our General Partner and our Investment Manager may be subject to various conflicts of interest arising out of their relationship to us. Because of our General Partners and our Investment Managers organizational and operational control over us, these conflicts will not be resolved through arms-length negotiations but, rather, through the exercise of our General Partners and Investment Managers judgment consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities to you and us. Some provisions of our partnership agreement are designed to protect the interests of you and our other partners if conflicts arise. In this regard, you should read Article IX of our partnership agreement and, in particular, Section 9.5. These sections do the following:  limit the actions our General Partner may take on our behalf;  limit the compensation and fees we will pay our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates; and  limit the expenses for which we will reimburse our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates. However, our partnership agreement does not necessarily directly respond to each potential conflict, and there will be no established mechanism to resolve these conflicts. In these situations, our Investment Manager will rely solely on its judgment, subject to its fiduciary duties, to resolve the conflict. The potential conflicts include those set forth below. 30 Table of Contents Our General Partner, Our Investment Manager and Their Affiliates Will Receive Fees and Other Substantial Compensation From Us We will pay fees and other substantial compensation to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates. Further, we may reimburse our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates for costs incurred by them in managing us and our portfolio. Subject to its fiduciary duties and the terms of our partnership agreement, our Investment Manager has sole discretion with respect to the terms and timing of our investments, although it is anticipated that those investments will be consistent with our investment objectives and policies. The agreements and arrangements, including those relating to compensation, between us and our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates are not the result of arms-length negotiations and may create conflicts between the interests of our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates on the one hand and us and our partners on the other. However, our General Partner believes that the compensation and fees provided for in our partnership agreement are consistent with practices in the industry and the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines in effect as of on the date of this prospectus. Actions Taken by Our General Partner and Our Investment Manager Will Affect the Amount of Cash Available for Distribution to Limited Partners and Our General Partners and Investment Managers Compensation The amount of cash we have available for distribution to you and our other partners will be affected by decisions of our General Partner and our Investment Manager regarding various matters, including:  the amount and timing of asset and equipment purchases and sales;  cash expenditures;  financing; and  the creation, reduction or increase of reserves. See the Management Compensation section of this prospectus beginning on page 10. Our General Partner will be liable for our obligations to the extent that they exceed our assets. As a result, our General Partner has the right to cause us to establish and maintain cash reserves that it believes are necessary to meet our obligations. Because our General Partner may be exposed to liability to our creditors if our reserves are insufficient to pay our contingent liabilities, our General Partner may have a conflict of interest in allocating our cash flow between distributions to you and our other partners or to our reserve accounts. To the extent that our General Partner increases the amount of cash it allocates to reserves, the amount of cash available for distributions to you and our other partners will decrease and our General Partners exposure to our contingent liabilities may be lessened. Our General Partner, Our Investment Manager and Their Affiliates Will Engage in Activities That Compete With Us Our partnership agreement does not prohibit our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates from investing in, acquiring or leasing equipment or other assets, and they will continue to engage in equipment and other asset acquisitions, leasing and re-leasing opportunities on their own behalf or on behalf of other partnerships or entities. None of our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates may, however, publicly offer for sale interests in more than one direct participation program simultaneously unless the programs:  have different investment objectives; or  are specified equipment programs, as defined under relevant securities regulations or state securities guidelines. 31 Table of Contents Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates have the right to take for their own accounts, or to recommend to any program they manage, any particular investment opportunity, subject to the limitations set forth in our partnership agreement. Any conflicts in determining and allocating investments between us and our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates, or between us and another program managed by our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates, will be resolved by our Investment Managers investment committee, which also serves as SQN I and SQN IIs investment committee as discussed in the Management  Investment Committee section of this prospectus beginning on page 40. Generally, if an investment is appropriate for more than one program our Investment Managers investment committee will allocate the investment to a program (which includes us) after taking into consideration at least the following factors:  which program has been seeking investments for the longest period of time;  whether the program has the cash required for the investment;  whether the amount of debt to be incurred with respect to the investment is acceptable for the program;  the effect the investment would have on the programs cash flow;  whether the investment would further diversify, or unduly concentrate, the programs investments in a particular lessee, class or type of equipment or other asset, location, industry, etc.; and  whether the term of the investment is within the term of the program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Investment Managers investment committee may make exceptions to these general policies when, in its judgment, other circumstances make application of these policies inequitable or uneconomic. We May Enter Into Joint Ventures With Affiliated Programs We may invest in joint ventures with other programs that are sponsored by our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates. These investments may result in conflicts of interest resulting from the differing financial positions of the co-venturers. For example, it may be in the interest of one entity to sell jointly-held equipment while it may be in the interest of the other entity to continue holding the equipment. However, we will not participate in a joint venture unless:  we and the other program have substantially similar investment objectives;  we and the other program invest on substantially the same terms;  there are no duplicate fees;  our General Partners compensation in us and the other program is substantially the same;  we have the right of first refusal to buy any investment the other program wants to sell; and  the joint venture is entered into either for the purpose of effecting appropriate diversification for us and the other program, or for the purpose of relieving our General Partner or its affiliates from a commitment entered into for the purposes of: - facilitating our acquisition of equipment or other assets or investments; or - any other lawful purpose related to our business. Notwithstanding, there may be an impasse on joint venture decisions since neither we nor the other program will have complete control over the joint ventures equipment and, although we will have the right to buy the equipment from the other joint venturer in the event of a sale, we may not have the resources do so. 32 Table of Contents We Do Not Have Any Employees and Rely on the Employees of Our General Partner, Our Investment Manager and Their Affiliates We will not have any independent employees or officers, and will rely solely on our General Partner and Investment Manager to manage us and our operations. Our General Partner and our Investment Manager will provide us with those administrative services necessary for our prudent operation in accordance with the terms of our partnership agreement. Those employees are not required to spend all of their time on affairs which effect us and in fact may devote significant time to the affairs of our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates and will be compensated by our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates for those services. The availability or lack thereof of these employees to provide services to us may create significant conflicts between us and our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates. We May Reimburse Our General Partner, Our Investment Manager and Their Affiliates for Expenses We may reimburse our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates for costs incurred by them in managing us and our portfolio, including specified costs incurred by them in providing corporate staff and support services properly allocable to us. See the Management Compensation section of this prospectus beginning on page 10. We Have Not Retained Separate Counsel or Other Professionals Troutman Sanders LLP, the legal counsel that represents our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates, including the selling agent, also represents us. You and our other limited partners, as a group, have not been represented by legal counsel. Prospective investors should seek independent counsel if they so desire or if any legal matters discussed in this prospectus are unclear. Lack of Independent Underwriter and Due Diligence Investigation in This Offering No independent lead underwriter has been engaged for the distribution of our units. Therefore, we will not have the benefit of an independent due diligence review and investigation of the type normally performed by an unaffiliated, independent lead underwriter in connection with an offering of securities. Although the selling agent believes that its investigation of us, our General Partner and our Investment Manager for purposes of this offering of units has been as complete as would be the case in dealing with unaffiliated parties, there is no assurance that the due diligence has been performed in the same manner as that of an independent lead underwriter. Conflicts Regarding Redemption of Units You and our other partners may present your units to us for redemption at any time. This creates the following conflicts of interest between you and our General Partner:  We have no obligation to redeem your units at any time for any reason. Our General Partner may decline your redemption request in its sole discretion. For example, if our General Partner determines that we do not have the necessary cash flow, taking into account future distributions to our other partners and foreseeable investments, reinvestments, and operating expenses, your request may be declined. In addition, our General Partner may conclude that the requested redemption might cause our total unit transfers in the year to exceed 2% of our total capital or profits interests, which is not permitted under our partnership agreement. See Appendix A to this prospectus. All of these determinations will be made in our General Partners sole discretion.  Our General Partner also has determined the redemption price of our units. To the extent the redemption price, or the provisions for determining the redemption price in certain circumstances, includes any subjective decisions, they will fall within the discretion of our General Partner. See the Redemption of Units section of this prospectus beginning on page 88. 33 Table of Contents Our General Partner is Our Tax Matters Partner Our General Partner will serve as our tax matters partner and represent us before the IRS and all other taxing authorities. As tax matters partner, our General Partner will have broad authority to act on behalf of you and our other partners in any administrative or judicial proceeding involving the IRS or other tax agencies, and this authority may involve conflicts of interest. For example, a potential conflict would include whether to contest or settle a proposed adjustment by the IRS to the amount of our depreciation deductions under our operating leases, which are allocated 99% to you and our other partners, which would also affect your personal income tax returns. While our General Partner will take into account the interests of you and our other partners as a whole, there is no assurance that any settlement would be in the best interest of you or any other particular partner given your or his particular tax situation. Our General Partner or Its Affiliates Will Purchase Units as Investors Our General Partner or its affiliates currently intend to purchase 100 units. These subscriptions will not be included in the minimum number of units required for us to begin operations. Thus these partners generally will:  share in our income, losses and distributions on the same basis as you and our other partners as described in the Income, Losses and Distributions section of this prospectus beginning on page 57; and  have the same voting rights, except that they are prohibited from voting on the removal of our General Partner as general partner and the appointment of a successor general partner. The purchase of units by our General Partner, its officers, directors, or other affiliates as limited partners will dilute the voting rights of you and our other partners and there may be a conflict with respect to certain matters. See the Summary of Our Partnership Agreement  Voting Rights of Limited Partners section of this prospectus beginning on page 85. General Restrictions To reduce, but not eliminate, certain conflicts of interest we will not:  issue any units after this offering terminates or issue units in exchange for property;  make loans to our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates;  receive loans from our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates unless the loan has a term of 12 months or less from the date on which it was made and any interest or other financing charges or fees we pay do not exceed the lower of the following:  if our General Partner, our Investment Manager or an affiliate borrowed to make the loan, the rate of interest and other amounts paid or payable by our General Partner, our Investment Manager or the affiliate in connection with the borrowing; or  if our General Partner, our Investment Manager or an affiliate did not borrow to make the loan, the rate of interest and other amounts paid or payable in an arms-length borrowing that we could obtain, without reference to our General Partners, our Investment Managers or the affiliates financial abilities or guarantees;  invest in or underwrite the securities of other partnership programs;  operate in a manner that would cause us to be classified as an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;  grant our General Partner, our Investment Manager or any of their affiliates exclusive listing rights to sell our investments or other assets; 34 Table of Contents  permit our General Partner, our Investment Manager or any of their affiliates to receive a fee or commission in connection with the reinvestment of our cash from sales or operations, or the resale, re-lease, exchange or refinancing of equipment, except as permitted by our partnership agreement and in the Management Compensation section of this prospectus beginning on page 10;  grant our General Partner, our Investment Manager or any of their affiliates any rebates or give-ups or participate in any reciprocal business arrangements with them that would circumvent the restrictions in our partnership agreement, including the restrictions applicable to transactions with affiliates of our General Partner;  permit our General Partner, directly or indirectly, to pay or award any commissions or other compensation to any person engaged by a potential investor for investment advice as an inducement to the advisor to advise the purchaser of our units; but this does not prohibit the normal sales commissions and other compensation payable to the selling agent as described in the Plan of Distribution section of this prospectus beginning on page 92;  purchase or lease any equipment or other asset from, or sell or lease equipment or other assets to our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates or any investment program in which they have an interest. However, if the conditions set forth below are met, we expect that we will acquire substantially all of our equipment and other assets from our Investment Manager or its affiliates (other than affiliated equipment leasing and finance programs), provided that they acquire the equipment or other assets on a temporary or interim basis in order to facilitate our acquisition of the equipment or other assets or our financing needs. The conditions referred to above are the following:  our Investment Manager or its affiliates hold the equipment or other assets only on an interim basis, generally not longer than six months, for purposes of facilitating their acquisition by us, borrowing money or obtaining financing for us or for other purposes related to our business;  our Investment Manager determines that the acquisition of equipment or other assets is in our best interest;  we acquire the equipment or other assets at a price no greater than the cost to our Investment Manager or its affiliates, as adjusted for intervening operations, plus compensation permitted under our partnership agreement and described in this prospectus;  there is no difference in the interest terms of any financing secured by the equipment or other assets at the time acquired by our Investment Manager or its affiliates, and the time acquired by us, although there may be different interest terms if the applicable financing is provided through a different credit facility or different lender; and  our Investment Manager or its affiliates do not benefit from the transaction apart from compensation permitted under our partnership agreement and described in this prospectus. See the  We May Enter Into Joint Ventures With Affiliated Programs above and the Investment Objectives and Strategies  Management, Origination and Servicing Agreement section of this prospectus beginning on page 56. Also, except as permitted under the Management, Origination and Servicing Agreement and our partnership agreement, our General Partner may not enter into any other agreements, contracts or arrangements on our behalf with itself or any of its affiliates. It is likely that our Investment Manager will manage the investments of other equipment leasing funds in the future. Investment opportunities may arise which are suitable both for us and for those other equipment leasing funds. In those cases, when allocating investment opportunities between us and other equipment leasing funds it manages, our Investment Manager will take into consideration factors which include the following:  specified equipment programs will have first preference for investment opportunities which meet their investment guidelines; 35 Table of Contents  the period of time in which the funds have been seeking investments;  the size of the investment opportunity and the cash available to the funds to make such an investment;  the extent to which the investment will contribute to each fund meeting its investment objectives, including the objective of portfolio diversification;  the duration of the investment and the remaining duration of each fund; and  the anticipated cash flow and performance effect of the investment on each fund. These considerations will not restrict our Investment Manager or its affiliates or other funds managed by our Investment Manager or its affiliates from considering or accepting investment opportunities. Fiduciary Duty of Our General Partner Our General Partner is accountable to us as a fiduciary. Under Delaware law, this generally means that our General Partner has duties of due care and fair dealing in acting for us and handling our affairs. Our partnership agreement does not excuse our General Partner from liability or provide it with any defenses for breach of its fiduciary duty. However, our partnership agreement permits our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates to have business interests or activities that may conflict with ours, and includes provisions to resolve conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and other programs that may be sponsored by our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates. The fiduciary duty owed by a general partner is analogous to the fiduciary duty owed by directors to a corporation and its stockholders and is subject to the same rule, commonly referred to as the business judgment rule. Under this rule, directors are not liable for mistakes made in the good faith exercise of honest business judgment or for losses incurred in the good faith performance of their duties when performed with such care as an ordinarily prudent person would use. Under the terms of our partnership agreement our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates have limited their liability to us and to you and our other partners for any loss suffered by us or by you and our other partners that arises out of any action or inaction on their part if:  they determined in good faith that the course of conduct was in our best interest;  they were acting on behalf of, or performing services for, us; and  their course of conduct did not constitute negligence or misconduct. This is a rapidly developing and changing area of the law and if you have questions concerning the duties of our General Partner you should consult with your legal counsel. In addition, as permitted by Delaware law and as discussed above, we will indemnify our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates against any loss of the kind described in the preceding sentences to the extent of our assets, but without any additional obligation on the part of you and our other partners. However, we will not indemnify our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates for any violation, or alleged violation, of federal or state securities laws unless:  there has been a judgment on the merits in favor of our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates or the claims were dismissed on the merits by the court;  the court has been advised by us of the position of the SEC and applicable state securities law authorities on the issue of indemnification for securities law violations; and  the court approves the indemnification of litigation and/or settlement costs. The effect of the foregoing provisions may be to limit your recourse to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates. However, you should be aware that, in the SECs opinion, the indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable. 36 Table of Contents The Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that a limited partner may institute legal action (a derivative action) on a partnerships behalf to recover damages from a third-party when the general partner refuses to institute the action or where an effort to cause the general partner to do so is not likely to succeed. In addition, the statutory or case law may permit a limited partner to institute legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated limited partners (a class action) to recover damages from a general partner for violations of its fiduciary duties to the limited partners. In addition, we will not incur the cost of that portion of any insurance that insures any party against any liability the indemnification of which is prohibited under our partnership agreement; provided, however, that with respect to public liability insurance obtained by us in connection with any of our equipment, other assets, leases or business operations, our General Partner is permitted to add itself and its affiliates as additional insureds thereunder so long as, and to the extent that, our General Partner or its affiliates pays for the resulting incremental premium costs. For this purpose, public liability insurance includes insurance that would cover damage to property or personal injury to non-affiliated persons incurred during the performance of services related to us and our operations. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT Our General Partner Our General Partner is SQN AIF III GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with offices at 48 Wall Street, 24 th Floor, New York, New York 10005.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES Principal Investment Objectives Our principal objectives are to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and Other Physical Assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. Many of our investments will be structured as full payout or operating equipment leases. In addition, we intend to invest by way of participation agreements and residual sharing agreements where we would acquire an interest in a pool of equipment or other assets, or rights to that equipment or other assets, at a future date. We also may structure investments as project financings that are secured by, among other things, essential use equipment and/or assets. Finally, we may use other investment structures that our Investment Manager believes will provide us the appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize our return on investment while protecting against downside risk. In most cases, the structure will include us holding title to or a priority position in the equipment or other asset. Principal Investment Strategies We will focus our investments in business-essential, revenue-producing equipment and other assets with high in-place value and long (relative to the investment term) economic life. We will acquire investments (i) originated and warehoused by certain affiliates of our Investment Manager; (ii) originated directly by us; or (iii) originated from brokers or other leasing/investment companies or banks. Originating an investment involves, among other things, identifying a lessee or other end-user, inspecting the equipment or other asset, undertaking a business, credit, and industry review, projecting the residual value of the equipment or other asset, pricing the investment, and documenting the transaction. When we acquire investments from an affiliate of our Investment Manager, such affiliate will likely perform all of these originating services and fund the transaction directly. In this situation, subject to the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, we will purchase the investment in the same way that the investments have been sold to third parties which have historically yielded investors an above average return. Additionally, the affiliate will take a first loss position as a co-investor to our benefit. When we originate a transaction, our Investment Manager will perform these originating services on our behalf and we will fund the transaction directly. 45 Table of Contents For equipment and other assets that have a minimum economic life of six to ten years, the typical investment term will be three to five years. Each investment will typically be a hell or high water, triple-net lease that requires the lessee or other counterparty to bear all tax, maintenance, insurance, and other costs related to the lease or the operation of the underlying equipment or other asset. The contract provisions governing the investment will require that the end-user carry insurance covering all insurable damage that could occur to the equipment or other assets, including total loss insurance. We will concentrate on transaction sizes below $10.0 million with a maximum equity investment of $3.0 million, or 10% of the total proceeds raised in this offering, whichever is higher. By doing so, we will be operating in areas with limited competition. We have made the decision to limit our size, in terms of the maximum offering proceeds, to $50.0 million so that we may be selective in choosing our investments. We will focus our investments on specific industries and asset types where the members or officers of our Investment Manager have extensive expertise and a deep and well developed sales and remarketing network. Our Investment Manager will focus on identifying equipment and other assets that are considered essential use or core to a business or operation in the agricultural, energy, environmental, medical, manufacturing, technology, and transportation industries. Our Investment Manager also may identify other assets or industries that meet our investment objectives such as modular accommodations. We will invest in a combination of single investor and leveraged transactions in the United States, Canada and the European Union. We intend to invest in as much as $200.0 million of original equipment or other asset cost. Single investor transactions will generally be leases in which we will pay 100% of the equipment or other asset cost. In a single investor lease, we receive 100% of the lease payments over the term of the lease. On leveraged transactions, we will use debt, by way of receivable sales, to finance a portion of the equipment or other asset cost. In such cases, we may pledge all or a portion of the contractual payments of the end-user to the lender to amortize the debt. At the end of the original term, the debt should be paid off in full and we should hold unencumbered title to the equipment or other assets. Using leverage of this nature allows us to invest in larger, higher-yielding transactions while minimizing our risks and increasing our investment diversification. In both single investor and leveraged transactions, it is our objective that the original term payments pay down all or substantially all of the original equipment or other asset cost and, in some cases, with a rate of return before the residual value is taken into account. The residual value is the projected market value of the equipment or other asset at the end of the original term. At the end of the original term of most leases or other form of investment, the end-user will have three options: (1) Extend the term for an agreed upon rental amount which may be for the same amount or a discounted amount. In some cases, such as in vessels or modular building transactions, the extension rate may be higher than the original rate. (2) Purchase the equipment or other assets from us at an agreed price. (3) Return the equipment or other assets to us which includes, among other things, records, manuals, power cables, and all components. There are also certain usage standards that have to be met otherwise the end-user must pay a stipulated loss amount for the condition of the equipment or other assets. In many cases it is not economical for them to return the equipment or other assets. Some contracts will have pre-negotiated end term provisions setting the price for an extension or sale. Many contracts will be open-ended or have fair market value (FMV) end term provisions. In all cases, this is taken into account in pricing the investment. We will realize the majority of our returns from the residual value of the equipment or other assets. Based on historical experience, our Investment Manager expects to begin to distribute returns on capital between years three and five and expects us to conclude within five to seven years from the first closing date of this offering. As discussed above, certain affiliates of our Investment Manager will regularly originate transactions and offer to sell all or part of such transactions to us either individually or as a portfolio depending upon, among 46 Table of Contents other things, the appropriateness of the proposed investment for us (as determined by our Investment Manager, in its sole discretion) and the amount available for investment by us at such time. During the Operating Period, we will have a right of first refusal, subject to the existing rights of SQN I and SQN II (which will be in different stages in their respective investment cycles), on all transactions originated by affiliates of our Investment Manager that meet our investment objectives. In the event an affiliate of our Investment Manager proposes to sell an asset or portfolio of assets (or a participation interest therein or any other suitable investment) to us, we may purchase such asset or portfolio of assets (or a participation interest therein or any other suitable investment) from our General Partner or any of its affiliates (but not including an affiliated program) if:  our General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, that making the investment is in our best interests;  the investment is purchased by us a purchase price that does not exceed the sum of: - the cost to our General Partner or its affiliate of acquiring and holding the investment (as determined under GAAP and as adjusted for any income received, capital or investment returned and reasonable and necessary expenses paid or incurred while holding the investment); plus - any compensation to which the General Partner and any affiliate of our General Partner is entitled to under our partnership agreement;  there is no difference in the interest terms of any indebtedness secured by the investment at the time it is acquired by our General Partner or its affiliate and the time the investment is acquired by us, although there may be different interest terms if the applicable financing is provided through a different credit facility or different lender;  neither our General Partner nor any affiliate of our General Partner receives any other benefit, other than compensation permitted by our partnership agreement, as a result of us purchasing the investment; and  at the time of transfer of the investment to us, our General Partner or its affiliate had held the investment on a temporary or interim basis (generally not longer than six months) for the purposes of: - facilitating the acquisition of the investment by us; or - any other lawful purpose related to our business. Our Investment Manager intends to structure each of our investments at a price that it determines will provide a present value return to us, including the estimated residual value of the equipment which may or may not be fully realized by us. However, our Investment Manager may not be successful in achieving our investment objectives. We plan to make semi-annual distributions of cash to you and our other partners, if, in our Investment Managers opinion, such distributions are in our best interests. We expect to begin distributions in the sixth month of the Operating Period and thereafter, every six months during the Operating Period. However, we cannot assure you of the following:  that our distributions to you and our other limited partners will be in any specific amount; or  when our distributions to you and our other limited partners will be made. We also expect that during the early years of our operations our distributions to you and our other limited partners will be substantially tax-deferred. See the Risk Factors, and Income, Losses and Distributions  Timing of Distributions sections of this prospectus. 47 Table of Contents Equipment and Other Assets for Lease to EndUsers We will purchase equipment and other assets for lease to end-users. We expect that the cost per unit of the equipment or other asset we purchase generally will range from $50,000 to $3.0 million and the average per unit cost will be between $400,000 and $1.5 million. In addition to other investments, we will enter into both full payout leases and operating leases.  Full payout leases generally are leases under which the rent over the initial term of the lease will return our invested capital plus an appropriate return without consideration of the residual value, and where the lessee may acquire the equipment or other assets at the end of the lease term.  Operating leases generally are leases under which the aggregate noncancellable rental payments during the original term of the lease, on a net present value basis, are not sufficient to recover the purchase price of the equipment or other assets leased under the lease. We are not limited as to type of leases we may enter into and, as a result, either operating leases or full payout leases could possibly constitute most of our portfolio. Equipment and Other Assets Already Subject to Lease We also may acquire portfolios of equipment or other assets subject to existing leases from our General Partners or our Investment Managers respective affiliates or independent third-parties. We anticipate that at the end of this offering our purchased portfolio of existing leases probably will not exceed 30% of our total investments. While the per unit cost range and average per unit cost for the equipment or other asset will depend on the existing portfolios of leases we may select for purchase, we anticipate that these costs may be less, and possibly materially less, than the cost of investments that we originate directly or through affiliates of our General Partner or our Investment Manager. Types of Equipment and Other Assets We expect that we will focus on equipment and other assets to invest in that are essential for businesses to conduct their operations so that the endusers will be highly motivated to make the required payments in order to keep the equipment or other assets in place during the initial term and afterward. We will particularly focus on business-essential equipment or other assets in the following areas: Equipment/Asset Category Example Equipment/Asset Agricultural Intermediate bulk containers that are used to transport and store fluids and bulk materials Medical Magnetic resonance imaging machines Manufacturing Machine tools and production line facilities Technological IT infrastructure Transportation Marine vessels Energy Hydro-electric turbines Environmental Waste management equipment; Anaerobic digestion Other Modular accommodations Market Equipment leasing and asset finance are methods by which companies access capital to sustain, grow, or improve their businesses and operations. Often, equipment leasing provides companies with the lowest cost means to acquire revenue generating or other business essential assets. Companies choose to lease or finance assets for a variety of different reasons including, but not limited to, cash flow management, preservation of working capital, off balance sheet treatment, the ability to pass the cost off to customers, and/or flexibility of capital equipment management. 48 Table of Contents Industry Participants and Segments We group domestic lease providers into the four major categories set forth below:  Banks  companies that are either majority owned by, or affiliated with, a bank.  Industrial  companies that are majority owned by an industrial or non-financial services parent company.  Independent  public or privately owned and operated finance companies that offer leases or loans directly to businesses and are not affiliated with any particular manufacturer or dealer.  Captive  companies that are primarily engaged in supporting the financing or leasing of a parent companys products. Industry and Market Data The industry and market data contained in this prospectus are based on independent industry publications, reports by governmental agencies or market research firms or other published independent sources and, in each case, are believed by us to be reasonable estimates. However, industry and market data is subject to change and cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey. We have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party sources. In addition, consumption patterns and customer preferences can and do change. As a result, you should be aware that market share, ranking and other similar data set forth herein, and estimates and beliefs based on that data, may not be verifiable or reliable. The industry and market data sources are publicly available and were not prepared for our benefit or paid for by us, nor were they paid by or prepared for the benefit of our General Partners or our Investment Managers affiliates. Equipment Leasing Figures The following figures provide an overview of features of the equipment leasing industry:  Annual world leasing volume is in excess of $760 billion. 1  North America comprises approximately 38.0% of annual world leasing volume, Europe 41.1% and Asia 14.7%. 1  The top 15 countries, measured by way of annual leasing volume (in parentheses), are as follows: U.S.($188 billion), Germany ($80 billion), Japan ($63 billion), Italy ($45 billion), France ($45 billion), Russia ($34 billion), Spain ($30 billion), Brazil ($29 billion), Canada ($25 billion), United Kingdom ($25 billion), Poland ($16 billion), Sweden ($12 billion), Netherlands ($12 billion), Switzerland ($12 billion) and Australia ($11 billion).  Since 1988, the global aggregate annual leasing volume has grown from $194 billion to $760 billion. 1  In 2008, U.S. business investment in equipment and software has grown to an estimated $1.159 trillion, $657 billion of which was leasing volume. 2 1 Source: World Leasing Yearbook 2009, Euromoney Yearbooks, as of 2007. 2 Source: Equipment Leasing and Finance Association 2009 Annual Report. Competitive Conditions Our investment strategy is based on the fundamental principles of asset-backed finance. Our competitive advantage lies in our approach to equipment leasing and asset finance. Other companies have one of two investment strategies depending on their cost of capital. Companies such as GE, CIT, and major banks make lease investments based on low risk credit score models on specific equipment only. These companies earn low margins but do tremendous standardized volume and are often tax driven. Private leasing companies with higher costs of capital purchase leases in the secondary market from banks and other institutions when their 49 Table of Contents tax advantages have run their course to the original lessor. Leasing companies with a higher cost of capital generate profits through their expertise in residual pricing by buying these leases based on different assumptions of the residual value. We approach leasing as an innovative financing vehicle to provide growth capital to strong management teams with solid business models in need of revenue producing assets. We take the time to understand the underlying business in addition to having an existing expertise in the specific equipment being financed. We are not restricted to formulaic, cookie-cutter leases. We take a private equity-like approach to investing in businesses and therefore target private equity-like yields. By maintaining a small fund size and working with the equipment expertise of our affiliates, we will be investing in opportunities not sufficiently served by other leasing companies and banks simply because the detail-specific nature of the investments and the amount of capital the other companies need to put to work does not make it an efficient market for them to invest in. Our strategy is effective in all market conditions. When access to the inexpensive capital is limited, leasing provides a less capital intensive way for business owners to acquire equipment. When business cycles are strong, equipment leasing increases with the growth of businesses. Leasing and Financing Strategies We believe the key factors in establishing and maintaining our portfolio of equipment, other assets and leases are as follows:  Origination  We expect our Investment Manager (directly and through its affiliates) and possibly independent third-parties, will originate all of our investments. See Management, Origination and Servicing Agreement, below. Through an internal sales force, our Investment Manager and its affiliates will originate transactions through an established network of end-users that include small private businesses, publicly listed entities, international organizations, colleges and universities, hospitals, governments, municipalities, banks, investor groups, other leasing and finance companies and individuals. An increasing portion of new business will be generated from vendors and manufacturers with which our affiliates have established, are establishing, or will establish proprietary relationships as a funding source. We also will originate transactions from the existing customers of our affiliates and by referral.  Underwriting  Our Investment Manager along with other affiliates of our General Partner will service all of our investments. Primary underwriting on all foreign investments and secondary underwriting on certain U.S. transactions will be conducted by Summit Asset Management Ltd., an affiliate of our Investment Manager and General Partner located in the United Kingdom. Overview of our underwriting policies and procedures Our Investment Manager will be underwriting transactions from a diverse number of sources to a wide range of end-users attracting a premium return that reflects the nature of the underlying risks as well as the complexity of the transactions. The investment committee of our Investment Manager will assess risk with the intention that transactions are underwritten for the benefit of the portfolio within the specification and characteristics of the portfolio and with the intention of achieving our stated investment objectives. Investments will be made in equipment and equipment leases but also may be made in other equipment and other physical asset related transactions that allow for the direct or indirect participation in the benefits and risks of ownership or usage. Such transactions may include but are not limited to equipment trading, residual sharing agreements, forward purchase agreements, investments in companies which lease equipment, participation agreements, equipment purchase options, and other transactions involving physical assets and equipment. The key elements of risk will be identified and mitigation of those risks will be sought to secure an acceptable risk reward ratio as determined by the investment committee of our Investment Manager. 50 Table of Contents The policy and procedures identifies the ways that we will seek to minimize the risk from each transaction while enabling us to meet our strategic objectives. Summary of Policy It is the intention of the policy to ensure that there is a mix of risk that will not create an imbalance of exposure for us in any industry, asset, or credit. Individual credit exposure to a single legal body shall not exceed 10% of our total equity raised or $3.0 million whichever is the greater. There shall be no greater than 35% of total equity raised invested in a single industry. The normal investment period is expected to be between 36 and 60 months but in no event shall exceed 84 months. All transactions must be clearly summarized enabling the investment committee of our Investment Manager to understand:  the structure of the transaction;  the source of the transaction;  the documentation;  the equipment or other assets being financed and the security they represent;  how the equipment or other assets are to be acquired;  the amount of residual risk within the transaction and the expected exit route or how the residual will be recovered;  the return that we anticipate from the transaction;  how the counterparty expects to benefit from the transaction;  the risks that are inherent within the transaction;  how the counterparty expects to be able to repay all monies due under the transaction;  any additional security that is being made available to support the transaction;  any third party security interests that may affect the equipment or other assets being financed; and  all other relevant information. Financial Information The investment committee of our Investment Manager must have sufficient financial information on the lessee, guarantor or any other participant or counterparty within the transaction to enable it to make an informed decision on the ability of the parties to be able to perform their obligations required within the transaction. The investment committee of our Investment Manager typically requires the following financial information:  if available, audited financial statements for the last two years;  unaudited financial statements for the latest completed quarter;  budget or forecast for the latest fiscal year;  confirmation that current customers are up to date with their payments or proposals clearly demonstrating how arrears will be brought up to date;  details of current levels of exposure within existing transactions aggregated with the new proposal; and  details of existing credit facilities, the remaining availability and any financial covenants affecting the counterparty, lessee, guarantor, or other parties. 51 Table of Contents General Information Additional information must also be provided, when relevant, to assist in our Investment Managers assessment of the potential creditworthiness of a lessee or other counterparty including:  its structure;  its management structure and an overview of the experience of the key members of the management team;  an up to date business plan;  its marketing plan and any intelligence on its market share, market penetration and major competitors;  an analysis of its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats;  an overview of its customer base; and  details of any recent press or internet coverage. Summary of Procedure Proposal Format A proposal for all transactions should be presented for credit underwriting in a standard and consistent format containing all relevant information and a supporting summary advocating the transaction. Searches Searches will be undertaken for all companies other than for widely followed listed companies. Similarly, key directors will be checked and verified. This process should also be applied to equipment suppliers. In the event of any cash payments being made within the structure of the transaction, full compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations must be undertaken and the identities of any counterparty must be established and documented. Approval All transactions must be approved by vote of the investment committee of our Investment Manager. Jeremiah Silkowski and Neil Roberts will maintain ultimate investment discretion and will have to be in agreement on all transactions. Site Inspection All customers should be visited, at least once, at their premises either prior to the first drawdown or by way of asset inspection before funding. Reviews After the first anniversary of the funding of a transaction or the production of the final accounts of the company whichever is the later, a review of its or any guarantors creditworthiness will be undertaken. For transactions of three years or less one such review will be undertaken and for transactions of a longer duration a review will be undertaken on the second anniversary. The review summary shall recommend if any further reviews should be undertaken. Transactions that become delinquent in their payment of rentals to us for more than 30 days will be subjected to a formal review. Reviews not withstanding, all customers and credits will be continuously monitored by way of press tracking and industry intelligence.  Residual realization  One of the main tenants of our investment strategy is to write original term contracts for a period less than the economic useful life of the equipment or other asset. The result of this approach leads to a high probability that the equipment or other asset will stay in place at the end of the initial term. The equipment or other asset is said to have high in-place value. As part of the same strategy, when possible, we set original terms against other factors of the end-users business. For example, we would write a 36 month IT infrastructure lease for equipment that has a 48 month software contract attached, thereby assuring a high probability that we will receive a minimum one year lease extension. Another example, we may write a 48 month contract to finance furniture and fixtures 52 Table of Contents against an underlying landlord/tenant lease of our end-user of 60 months. Some of the ways that we realize residual value are: - Automatic billing extension  Our lease documentation will require the lessee to provide notice before the lease matures in order to arrange for disposition of the equipment or other asset. If the lessee does not provide this notice, then they will automatically be billed for continued use until proper notice is delivered. - Re-leasing to lessee  We anticipate that a significant amount of our equipment and other assets will be re-leased to the current lessee at the end of the initial lease term. - Sold in place to lessee  We anticipate that we will sell the majority of our equipment and other assets in place to the original lessee at the end of its lease, re-lease or automatic billing extension period. - Resale market  On a limited basis, we may sell equipment and other assets that are not sold in place to the lessee at the end of its lease, re-lease or automatic billing extension period either to the original vendor or to a variety of used equipment dealers or other end-users. We believe successful realization of residuals at the end of a lease term depends on an accurate residual value assessment at the beginning of a lease. Our Investment Manager, as servicer of our leases, will make residual value assessments on our behalf using information from a number of sources, including: - secondary market publications; - interviews with manufacturers and used equipment dealers; - auction sales guides; - historical sales data; - industry organizations; - valuation companies; - ongoing communications with the end-users; and - the prior experience of our Investment Managers management as to propensity to re-lease or be sold in place. Based on its analysis of this information, our Investment Manager will establish a residual value for the end of each term for each type of equipment or other asset. However, as to any particular piece of equipment or other asset, our Investment Manager may not be able to re-lease or sell the equipment or other asset on our behalf at the end of the original lease term at a rate or price that will provide us the residual value our Investment Manager estimated on that equipment or other asset. Our Investment Managers collections policy is designed to identify payment problems early enough to permit it to address delinquencies in our leases quickly and, when necessary, to act on our behalf to preserve our interest in the equipment or other assets.  Lease provisions. The terms and provisions of each lease will vary depending on a number of factors, including: - the type and intended use of the equipment or other assets; - the business, operations and financial condition of the lessee; - any regulatory considerations; and - the tax consequences and accounting treatment of the lease transaction. 53 Table of Contents Certain terms and provisions, however, generally will be included in all of our leases. For example, we anticipate that each lease will hold the lessee responsible for: - paying rent without deduction or offset of any kind; - bearing the risk of equipment or other asset loss and maintaining both casualty and liability insurance on the equipment or other asset; - paying sales, use or similar taxes relating to the lease or other use of the equipment or other asset; - paying all miscellaneous charges such as documentation fees, late charges, charges for returned checks and similar fees and costs; - indemnifying us against any liability resulting from any act or omission of the lessee or its agents related to the equipment or other asset; - maintaining the equipment or other asset in good working order and condition during the term of the lease; - notifying us and obtaining our approval for moving the equipment or other asset; and - requiring our prior written consent before assigning or subleasing the equipment or other asset. Similar provisions will be included in our other investment documentation. Our investments will usually have terms ranging from 36 to 60 months. We anticipate that the average term over our aggregate portfolio will range from 42 to 54 months. We also anticipate that most of our investments will not be cancelable during their initial terms. However, we may agree to allow cancellation of a lease if the lessee pays us sufficient compensation so that the cancellation will not prevent us from achieving our objectives. At the end of each lease term, the lessee may have the option to buy the equipment or other assets, or renew the lease, either at set prices or at prices tied to current fair market value.  Portfolio acquisition strategies. We may purchase portfolios of equipment and other assets subject to existing leases. We anticipate that the principal sources for these portfolios will be: - international banks and investment banks; - other leasing companies; - regional and national commercial banks; and - captive finance companies of large manufacturers. In evaluating a portfolio acquisition, we expect to consider the following factors: - the business objectives of the seller in selling the portfolio; - the amount of the equipment and other assets and the number of leases in the portfolio; - how the leases were originated, whether directly with the end-user or through vendors or brokers; - the portfolio characteristics, including geographic and lessee and/or borrower concentrations, equipment and other asset cost range, types of leases and the original and remaining terms of the leases; - the sellers credit decision process; - the sellers lease documentation and any material variations from industry practices; - the sellers servicing policies; and - the portfolios aging, performance and default history, including the default history of other portfolios sold by the seller. We also will consider other elements such as: - who the seller is and its overall industry reputation; 54 Table of Contents - the performance of other portfolios we may have acquired from the seller; - the effect of the acquisition on our own portfolio; and - credit enhancements available from the seller, such as guarantees or additional security. If we then decide to pursue the portfolio acquisition, our Investment Manager will do a credit analysis of the entire portfolio, or financial analysis or other appropriate procedures. The results of our Investment Managers analysis will be presented to our Investment Managers investment committee which will decide which portfolios, if any, we will make an offer to acquire and the terms of our offer. In acquiring portfolios of equipment or other assets subject to existing leases, we will seek portfolios that will be consistent with the types of credits, industries and equipment we will focus on in our direct equipment leasing and financing activities. However, because a portfolio is often sold only in its entirety, it is possible that a material portion of the equipment, other assets and the related leases in a portfolio offered to us will not conform to these criteria. We will consider a portfolio for acquisition only when: - at least two-thirds of the equipment leases, by book value, conform to our equipment type and market criteria; or - our Investment Managers investment committee believes that the lessees are creditworthy and that such acquisition is strategically beneficial to meet our investment objectives. Once we acquire a portfolio of equipment or other assets subject to existing leases, it will become part of our overall portfolio and subject to our Investment Managers normal administrative processes and procedures as the servicer of our leases.  Transaction approval policies. From time to time, our Investment Managers investment committee, will set and if necessary revise standards and procedures for the review and approval of our equipment and other asset acquisitions, leases, participation and residual sharing agreements and other investments. The investment committee will, among other things: - determine whether to approve transactions and portfolio purchases; - determine whether to approve transactions that vary from standard credit criteria and policies; - resolve conflicts, if any, that may arise in the allocation of investments between us and our General Partner or among us and other programs managed by our General Partner or its affiliates as described in the Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary Responsibilities  Our General Partner, Our Investment Manager and Their Affiliates Will Engage in Activities That Compete With Us section of this prospectus; and - advise our General Partner and our Investment Manager with respect to any other matters submitted to the investment committee of our Investment Manager for its evaluation, as determined in the discretion of our Investment Manager. The current members of the investment committee are Messrs. Roberts, Silkowski, Miroshnikov, Spring, and Shelmerdine. Messrs. Silkowski and Roberts will maintain ultimate investment discretion and will have to be in agreement on the funding of any transactions. Sales of Revenue Streams In connection with transactions that have an associated revenue stream, we may sell such revenue stream on a discounted, non-recourse basis if our Investment Manager believes a sale of such revenue stream would increase our return on the investment while decreasing our exposure to the underlying investment and increase the proceeds available for additional investments. 55 Table of Contents Management, Origination and Servicing Agreement After we receive our minimum offering proceeds and begin operations, we will enter into a Management, Origination and Servicing Agreement with our Investment Manager, and we may enter into agreements with other affiliates of our General Partner and our Investment Manager. Under these agreements, in order to facilitate our acquisition of equipment, other assets and leases, our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates may:  temporarily acquire equipment and other assets from third-parties on our behalf;  originate leases with third-parties on our behalf, including equipment and other assets directly leased to end-users and equipment and other assets already subject to leases;  negotiate and arrange portfolio acquisitions, participatory interests in assets or equipment;  negotiate and arrange vendor programs and residual sharing agreements; and  purchase existing portfolios of equipment leases. We expect to purchase equipment and other assets from affiliates of our Investment Manager which will regularly originate transactions and offer to sell all or part of such transactions to us either individually or as a portfolio depending upon, among other things, the appropriateness of the proposed investment for us (as determined by our Investment Manager, in its sole discretion) and the amount available for investment by us at such time. During the Operating Period, we will have a right of first refusal, subject to the existing rights of SQN I and SQN II (which will be in different stages in their respective investment cycles), on all transactions originated by our affiliates that meet our investment objectives. We will acquire the equipment or other assets at a price no greater than the cost to the affiliates of our Investment Manager, as adjusted for intervening operations, plus compensation permitted under our partnership agreement and described in this prospectus. In the event an affiliate of our Investment Manager proposes to sell an asset or portfolio of assets (or a participation interest therein or any other suitable investment) to us, it will do so under a structure that creates and maintains an alignment of interest between us and the affiliate. We further expect that our Investment Manager will service all of our equipment, other assets and other investments under the Management, Origination and Servicing Agreement, including but not limited to:  underwriting;  receivables management;  re-leasing or selling the equipment or other assets after the termination of a lease or other contract; and  marketing our services. The compensation to our Investment Manager, for providing these services will be from the fees and reimbursements described in the Management Compensation section of this prospectus. The form of Management, Origination and Servicing Agreement is included as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. See the Where You Can Find More Information section of this prospectus. We also may use independent third-parties to originate or service a portion of our equipment, other assets and other investments at competitive rates. Changes in Investment Objectives and Policies You and our other partners will have no right to vote on the establishment or implementation of our investment objectives and policies, all of which are the responsibility of our General Partner. However, our General Partner cannot make any material changes in our investment objectives and policies without the consent of partners owning a majority of the total outstanding units entitled to vote. Any material change proposed by our General Partner, or any non-material change made by our General Partner without the vote of a majority of units held by you and our other partners, will be subject to our General Partners duty to act in our best interests. In proposing a material change, our General Partner will consider whether the proposed 56 Table of Contents change will be beneficial to our ability to preserve, protect and return your capital or make regular distributions to you and our other partners. INCOME, LOSSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS Our taxable income, taxable loss and cash distributions will be allocated 99% to you and our other partners, as a group, and 1% to our General Partner until you and our other partners have received total Distributions equal to your and their capital contributions plus an 8% per annum, compounded annually, cumulative return on your and their capital contributions. After such time, all distributed Cash Available for Distribution and distributed Net Disposition Proceeds will be allocated 80% to you and our other partners as a group and 20% to our General Partner. Allocations of Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions Among Investors For any fiscal period, we will apportion net income, net loss and cash distributions allocable to you and our other investors, as a group, including our General Partner and its affiliates to the extent they purchase units, in the ratio that the number of units held by each investor, multiplied by the number of days during the period the investor owned the units, bears to the amount obtained by totaling the number of units outstanding on each day during that period. We will not make distributions in kind, that is, of our non-cash assets, except possibly on our liquidation, and then only to a liquidating trust. Timing of Distributions Generally, we intend to make cash distributions on a semi-annual basis during the Operating Period. Since cash distributions are subject to the availability of funds, any anticipated distributions may not be made. Reinvestments in Additional Equipment, Other Assets, Leases and Other Investments During the Operating Period We have the right to invest our Net Disposition Proceeds during the Operating Period. Before we can reinvest our Net Disposition Proceeds, however, we must, at a minimum, distribute to you and our other partners an amount which satisfies the following requirement:  the amount distributed must include an amount of net proceeds from sales and refinancing of our equipment and other asset investments, if any, sufficient for you and our other partners to pay your federal, state and local income taxes, if any, resulting from those sales, based on our assumption that you and our other investors are in a 30% tax bracket. Return of Unused Capital We will return to you and our other partners, without interest, any of your net subscription proceeds that we do not commit to investment within 24 months after the beginning of this offering or that are not required as reserves.  Net subscription proceeds means your original subscription amount minus the organization and Offering Expense Allowance and distribution expenses paid on the sale of your units to you. Subscription proceeds will be considered committed for investment, and need not be returned, to the extent we have written agreements in principle, commitment letters, letters of intent, option agreements or similar contracts for the use of your net subscription proceeds in our investments. However, we must complete our investments under those agreements within an additional period of 12 months or return the uninvested funds to you and our other partners, except that the additional period for investments under those agreements using funds from Ohio investors will only be three months. 57 Table of Contents Reserve Account and Sources of Funds for Distributions Our partnership agreement requires us to establish an initial cash reserve for general working capital purposes of 1.0% of our offering proceeds. Any cash reserves used need not be restored, but if they are restored they may be restored from our operating revenues. We may distribute to you and our other partners any cash reserves that our General Partner determines are no longer required for our operations. However, our General Partner intends to make distributions primarily out of our:  cash from operations; and  cash from sales or refinancings. We will not borrow for the purpose of making distributions. 58 Table of Contents MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of our units for an individual investor who is a U.S. citizen or resident. It is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the U.S. Treasury regulations (Treasury Regulations) promulgated thereunder, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), judicial decisions and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change or different interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). This summary does not purport to deal with all of the federal income tax consequences applicable to the Fund or to all categories of investors, some of whom may be subject to special rules (including, without limitation, dealers in securities or currencies, holders of units held as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction with other investments, U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons who have elected mark to market accounting, persons who have not acquired their units upon their original issuance, persons who hold their unit through a partnership or other entity which is a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes, or persons for whom an unit is not a capital asset). The tax treatment for other investors, such as trusts, corporations, tax-exempt organizations and employee benefit plans, and foreign investors, are likely to differ significantly from the principal tax consequences outlined in this section. See  Tax Treatment of Certain Trusts and Estates,  Taxation of Tax-Exempt Organizations and  Corporate Investors. State and local tax consequences may differ from the federal income tax consequences described below. See  State and Local Taxation. The tax consequences of an investment in the Fund will depend not only on the nature of our operations and the then applicable federal tax principles, but also on certain factual determinations that cannot be made at this time, and upon a particular Limited Partners individual circumstances. No advance rulings have been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this prospectus. Each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our units. Opinion of Counsel Troutman Sanders LLP has acted as our counsel in this offering. In that capacity, we have received a tax opinion from Troutman Sanders LLP to the effect that, under the existing provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial decisions related thereto, we will be treated as a partnership, and not an association taxable as a corporation, for federal income tax purposes. No ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will concur with the foregoing opinion. Counsels opinion is based upon the facts described in this prospectus and upon additional facts that we provided to counsel about our operations and, among other things, our representations that: (1) our business will be conducted as described in this prospectus and (2) we will not elect to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation. Any alteration of our activities from the description we provided counsel may render the opinion unreliable. Furthermore, the opinion of counsel is based upon existing law, which is subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The discussion below assumes that we will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes Troutman Sanders LLP will not prepare or review our income tax information returns, which will be prepared by or on behalf of our General Partner and our independent registered public accounting firm. Our General Partner will make a number of decisions on such tax matters as the expensing or capitalizing of particular items, the proper period over which capital costs may be depreciated or amortized and many similar matters. Such matters are usually handled by a limited partnerships general partner, often with the advice of independent accountants, and are usually not reviewed with counsel. With regard to the tax consequences to you of an investment in our units, your use of our counsels tax opinion letter is subject to the limitations of the Code and proposed Treasury Regulations set forth below. With respect to any material federal tax issue on which our counsel has issued a more likely than not or more favorable opinion, its opinion may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties relating to any substantial understatement of income tax under Section 6662(d) of the Code. 59 Table of Contents Because we have entered into a compensation arrangement with Troutman Sanders LLP to provide certain legal services to us, including its tax opinion letter, such tax opinion letter was not written and cannot be used by you for the purpose of avoiding penalties relating to any reportable transaction understatement of income tax under Section 6662A of the Code. The limitations set forth above on your use of our counsels tax opinion letter apply only for federal tax purposes. They do not apply to your right to rely on our counsels tax opinion letter and the discussion in the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences section of this prospectus under the federal securities laws. Taxation of Limited Partnerships in General Multi-owner business organizations generally are treated either as corporations or partnerships for tax purposes. For income tax purposes, an unincorporated entity that is not subject to a specific classification provision and that does not elect to be taxed as a corporation is treated as a partnership and, thus, a pass through entity, which is generally a tax reporting entity and not a taxpaying entity. This means that the individual owners, i.e., the partners, and not the entity, i.e., the limited partnership, pay tax on the entitys income and deduct the entitys losses. As a limited partner, you will report your share of our income, deductions, capital gains and losses on your federal income tax return. You also will pay taxes on your share of any taxable income or gains earned by us. One tax advantage of being taxed as a partnership is that the federal government taxes our earnings only once. The limited partnership files an informational return with the IRS, but has no federal income tax liability. Because it pays no federal income taxes, the limited partnership has more cash to distribute to its investors. By contrast, the federal government effectively taxes a corporations earnings twice. The corporation itself must pay taxes on its taxable income, reducing the amount available to distribute in dividends to its shareholders and the shareholders are then required to pay income taxes on the dividends they receive. Another tax advantage of partnerships is that, subject to the limitations discussed in this section, investors often can deduct their share of any losses the limited partnership incurs, whereas a corporation does not pass through deductible losses to its investors. We believe that your most substantial tax risk from this investment would be for the IRS to treat us as a corporation for tax purposes, by classifying us as a publicly traded partnership, under Code Section 7704(b). Were that to happen, we would have to pay tax on our income, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to you; and you would not be able to deduct your share of any of our losses. Such a classification would adversely affect your after-tax return, especially if the classification were to occur retroactively. Furthermore, a change in our tax status would be treated as an exchange by the IRS, which could give rise to additional tax liabilities. See  Publicly Traded Partnerships. Your ability to deduct our losses is limited to the amounts that you have at risk in this investment. This is generally the amount of your investment, plus any profit allocations and minus any loss allocations and distributions. Additionally, your ability to deduct losses attributable to passive activities is restricted. Because our operations predominantly will constitute passive activities to an individual investor, you may only use our losses to offset passive income in calculating your tax liability. For example, passive losses may not be used to offset portfolio income, including interest income from our lending activities. See  Deductibility of Losses; Passive Activity Losses, Tax Basis and At-Risk Limitation. Leasing activities will generate a significant portion of our income. We expect that, for federal income tax purposes, our operating and leveraged leases will be treated as true leases and we will be considered the owner and lessor of the asset. The IRS may challenge the leases, however, and instead assert that they are sales or financings. This would result in the loss of your share of our cost recovery or depreciation deductions. See  Tax Treatment of Leases. We also plan to generate income by loaning money to acquirers of assets. We may be in the trade or business of making loans due to the manner in which we conduct our lending activities. However, our lending activities may not rise to the level of being in a trade or business, or the IRS could assert that was the case 60 Table of Contents even if we believed that our lending activities did constitute a trade or business of making loans. Finally, we may generate our remaining income through the buying and selling of financial instruments. This type of activity is governed by many specific tax rules. See  Tax Treatment of Lending Activities. Publicly Traded Partnerships The Code classifies some partnerships as publicly traded partnerships for tax purposes (PTPs). If we are classified as a PTP, we will be taxed as a corporation, the treatment of which is described above. A PTP is a partnership in which interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on either a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market. The Code contains an exception, however, from being taxed as a corporation if the PTP derives 90% or more of its gross income from sources such as interest and dividends, rents from real property and gains from the sale of real property. Because of our leasing activities, we do not expect to qualify for this exception. The legislative history of Code Section 7704 provides that a secondary market for interests in a partnership or the substantial equivalent thereof exists if investors are readily able to buy, sell or exchange their partnership interests in a manner that is comparable, economically, to trading on established securities markets. A secondary market is generally indicated by the existence of a person standing ready to make a market in the interests. The substantial equivalent of a secondary market will be deemed to exist if (i) interests in the partnership are regularly quoted by any person, such as a broker or dealer, making a market in the interests; (ii) any person regularly makes available to the public (including customers and subscribers) bid or offer quotes with respect to interests in the partnership and stands ready to effect buy or sell transactions at the quoted prices for itself or on behalf of others; (iii) if the holders of interests in the partnership have a readily available, regular and ongoing opportunity to sell or exchange their interests through a public means of obtaining or providing information of offers to buy, sell, or exchange interests; or (iv) buyers and sellers have the opportunity to buy, sell, or exchange interests in the partnership in a time frame that a market-maker would provide and prospective buyers have similar opportunities to acquire such interests. The legislative history of Code Section 7704 also indicates that a regular plan of redemptions or repurchases by a partnership may constitute public trading where holders of interests have readily available, regular and ongoing opportunities to dispose of their interests. We do not intend to list our units on any market. Our units also will not be readily tradable on a secondary market, nor do we expect them to be in the future. Therefore, we will be a PTP only if our units become readily tradable on the substantial equivalent of a secondary market. Our units will not become readily tradable merely because we provide information to our partners regarding other partners desires to buy or sell units to each other, or occasionally arrange transfers between partners. Moreover, our units will not become readily tradable if we create a qualified matching program, because transfers made through a qualified matching service are also not counted. A matching service qualifies for this exclusion if it satisfies all seven of the following conditions: (1) it consists of a system that lists customers bid and ask quotes in order to match sellers and buyers; (2) deals occur either by matching the list of interested buyers to interested sellers or by bidding on listed interests; (3) sellers cannot enter into a binding agreement to sell their interest until at least 15 days after information regarding their offering is made available to potential buyers; (4) the closing of the sale does not occur until at least 45 days after information about the offering is made available; (5) the matching service only displays quotes that express interest in trading but do not represent firm commitments to buy or sell at the quoted price; 61 Table of Contents (6) the sellers information is removed from the matching service within 120 days after the posting and, if removed for any reason other than a sale, no offer to sell from that seller is entered into the matching service for at least 60 days; and (7) the percentage of interests in the capital or profits transferred during the tax year (other than through private transfers) does not exceed 10% of the total interests in partnership capital or profits. The IRS should not treat us as a PTP. This conclusion is based in part on our representation to counsel that our units will not be listed on any securities exchange and that, in accordance with Section 13.2 of our Partnership Agreement, our General Partner will refuse to recognize or give effect to any assignment of our units for any purpose (including recognizing any right of the transferee, such as the right of the transferee to receive directly or indirectly our distributions or to acquire an interest in our capital or profits) that it knows or has reason to know occurred on an established securities market or a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and published notices promulgated thereunder, or to permit, recognize or give effect to any assignment of units that would result in the transfer of more than 2% of our units in any year other than those that our General Partner determines in good faith fall within certain safe harbor provisions under Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1. See Transfer of Our Units/Withdrawal  Restrictions on the Transfer of Our Units and Withdrawal. This is pursuant to a safe harbor under Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1 that provides that a secondary market or its equivalent will not exist if the sum of the interests in partnership capital or profits attributable to those partnership interests that are sold, redeemed, or otherwise disposed of during the partnerships taxable year and do not fall within other safe harbor provisions does not exceed 2% of the total interests in partnership capital or profits. In determining whether we satisfy the 2% safe harbor, redemptions of our units pursuant to Section 13.5 of our partnership agreement will be counted. While we will use our best efforts to limit the type and number of transfers of units to those that will allow us to remain within the 2% safe harbor, we do not warrant that we will satisfy this safe harbor during each of our taxable years. It is conceivable that transfers of units could occur that would cause us to fall outside the safe harbor. In this regard, Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(c)(3) states that failure to meet any of the safe harbors will not create a presumption that a secondary market or its equivalent exists for units. No assurances can be offered, however, that, if the amount and type of trading in our units were to fall outside the safe harbor, the IRS would not assert PTP status with respect to us. If we are classified as a PTP, we would be treated for federal income tax purposes as a corporation unless, as noted above, 90% or more of our income were to come from certain qualified sources. A significant portion of our business will be the leasing of personal (but not real) property, and income from this source is not qualified. Thus, if we were a PTP, we would be taxed as a corporation. As described above, the major consequences of corporate tax treatment would be that, in addition to being taxed when distributed to you, our income would be subject to corporate income tax and our losses would not be passed through to you. If we are taxed as a corporation, and particularly if the PTP classification is made retroactively, corporate taxation would have a substantial adverse effect on your after-tax return on your investment. Furthermore, the IRS would treat a change in tax status from a partnership to a PTP taxable as a corporation as an exchange that would give rise to tax liabilities for our limited partners if our debt exceeded the tax basis of our assets at the time of the change in tax status  even though limited partners likely would not receive cash distributions from us to cover such tax liabilities. See  Classification as a Partnership and  Sale or Other Disposition of Units. In addition, our distributions would be classified as portfolio income (dividends) rather than passive activity income, and thus, would not be eligible to be offset by passive activity losses attributable to us or other activities giving rise to passive activity losses. See  Deductibility of Losses; Passive Activity Losses, Tax Basis and At-Risk Limitation. Taxation of Current Distributions As long as we are classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we will not be subject to federal income tax. Rather, you will be required to report on your federal income tax return, and pay taxes with respect to, your share of our annual income, gains, losses, deductions and credits. You must pay tax on 62 Table of Contents your distributive share of our income regardless of the amount of distributions you receive. See  Our Income Versus Our Distributions. Our tax returns (information returns) will be prepared using the accrual method of accounting. Under the accrual method, we will recognize as income items such as rentals and interest as and when earned by us, even if the proceeds are not received until a subsequent tax year. We will furnish you with all information about us necessary to prepare your federal income tax return not later than 75 days after the end of each fiscal year. We also will file an annual information return with the IRS and will report our finances on an accrual basis using a December 31 fiscal year. Our income and loss for the taxable year will be allocated among our partners to take into account the varying interests of our partners during the year using any method permissible under Code Section 706 that our General Partner may select. If any partners hold their units for less than the entire year, they will be allocated income and loss using such method as selected by our General Partner that reflects such part-year ownership as is permissible under Code Section 706. For purposes of allocating income or loss among our partners, we will treat our operations as occurring ratably over each fiscal year  in other words, we will assume that income and loss are spread evenly over the fiscal year. Thus, if some limited partners are admitted after others, those limited partners admitted later may receive a smaller portion of each item of our net profits and net losses than the limited partners who were admitted earlier. Nevertheless, those limited partners still will be obligated to make the same capital contributions to us for their interests as the limited partners who were admitted previously. In addition, where a limited partner transfers units during a taxable year, a limited partner may be allocated net profits for a period for which such limited partner will not receive a corresponding cash distribution. Moreover, depreciation or other cost recovery with respect to our assets may create a deferral of tax liability during your ownership of our units. Larger cost recovery deductions in the early years may reduce or eliminate our taxable income in the initial years of our operations. This deferral, however, will be offset in later years, when smaller depreciation and cost recovery deductions will offset less of our income, while an increasing portion of our revenue must be applied to reduce debt principal. In later years, it is possible that taxable income will exceed cash distributions. With the exception noted below, you will not be required to pay income tax on cash distributions that exceed your share of our taxable income; however, the excess will reduce your tax basis for your units. Your tax basis also will increase or decrease annually based on your allocable share of our income or loss for the year. Any cash distributions you receive that exceed your tax basis (after adjustment for your allocated share of our income or loss) will be taxable to you, generally as capital gains, provided the units are held by you as capital assets. Any reduction in your share of non-recourse liabilities, such as might arise as a result of a reduction of your percentage interest in us upon issuance of additional units to new or existing partners, will be treated as a distribution of cash to you. A portion of any distribution in excess of your tax basis, however, will be recharacterized as ordinary income in the same percentage that ordinary income would be realized upon a sale by us of all our assets, for example, because of depreciation recapture. In addition, to the extent that a distribution would cause the amount you are considered to have at risk with respect to assets placed in service in a given year to become negative, you will have to include such amount in your gross income up to the amount of losses previously taken with respect to such assets. Further, a non-pro rata distribution of money or property, such as might arise as a result of a reduction of your share of our liabilities upon the admission of additional partners, may result in ordinary income to you, regardless of your tax basis in your units, if the distribution reduces your share of our unrealized receivables, including depreciation recapture, or substantially appreciated inventory items. These terms are defined in Section 751 of the Code, and are known as Section 751 assets. To that extent, you will be treated as having been distributed your proportionate share of our Section 751 assets and having exchanged those assets with us in return for the non-pro rata portion of the actual distribution made to you. This last deemed exchange generally will result in your realization of ordinary income under Section 751(b) of the Code. That ordinary income will equal the excess of (i) the non-pro rata portion of that distribution over (ii) your tax basis for your share of Section 751 assets deemed relinquished in the exchange. Similarly, upon our redemption of your units, it is possible that you could recognize both ordinary income and a capital loss. 63 Table of Contents Each limited partner is responsible for keeping its own records for determining such limited partners tax basis in its units and calculating and reporting any gain or loss resulting from a Fund distribution or disposition of a unit. Our Income Versus Our Distributions The taxable income we report to you each year will not equal the cash distributions that you receive during that year. The difference between reported income and cash distributions arises primarily from six facts: (i) depreciation and other cost recovery deductions reduce our taxable income, but not our cash available for distribution; (ii) our revenues or gain on sale that we reinvest or use to repay debt principal will generally constitute income even though using revenues for those purposes reduces the cash distributed to you. See  Cost Recovery; (iii) we will determine our income using the accrual method of accounting, which includes rental income as it accrues, even if not yet received; (iv) our financial assets may be subject to specific tax rules governing the timing of any inclusions of income and loss irrespective of any cash generated by our assets; (v) certain rules, such as the at-risk rules and the tax-exempt leasing rules, may prevent losses attributable to some of our investments in assets from being used to offset income attributable to our other investments in assets, with the result that our taxable income (and your share thereof) may be greater than our overall income (and your share thereof). Moreover, allowable at-risk losses may not offset our income from our lending activities under the passive loss rules; and (vi) we may need to disproportionately allocate our income on a per unit basis to equalize the limited partners capital accounts (as adjusted by certain items) on a per unit basis. Therefore, the cash distributions that we make to you may be greater or less than your share of our taxable income in any given year. Allocations of Profits and Losses Your share of any item of our income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is determined by our partnership agreement. As a general rule, we will allocate 99% of our profits among our limited partners (including our General Partner to the extent it owns units), and 1% to our General Partner. This allocation will continue until the excess of the cumulative profits allocated to our limited partners, in the aggregate, over the cumulative losses allocated to our limited partners, in the aggregate (not taking into account certain items that are specially allocated, such as non-recourse deductions and minimum gain chargebacks) would, if distributed currently to the extent not previously distributed, provide our limited partners in the aggregate with an 8% cumulative annual return, compounded annually. Thereafter our profits will be allocated 80% among our limited partners (including our General Partner to the extent it owns units) and 20% to our General Partner. As a general rule, 1% of our losses will be allocated to our General Partner and 99% will be allocated among our limited partners (including our General Partner to the extent it owns units). However, losses will be allocated 20% to our General Partner and 80% to our limited partners to reverse profits that were allocated in such 20%/80% ratio, described above. Non-recourse deductions (deductions generally attributable to our debt financed property) will be allocated 1% to our General Partner and 99% among our limited partners (including our General Partner to the extent it owns units ). The IRS respects a partnerships allocation of income, gain, loss, deductions or credits if: (a) the allocation has economic effect and is substantial, or (b) the partners can show that the allocation accords with each partners respective interest in us, and (c) in the case of either (a) or (b), the allocation complies with special rules requiring that partners receiving allocations of losses or deductions generated by purchasing assets with borrowed money be charged back income and gain as those funds are repaid. 64 Table of Contents Treasury Regulations generally provide that, for an allocation to have economic effect, the following conditions must be true:  the allocation must be reflected by an increase or decrease in the relevant partners capital account, as those accounts are maintained under the applicable Treasury Regulations;  liquidation proceeds must be distributed in accordance with the partners positive capital account balances; and  the partnership agreement must provide that if a partner will have a deficit balance in his or her capital account upon liquidation of the partnership, the partner must be required to restore the deficit amount to the partnership, so that amount may be distributed to other partners with positive capital account balances. However, the Treasury Regulations provide that in the absence of an obligation to restore the deficit, the partnership agreement must contain a qualified income offset provision. A qualified income offset provision mandates that when a partner receives a distribution from the partnership that causes a deficit in the partners capital account or increases a preexisting deficit, that partner must be allocated income and gains as quickly as possible to eliminate any deficit balance in his or her capital account that is greater than any amount that he or she is obligated to restore. The economic effect of an allocation is substantial if there is a reasonable possibility that it will substantially affect the amount to be received by our partners from us, independent of tax consequences. In addition, an economic effect is not substantial if, at the time the allocation becomes part of our partnership agreement: (1) at least one partners after-tax return may, in present value terms, be enhanced compared to his or her return if the allocation were not contained in our partnership agreement; and (2) there is a strong likelihood that no partners after-tax return will, in present value terms, be substantially diminished compared to his or her return if the allocation were not contained in our partnership agreement. The Treasury Regulations on this issue state that, in determining after-tax return, a partners entire tax situation, including aspects unrelated to the partnership, will be taken into account. Our partnership agreement contains several provisions designed to ensure that allocations have a substantial economic effect, including. (1) It requires that all allocations of income, gains, losses, deductions and distributions are reflected by an increase or decrease in the relevant partners capital accounts. (2) All partners who are allocated losses and deductions generated by assets acquired with borrowed money will be charged back income and gains generated by those assets. (3) Although no partner (other than our General Partners limited commitment) having a deficit balance in his or her capital account after the final liquidating distribution will be required to make a cash contribution to us to eliminate the deficit, our partnership agreement contains a provision for a qualified income offset and requires that, upon liquidation, our assets generally will be distributed to our partners first to the extent of any unreturned capital contributions and thereafter in the same manner as current distributions (which should correspond with such partners positive capital accounts.) Based on the foregoing, the allocations provided in our partnership agreement should be respected for tax purposes. However, depending on when a limited partner acquired a unit and for what price, it is possible that the allocations set forth in our partnership agreement have the effect of providing deferral for that partner. If, for example, the partner obtaining deferral is an individual in the highest tax bracket while the partner currently allocated income is tax-exempt, the allocations in our partnership agreement could be insubstantial. Nevertheless, because of the large number of expected partners, we do not believe there is a strong likelihood of this occurring. If upon audit the IRS were to take the position that any of our allocations of profits and losses should not be recognized, and if the IRSs position were sustained by the courts, you could be taxed on a portion of the income allocated to our General Partner or to another limited partner, and part of the deductions allocated to you could be disallowed. 65 Table of Contents Estimated Tax Payments You may be required to make estimated tax payments due to your liability for paying the taxes on your distributive share of our taxable income. See  Taxation of Limited Partnerships in General. We do not anticipate withholding or making payments to any taxing authority on behalf of our partners. Nevertheless, there may be some circumstances under which we are required to withhold on behalf of a partner. For example, under certain circumstances we are required to withhold a foreign partners share of our income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. If we do withhold or make a payment to a governmental authority on your behalf, we will treat any excess of that amount over your next entitled distribution as a demand loan carrying an interest rate of 12% per year. For further information regarding the tax consequences of our right or obligation to withhold or make a payment on your behalf, please consult your tax advisor. Retroactive Allocations Under Code Section 706(d), retroactive allocations  i.e., allocations of items to partners before they become partners  are prohibited, and Code Section 706(d) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder effect this prohibition by providing that if there is a change of a partners interest in a partnership in any taxable year, each partners distributive share of partnership tax items is to be determined by any method prescribed in the Treasury Regulations that takes into account the varying interests of the partners in the partnership during that year. Our partnership agreement provides that our items will, to the extent necessary in order to comply with Code Section 706(d), be allocated on a daily, monthly or other basis as determined by our General Partner using any permissible method under Code Section 706(d) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. If, as a result, an amount of profit or loss allocated to a partner is limited compared to what would otherwise have been the case with respect to the general rules regarding the allocation of profits and losses, such excess will be allocated to the other partners in relation to the amounts otherwise allocated to them. As a result, if some limited partners are admitted after others, they may receive a smaller portion of our profits and losses even though they are required to contribute the same amount as those limited partners who were admitted earlier. As stated above, some of this disparity results from a timing issue that will resolve itself over the life of the fund due to our allocation provisions beginning in our first fiscal year. However, a portion of this disparity may result from the receipt of additional cash distributions by those partners who invested earlier. Deductibility of Losses; Passive Activity Losses, Tax Basis and At-Risk Limitation Passive Activity Losses. The passive activity loss rules generally allow taxpayers to deduct their passive activity losses only against their passive activity income. Passive activity income does not include portfolio income like interest, dividends and royalties, or ordinary income from salary and other types of compensation for personal services. Therefore, taxpayers generally will be required to segregate income and loss into three categories: active trade or business income or loss; passive activity income or loss; and portfolio income or loss. The passive activity rules apply to individuals, estates, trusts, personal service corporations and some closely held corporations (including S corporations). A passive activity is one that involves the conduct of a trade or business in which the taxpayer does not materially participate. The IRS generally considers rental activities passive, whether or not a taxpayer materially participates. Furthermore, the IRS generally considers the status of limited partners to be passive with respect to a limited partnerships activities. Accordingly, we expect that you should treat your share of our rental income or loss as passive activity income or loss. We expect our lending activities to consist of the origination of loans to buy assets and secured by such assets and the buying and selling of existing loans secured by assets. In addition, regardless of whether we are in the trade or business of making secured financings, we expect that our interest income will not be considered from a passive activity and, therefore, may not be offset by any of your passive activity losses due to our expectation that our lending activity will be equity-financed (that is financed primarily with our equity capital rather than with funds we have borrowed). However, the treatment of gains and losses from our lending activities will depend on whether we are in the 66 Table of Contents trade or business of lending. If we are in the trade or business of lending, then our lending activities may generate passive activity gains or passive activity losses during the time you hold your units. Moreover, any interest you incur on debt used to acquire or maintain our units attributable to our leasing activities will be treated as a passive activity deduction. Regardless of whether we are in the trade or business of lending, the portion of any interest you incur on debt that is attributable to our lending activities will be attributable to our portfolio income (including our interest income from our lending activities), if any, and deduction of such amounts will be limited by the same principles as those applicable to losses passed through to you by us. We also will generate portfolio income or loss from our financial transactions, including interest on our funds pending their investment in assets. Finally, interest expense of a limited partner attributable to such portfolio income may be subject to other limitations on its deductibility. See  Interest Expense. You can deduct passive activity losses against passive activity income to reduce your overall income tax liability, but you cannot offset ordinary or portfolio income with passive activity losses. Accordingly, your tax deduction for passive activity losses will be limited by the amount of your passive activity income in any given tax year. If your share of our passive activity losses is greater than your passive activity income, you will have a suspended loss, meaning that you cannot deduct the loss in the year you incurred it. You can, however, carry the suspended loss forward indefinitely to offset any passive activity income you derive in future years, whether from us or another passive activity. Additionally, any suspended losses generally may be deducted against non-passive income when you recognize a gain or loss from the sale of your entire interest in us. Finally, passive activity income from us can be used to absorb losses from other passive activities, subject to special rules regarding PTPs. Losses from a PTP are treated as passive activity losses that may only be used to offset income subsequently generated by the same PTP that is taxed as a partnership. The IRS generally treats income from a PTP as portfolio income, unless it is used to offset previous losses from the same PTP. We have been structured to avoid being classified as a PTP; however, these rules mean that our income or losses may not be used to offset any losses or income you may derive from another limited liability company or partnership that is classified as a PTP. Tax Basis. Your initial tax basis in your units will be the price you paid for your units. Your tax basis will then be increased by your share of our income, by your share of our non-recourse indebtedness (that is, indebtedness for which none of the partners are personally liable) and any liabilities we have to you. Your basis will be reduced by the amount of any cash distributions you receive from us, your share of any of our losses, any reductions in your share of our non-recourse indebtedness, and any reduction in any liabilities we have to you. You may deduct your share of our losses, if any, only to the extent of the tax basis in your unit. Any losses allocated to you in excess of your tax basis in your unit are rolled over to your subsequent tax years until the earlier of (1) your ability to use the loss due to having sufficient tax basis in your unit or (2) the disposition of your unit. At-Risk Limitation. Generally, taxpayers may not deduct partnership losses they incur that exceed the total amount they have at risk in the partnership at the end of a partnerships tax year. For the most part, the amount a taxpayer has at risk equals the money and the adjusted basis of other property contributed to the partnership. At-risk is determined on an activity, and not an entity, basis. Thus, a single entity, like us, will have multiple at-risk activities, each of which will be subject to a separate at-risk limitation. You will not be at risk, and will not be entitled to increase the at-risk basis of your unit, with respect to our recourse liabilities, such as trade payables. Nor will you be at risk with respect to non-recourse liabilities incurred by us, such as amounts borrowed to finance asset purchases, even though our non-recourse liabilities (and, under certain circumstances, our recourse liabilities) may increase the tax basis of your unit. Thus, your initial amount at risk will be the amount of your investment, i.e., the price you paid for your units. A limited partners amount at risk will be reduced by (i) net losses that are allowed as a deduction to the limited partner under the at-risk rules and (ii) cash distributions received by a limited partner with respect to the limited partners units, and increased by that limited partners distributive share of our net profits. Investors should note that net losses that may be allowable as a deduction under the at-risk rules may be disallowed currently under the passive activity loss limitations. 67 Table of Contents If a limited partners at-risk amount is reduced below zero (due to a cash distribution to a limited partner), the limited partner must recognize income to the extent of the deficit at risk amount, up to the amount of loss the limited partner previously recognized that reduced his or her at-risk amount. Our losses that have been disallowed as a deduction in any year because of the at-risk rules will be allowable, subject to other limitations, as a deduction to the limited partner in subsequent years to the extent that the limited partners amount at-risk has been increased. It is not anticipated that, on an aggregate basis, we will incur losses. For purposes of the at risk rules, however, the Code will not allow us to aggregate our equipment leasing and lending businesses. Moreover, we can only aggregate our equipment leasing activities with respect to assets placed in service during the same taxable year. Therefore, the at risk rules will be applied separately to the net taxable income or loss resulting from leasing assets that were placed in service during separate taxable years. This could result in a limited partners deduction for losses with respect to certain items of assets being limited by the at risk rules, even though he or she must recognize income with respect to other assets. It also will require a limited partner to allocate his or her at-risk basis over the different activities described above, specifically, the different years assets and our lending activities. In such circumstances, the application of the at risk rules could compel a limited partner to recognize more taxable income in a year than that limited partners share of our aggregate income because of a limitation imposed by such rules on the ability to set off losses attributable to assets placed in service in one year against income attributable to assets placed in service in another year or against income from our lending activities. The sum of the amounts for which a limited partner will be considered at-risk for purposes of Section 465 of the Code, in any taxable year with respect to assets placed in service in that taxable year and in each prior year (treating all assets placed in service in the same year as a single activity separate from the activities represented by assets placed in service in other years) will be equal to (i) the capital contributions (as such term is defined in our partnership agreement) of such limited partner (provided that funds for such capital contributions are not from borrowed amounts other than amounts: (A) for which the limited partner is personally liable for repayment, or (B) for which property other than units are pledged as security for such borrowed amounts, but only to the extent of the fair market value of such pledged property and provided further that such capital contributions are invested in assets or otherwise expended in connection with our organization or leasing activities (or are subject to the rights of our creditors for amounts incurred by it with respect to same)), less (ii) the sum determined on a cumulative basis of (A) the total net losses with respect to such assets that have been allowed as deductions to the limited partner under the at risk rules and (B) cash distributions received by the limited partner with respect to the aforementioned assets, plus (iii) the limited partners distributive share, determined on a cumulative basis, of total net profits with respect to our assets. We expect that your at-risk basis will be less than your investment in us due to fees and the amount of your investment allocable to our lending activities. Deductions for Organizational and Offering Expenses; Start-Up Costs The costs of our organization and the sale of our units, as well as other start-up costs, generally may not be deducted in the year they are incurred; rather, they must be capitalized. Organizational expenses and start-up costs may be currently deducted on a limited basis (up to $5,000) in the year incurred. However, this $5,000 amount is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the cumulative cost of such expenditures exceeds $50,000. The remainder of the start-up costs can be amortized over a period of 180 months. Syndication expenses, which are the costs incurred to promote or effect the sale of our units are non-deductible, must reduce partners capital accounts when incurred and give rise to a tax offset, if at all, only upon our liquidation, and then, in most cases, only as a capital loss. Syndication expenses include brokerage fees (such as the distribution expenses provided for in our partnership agreement); registration and filing fees with the Securities and Exchange Commission and each State in which our units are sold; our legal fees for securities advice and advice concerning the adequacy of tax disclosures in the offering materials; accounting fees for the preparation of information to be included in the offering materials; printing and reproduction costs; and other selling or promotional expenses. 68 Table of Contents We will endeavor to treat our organizational, start-up and syndication costs in accordance with the foregoing rules. There is uncertainty, however, about the distinction between trade or business expenses that may be currently deducted, and organizational, start-up and syndication costs that must be capitalized or deferred. Because of this uncertainty, the IRS could challenge the current deduction of some of our expenses on the grounds that the expenses are not deductible in the year incurred. Under our partnership agreement, distribution expenses are specially allocated to those limited partners with respect to whose purchase of units such commissions and fees were paid. Other syndication expenses will be allocated, to the extent possible, in equal amounts per unit. If such equality is not possible, our General Partner may make compensating allocations of items of income or loss to achieve the same effect on capital accounts. Tax Treatment of Leases Your depreciation and cost recovery deductions with respect to any item of our leased assets depends, in part, on the tax classification of the agreement under which such asset is leased. These deductions are only available if the agreement is a true lease of an asset for income tax purposes, which means we retain ownership of the asset. Depreciation and cost recovery deductions are not available if the transaction is classified as a sale, or as a financing or refinancing arrangement where, for tax purposes, the nominal lessee is treated as the owner of the asset. Whether we are the owner of any particular asset, and whether a lease is a true lease for federal income tax purposes, depends upon both factual and legal considerations. The IRS has published guidelines on the tax treatment of leveraged leases. These guidelines do not purport to be substantive rules of law and are not supposed to be applied in audit contexts, although they have been in a number of instances. Whether any lease will meet the relevant requirements to be characterized as a true lease, and whether we will be treated for tax purposes as the owner of each asset acquired by us, will depend upon the specific facts in each case. Because these facts cannot now be determined with regard to leases that will be entered into in the future, our counsel cannot render an opinion on this issue. Cost Recovery Generally, a significant portion of the assets that we plan to acquire and lease generally will be as 3-year, 5-year or 7-year property and may be written off for federal income tax purposes, through cost recovery or depreciation deductions, over our respective recovery period. The amount deductible in each year generally may be calculated using the 200 percent declining-balance depreciation method, switching to the straight-line method at a time that maximizes the deduction. A taxpayer may, however, choose to use a straight-line method of depreciation for the entire recovery period. In some circumstances, a taxpayer will be required to recover the cost of an asset over a longer period of time than described above. These circumstances include the use of assets predominantly outside the United States and the use of assets by a tax-exempt entity. See  Limitations on Cost Recovery Deductions. Limitations on Cost Recovery Deductions Property Used Predominantly Outside the United States. We may own and lease assets that are used predominantly outside the United States. The cost of these assets must be written off for federal income tax purposes using the straight-line method of depreciation over a period corresponding to the assets ADR Class Life, which generally is longer than the 3-year, 5-year or 7-year periods permitted for other property. If the asset does not have an ADR Class Life, a 12-year period must be used. Certain types of property used predominantly outside the United States nevertheless qualify for the normal rules discussed above, that is, a shorter depreciable life should be allowable. The exceptions include the following: (1) aircraft registered in the United States that are operated to and from the United States; (2) some railroad rolling stock used within and without the United States; 69 Table of Contents (3) vessels documented under the laws of the United States that are operated in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States; and (4) containers owned by a United States taxpayer that are used in the transportation of property to and from the United States. Tax-Exempt Leasing. We may lease assets to tax-exempt entities. Property leased to tax-exempt entities, called tax-exempt use property, must be written off for federal income tax purposes using the straight-line method of depreciation. The depreciation period is the longer of  the assets ADR Class Life, which generally is longer than the 3-year, 5-year or 7-year periods permitted for property not leased to tax-exempt entities; or  125% of the term of the lease, including all options to renew as well as some successor leases for the asset. The definition of a tax-exempt entity includes governmental bodies and tax-exempt governmental instrumentalities, tax-exempt organizations, some foreign persons and entities and some international organizations. The term also generally includes organizations that were tax-exempt at any time during the five-year period before the organization first uses the property involved. Foreign persons or entities are treated as tax-exempt entities with respect to property if less than 50% of the income derived from the leased property is subject to U.S. income tax. The term tax-exempt use property does not include: (1) property that is used predominantly by a tax-exempt entity in an unrelated trade or business, if the entity pays unrelated business income tax on the income from the trade or business; (2) property leased to a tax-exempt entity under a short-term lease, meaning a lease that has a term of either less than one year, or less than 30% of the propertys ADR Class Life as long as that is less than three years; and (3) certain high-technology equipment. In addition, under Code Section 470, enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the 2004 Tax Act), losses attributable to the leasing of tax-exempt use property (including property described in items (2) and (3) of the immediately preceding paragraph) cannot be deducted currently, but must be deferred until there is income derived from such property or when the interest therein is completely disposed of, unless the lease complies with certain requirements. Because these facts depend upon leases that will be acquired or entered into in the future, no conclusion can be expressed now regarding the possible application of Code Section 470 to leases of property to tax-exempt entities. Consequences of Rules Regarding Depreciation of Assets Predominantly Used Outside the U.S. and Tax-Exempt Leasing. To the extent that our assets are subject to the depreciation rules regarding property used outside the United States or regarding tax-exempt use property, and to the extent that the loss suspension rules under Code Section 470 apply because we have losses attributable to tax-exempt use property, a partner will generally have to recognize taxable income and may have to pay income tax in greater amounts in the early stages of our existence than would otherwise have been the case, for at least two reasons. First, the longer depreciation periods for assets used predominantly outside the United States and tax-exempt use property means that the annual depreciation deduction for such property will be smaller than otherwise would have been the case, but continue longer, thereby increasing net income (or reducing net loss) with respect to such property, in the early years, but reducing net income (or increasing net loss) in the later years. Second, if losses are suspended pursuant to Code Section 470, taxable net income is greater (or net loss is less) during the period that such loss is suspended than otherwise would have been the case, but such taxable net income would be less (or net loss would be greater) in later years, when the property to which the loss is attributable either produces income or is disposed of and the loss can then be taken. 70 Table of Contents Deferred Payment Leases Section 467 of the Code requires both the lessor and lessee in certain lease agreements to annually accrue the rent and interest on any rental payments that will be paid in the future. A Section 467 rental agreement is any rental agreement for the use of tangible property that involves total payments in excess of $250,000 and either provides for increasing (or decreasing) rental payments, or provides that some rent for the use of property in a calendar year is payable after the close of the following calendar year. In general, the amount of rent that must be allocated to a tax year will be determined by the terms of the lease. In some circumstances, however, rent will be required to be allocated to a year prior to the year in which it will be paid, with the exact amount determined based upon present-value principles and, in the case of certain rental agreements, on a constant, level rate; the present-value amount would accrue interest until paid. We may enter into transactions that meet the definition of a Section 467 lease agreement, which could result in the acceleration of income recognition by us prior to receipt of the corresponding cash flow. Another consequence would be the conversion of some of our income from rental income (passive) to interest income (portfolio) due to the deemed time value of money rules. Sale or Other Disposition of Our Property Because of the different individual tax rates for capital gains and ordinary income, the tax code provides various rules classifying income as ordinary income or capital gains, and for distinguishing between long-term and short-term gains and losses. The distinction between ordinary income and capital gains is relevant for other purposes as well. For example, there are limits on the amount of capital losses that an individual may offset against ordinary income. Upon a sale or other disposition of our assets, we will realize gain or loss equal to the difference between the tax basis of the asset at the time of disposition and the price received for such asset upon disposition. Any foreclosure of a security interest in an asset will be considered a taxable disposition, and we will realize gain if the face amount of the debt being discharged were greater than the tax basis of the asset, even though we will not receive cash. Because our assets are tangible personal property, upon the disposition of such assets, all of the depreciation and cost recovery deductions taken by us will be subject to recapture to the extent of any realized gain. Recapture means that the depreciation previously deducted is reversed by recognizing the depreciated amounts as ordinary income in the year of the sale or other disposition. Recapture cannot be avoided by holding the assets for any specified period of time. If we were to sell assets on an installment basis, all depreciation recapture income would be recognized at the time of sale, even though the payments are received in later taxable years. Certain gains and losses are grouped together to determine their tax treatment. The gains on the sale or exchange of certain assets, including assets used in a trade or business such as that to be owned by us and held for more than one year, are added to the gains from some compulsory or involuntary conversions. If these gains exceed the losses from such sales, exchanges and conversions, the excess gains will be taxed as capital gains (subject to the general rules of depreciation recapture described above and a special recapture rule described below). If the losses exceed the gains, however, the excess losses will be treated as ordinary losses. Under a special recapture provision, any net gain under this aggregation rule will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain if the taxpayer has non-recaptured net losses, which are net losses under this aggregation rule from the five preceding taxable years that have not yet been offset against net gains in those years. Because of the nature of our property, we expect that substantially all, if not all, of any gain we realize on the sale or other disposition of our assets will be treated as ordinary income for income tax purposes rather than capital gain. 71 Table of Contents Tax Treatment of Lending Activities Until we have conducted operations for a while, we will not know whether our lending activities constitute a trade or business of originating, buying, and selling loans. It could be that we will not be in the business of originating, buying, and selling loans, especially if our loan originations are a small part of our lending activity. The Code contains many special rules regarding the proper recognition of income, gain, loss, deduction and credits. For example, there are specific rules concerning the tax treatment of hedging transactions, constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions, and original issue discount. Also, management fees incurred for investment activities are not considered trade or business expenses. Instead, they are considered investment expenses and their deductibility is limited. Thus, if our lending activity (or other activity in which we engage) is not a trade or business, a portion of the Management Fees and other costs incurred by you may be considered investment expenses, the deductibility of which is subject to various limitations. In addition, your tax treatment of any losses we incur on our loans may depend on whether we are in the trade or business of making loans. For example, if loans we acquire are not considered to have been acquired and held by us in connection with our trade or business of lending money, any loss we might incur if a borrower or borrowers defaulted on such loans would be a capital loss rather than an ordinary loss. With very limited exceptions, capital losses can be deducted only against capital gains and not against ordinary income. Because the proper tax treatment will depend on the specific terms and conditions of the loans we originate, buy, and sell, our counsel cannot render an opinion on this issue. Sale or Other Disposition of Units The gain or loss you realize on the sale of our units includes the cash or other consideration you receive from the purchaser, as well as your share of our non-recourse indebtedness. This gain or loss will, except as noted below, be taxed as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long you hold your units, assuming that your units qualify as capital assets in your hands. The portion of your gain attributable to ordinary income assets held by us, which includes inventory and unrealized receivables, would be treated as ordinary income. Ordinary income assets include assets that are subject to recapture of recovery or depreciation deductions, determined as if your proportionate share of our assets is sold at the time you sell your units. Ordinary income assets also include certain income from market discount bonds or short-term obligations that we may acquire at a discount. Thus, it is likely that most of any gain upon the sale of your units will be treated as ordinary income. You must promptly notify us of any transfer of your units, whether by sale, gift or otherwise. Once we are notified, we are required to inform the IRS, the buyer and you of the fair market value of the allocable share of unrealized receivables and appreciated inventory attributable to the units you sold or exchanged. This report must be made on or before January 31 following the calendar year of sale. There are penalties for failure to inform the IRS, and if you fail to notify us of the transfer of your units, you will be penalized $50 per failure. Treatment of Cash Distributions Upon Redemption or Repurchase The redemption or repurchase by us of all or a portion of your units will be treated as a sale or exchange of the units for income tax purposes and may generate taxable income or loss to you. The amount you realize in such redemption or repurchase will equal the sum of the cash you receive plus your share of our non-recourse liabilities. Simultaneously with your receipt of a cash distribution from us in connection with a redemption or repurchase, your share of our ordinary income assets will be reduced. You will be treated as if you have received the cash, or a portion of the cash, in exchange for your share of ordinary income assets. If the distribution that is deemed a payment for the ordinary income assets exceeds your share of the adjusted basis of the ordinary income assets, you must recognize the excess as ordinary income. The remainder of the distribution, if any, will be treated in the same manner as a distribution (that is, you will recognize income only to the extent that the cash distributions exceed your adjusted basis in your units). See  Taxation of 72 Table of Contents Current Distributions. Thus, our redemption of your units may cause you to realize ordinary income and a capital loss. Gifts of Units Generally, no gain or loss is recognized upon the gift of property. A gift of units, however, including a charitable contribution, may be treated partially as a sale, to the extent of your share of our non-recourse liabilities. You may be required to recognize gain in an amount equal to the difference between your share of non-recourse indebtedness and, in the case of a charitable contribution, the portion of the basis in the units allocable to that deemed sale transaction. In the event of a non-charitable gift, the amount of your share of the non-recourse indebtedness is offset by your entire basis in the units. Charitable contribution deductions for the fair market value of the units will be reduced by the amounts involved in such a partial sale and, in any event, may be subject to reduction in certain cases by the amount of gain that would be taxed as ordinary income on a sale of your units. Consequence of No Section 754 Election Because of the complexities of the tax accounting required, we do not presently intend to file an election under Section 754 of the tax code to adjust the basis of our assets in the case of transfers of units. As a consequence, a person who obtains units from another partner may be subject to tax upon the portion of the proceeds of sales of our assets that represents a return of capital to that person. This may adversely affect the price that potential purchasers would be willing to pay for our units. Even if we do not make a Section 754 election, however, the Code requires mandatory basis adjustments for transfers of interests in partnerships with substantial built-in loss (where the adjusted basis of our property exceeds the propertys market value by more than $250,000). In such instances, the adjusted tax basis of our assets will be reduced to their fair market value with respect to the transferee partner. Similarly, we will not make any adjustments upon redeeming a partner, unless required to under the Code. Tax Treatment of Our Termination Pursuant to Our Partnership Agreement When we terminate pursuant to our partnership agreement, we are required to dispose of our assets, apply the proceeds and other funds to repayment of our liabilities and generally distribute any remaining funds to our partners first to the extent of any unreturned capital contributions and thereafter in the same manner as current distributions. Provided that such termination does not occur very early during our existence, we expect that the distributions to our limited partners (including our General Partner to the extent it owns units) upon such termination will be proportionate based on the number of units owned by each limited partner as of the liquidation date because of the manner in which Profits and Losses are allocated among our limited partners during our early fiscal years. Sales and other dispositions of our assets would have the tax consequences described in  Sale or Other Disposition of Our Property. Cash distributions made at liquidation that exceed the tax basis of your interest in us generally would be taxable as capital gain, provided your units constitute capital assets in your hands. Cash distributions in amounts less than your basis may result in a loss, generally a capital loss, which would be subject to the general limitations on deductibility of capital losses. Audit by the IRS No tax rulings have been sought by us from the IRS. While we (and any joint ventures in which we participate) intend to claim only those deductions and assert only those tax positions for which there is at least substantial authority, the IRS may audit our returns or any joint venture we are involved in, and it may not agree with some or all of the tax positions our General Partner takes. An audit of our information return may result in an increase in our income, the disallowance of deductions, or the reallocation of income and deductions among our partners. In addition, an audit of our information return may lead to an audit of your personal income tax return, which could lead to adjustments of items unrelated to this investment. 73 Table of Contents You must report your share of our income, gains, losses, deductions and credits on your individual return in a manner consistent with our return, even if the Schedule K-1 we send to you reports the item differently unless you file a statement with the IRS identifying the inconsistency, or unless you can prove your return is in accordance with information provided by us. Failure to comply with this requirement will subject you to penalties and may result in an extended time period for the IRS to challenge your return. In most circumstances, the federal tax treatment of the income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of a partnership will be determined at the limited partnership level in a unified partnership proceeding, rather than in separate proceedings with its partners. In any audit of a partnership, the IRS will deal with the partnerships tax matters partner. Our General Partner is designated as our tax matters partner in our partnership agreement. Only limited partners having at least a 1% interest in us will be entitled to receive a separate notice from the IRS of any audit of our return and of the results of the audit. Limited partners who have an interest of less than 1% will not be entitled to notice from the IRS; however, groups of limited partners who together own a 5% or greater interest in us may, by notification to the IRS, become a notice group and designate a limited partner of their group to receive IRS notices. All limited partners have the right to participate in any audit of us. We are required to keep you informed of any administrative and judicial proceedings involving our tax matters. Also, we will keep you advised of any significant audit activities with respect to us. As the tax matters partner, our General Partner is authorized to enter into settlement agreements with the IRS that are binding upon limited partners with less than a 1% interest, except for those who belong to a notice group or who have filed a statement with the IRS that we do not have authority to enter into settlement agreements that are binding upon them. You are entitled to have any favorable settlement agreement reached between the IRS and another limited partner with respect to our item applied to you. Our tax matters partner also may extend the statute of limitations period with respect to our tax matters. Note that the statute of limitations for the IRS to adjust your partnership items is generally the longer of your personal statute of limitations or the partnerships statute of limitations. Our partnership agreement empowers our General Partner to conduct, on behalf of us and our limited partners, all examinations by tax authorities relating to us at our expense. See Summary of Our Partnership Agreement. A tax controversy could result in substantial legal and accounting expenses being charged to us, even if the outcome is favorable. Alternative Minimum Tax Some taxpayers must pay an alternative minimum tax (AMT) if the AMT exceeds the taxpayers regular federal income tax liability for the year. For non-corporate taxpayers, the AMT is imposed on alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) that is above an exemption amount. The AMTI is based on a different computation of taxable income, which is increased by tax preference items, and other adjustments to taxable income are made. The principal adjustment associated with an investment in our units relates to depreciation or cost recovery deductions. In this case depreciation deductions are limited to those that do not exceed those calculated using the 150% declining balance method. We do not anticipate that any significant tax preference items will be generated by us. You should be aware, however, that, for purposes of computing AMTI, interest you pay to acquire or maintain an ownership interest in a passive activity (such as our units) is deductible only to the extent that the interest payments, when added to your passive activity income or loss and computed with the appropriate alternative minimum tax adjustments and tax preferences, does not result in a passive activity loss. Accordingly, if you borrow money and incur interest expense in connection with your purchase of our units, you may only be allowed a limited deduction for that interest in calculating AMTI. Additionally, if our lending activity is characterized as an investment activity rather than as a trade or business, a portion of our Management Fees and other costs you incur could be considered investment expenses and not trade or business expenses. Investment expenses are not deductible for AMTI purposes. 74 Table of Contents The rules relating to the alternative minimum tax for corporations are different than those just described. Corporations contemplating purchase of our units should consult their tax advisors as to the possible AMT consequences of investing in our units. Interest Expense In general, interest paid in connection with investment activities is deductible only against investment income. Interest paid in connection with investments in passive activities, such as in an investment in our units, may only be deducted in accordance with the rules for losses derived from passive activities, except to the extent allocable to portfolio income. As stated above, our activities will include both passive activities and non-passive activities. Thus, any interest expense you incur may need to be bifurcated between our passive activities and our non-passive activities when determining its deductibility on your personal return. See  Deductibility of Losses; Passive Activity Losses, Tax Basis and At-Risk Limitation. Interest paid by us will be allocated among our leasing activities, reserves and lending activities according to IRS rules that (subject to certain presumptions) look to how we used the money we borrowed. To the extent allocated to the assets that we lease, such interest will likely be treated as passive activity interest. Interest allocable to our reserves or to loans we make will likely be treated as investment expense and deductible only to the extent of investment income. Interest on money you borrow in order to purchase a unit will have to be allocated among these same categories. However, because we will enter into net leases, the IRS might also argue that the portion of interest expense we incur or that is incurred by you on monies borrowed to purchase our units attributable to such leases might be investment interest expense and deductible only to the extent of investment income. We may enter into transactions involving the prepayment of interest or the payment of points, commitment fees and loan origination or brokerage fees. In general, prepaid interest, points and similar costs may not be deducted currently; they usually have to be capitalized and expensed over the life of the related loan. Self-Employment Tax Under Code Section 1402(a)(13), limited partners in limited partnerships are not subject to self-employment tax with respect to their distributive share of income or loss of a limited partnership other than with respect to guaranteed payments to a partner for services actually rendered to or on behalf of the partnership. Thus, an individual limited partners distributive share of our income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit is not included in the individuals net earnings from self-employment for purposes of calculating the self-employment tax. Limited Deductions for Activities Not Engaged in for Profit The ability to take deductions for activities not engaged in for profit is limited. The law presumes that an activity is engaged in for profit if the gross income from the activity exceeds the deductions from the activity in at least three out of five consecutive years, ending with the tax year at issue. We intend to operate for the purpose of providing an economic profit and anticipate that we will have sufficient income to entitle us to the benefit of the presumption that we operate for profit. If the IRS were to treat our activities as not being engaged in for profit, any deductions of ours in excess of our income might be permanently disallowed. Foreign-Source Taxable Income Rental income and interest received by us from sources in foreign countries could be subject to withholding and/or income taxes imposed by those countries. In addition, gains on the sale of our assets also may be subject to taxes in foreign countries where we sell assets. Tax treaties between some countries and the United States may reduce or eliminate such taxes. Our foreign activities, however, may require you to file tax returns in foreign countries. We cannot predict what tax rate our income will be subject to in other countries, since the amount and type of our investments in various countries is not known. We will inform you of your proportionate share of any foreign income and the foreign taxes, if any, paid by us. You will then be required to include these items on your tax return. At your option, you generally will 75 Table of Contents be entitled to claim either a credit (subject to the limitations discussed below) or, if you itemize your deductions, a deduction (subject to the limitations generally applicable to deductions) for your share of foreign taxes in computing your federal income taxes. Generally, a credit for foreign taxes may not exceed the federal tax liability attributable to your total foreign-source taxable income. Your share of our rental and interest income attributable to assets used outside the United States or loans made to foreign persons generally will qualify as foreign-source income, and the source of income from the sale of assets will usually be attributed to the location of the asset. Several limits apply to the foreign tax credit. The credit is applied separately to different types of foreign-source income, including foreign-source passive income like interest income, and special limits also apply to income from the sale of capital assets. Furthermore, in calculating the foreign tax credit limitation, the amount of your foreign-source income is reduced by various deductions that are allocated and/or apportioned to the foreign-source income. One such deduction is interest expense, a portion of which will generally reduce the foreign-source income of any limited partner who owns foreign assets, either directly or indirectly. For these purposes, foreign assets owned by us will be treated as owned by our limited partners, and indebtedness incurred by us will be treated as incurred by limited partners. Because of these limits, you may be unable to claim credit for the full amount of your proportionate share of the foreign taxes attributable to our income. In addition, any foreign losses generated by us could reduce the tax credits available to you from foreign-source income unrelated to us. The foregoing is only a general description of the foreign tax credit under current law. Since the availability of a credit or deduction depends on your particular circumstances, we advise you to consult your own tax advisor. Registration, Reportable Transactions, Interest and Penalties Tax Shelter Registration and Reportable Transactions. The Code imposes disclosure and list maintenance obligations for persons that participate in listed and reportable transactions. In general, listed and reportable transactions are those that the IRS views as having substantial potential for tax avoidance or evasion. By category, reportable transactions include listed transactions, confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, transactions that result in substantial losses, and transactions of interest. The Treasury Regulations define transaction as including all of the factual elements relevant to the expected tax treatment of any investment, entity, plan, or arrangement, and includes any series of steps carried out as part of a plan. Of the various reportable transaction categories that could apply to us, it is possible that the threshold of the gross out-of-pocket losses contemplated by the loss transaction reportable transaction category may be experienced by us or our partners (including the $2,000,000 in any one year, or $4,000,000 over any combination of years thresholds for a partnership that does not have only C corporations as partners). If an investment in our units or our investment in a specific asset or group of assets were considered to be a reportable transaction, then our partners would be required to adequately disclose such transactions on their income tax return and we would be required to disclose such transactions on our information return. We do not expect that, under current regulations, an investment in our units or our investments in assets will constitute reportable transactions, because it is expected that the requisite magnitude of losses, if any, will not be incurred, and the disclosure and list maintenance requirements for such transactions are therefore not applicable. It is possible, however, that we may lease a asset or group of assets that experience losses that meet the threshold or we may incur losses exceeding the threshold in a lending transaction subject to these rules. Nevertheless, because we have not yet made any investments, we do not know whether any of our transactions would be reportable transactions. Interest on Underpayments. The interest that taxpayers must pay for underpayment of federal taxes is the federal short-term rate plus three percentage points, compounded daily. The federal short-term rate is set quarterly by the Treasury Department based on the yield of U.S. obligations with maturities of three years or less. Penalty for Substantial Understatements or Understatements Attributable to Reportable Transactions. The tax code also contains a penalty for substantial understatement of federal income tax liability equal to 20% of the amount of the understatement; and a penalty on the understatement of tax attributable to a 76 Table of Contents reportable transaction equal to 20% of the understatement (30% if the transaction is not disclosed) whether or not the taxpayers total understatement is substantial. An understatement occurs if the correct tax for the year (as finally determined after all administrative and judicial proceedings) exceeds the tax liability actually shown on the taxpayers returns for the year. An understatement on an individuals return will be considered substantial for purposes of the penalty if it exceeds both (a) 10% of the correct tax and (b) $5,000. The imposition of this penalty may be avoided however if, in the case of any item that is not attributable to a reportable transaction, (a) there was substantial authority for the taxpayers treatment of the item, or (b) the relevant facts affecting the items tax treatment were adequately disclosed in the taxpayers return, provided that the taxpayer had a reasonable basis for the tax treatment of such item. In the case of an item that is attributable to a reportable transaction, the penalty may be avoided if (a) all the relevant facts affecting the tax treatment of the item are adequately disclosed on the foregoing return, (b) there was substantial authority for the taxpayers treatment of the item and (c) the taxpayer reasonably believed that his treatment of the item on the return was more likely than not the proper treatment. If any of our transactions constitute reportable transactions, you may receive from us a copy of Form 8886, which is used to disclose such transactions to the IRS. You should consult with your own tax advisor as to the reporting on your own tax returns of that form and the information that it contains. Failure of a limited partner to report such information may result in a penalty for that limited partner. State and Local Taxation In addition to the federal income tax consequences described above, you should consider potential State and local tax consequences of this investment. Your share of our taxable income or loss generally will be included in determining reportable income for State or local tax purposes in the jurisdiction where you reside. In addition, other states in which we own assets or do business may require you to file State income tax returns and may impose taxes on your pro rata share of our income derived from that State. Any tax losses generated by our operations in such States may not be available to offset income from other sources in other States. To the extent that you pay tax to a State by virtue of our operations within that State, you may be entitled to a deduction or credit against tax owed to your State of residence with respect to the same income. If you itemize deductions for federal income tax purposes, your payment of State and local taxes will constitute a deduction for federal income tax purposes. We advise you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the effect of State and local taxes, including gift and death taxes as well as income taxes, which may be payable in connection with this investment. Tax Treatment of Certain Trusts and Estates The tax treatment of trusts and estates can differ from the tax treatment of individuals. Investors who are trusts and estates should consult with their tax advisors regarding the applicability of the tax rules discussed in this section. Taxation of Tax-Exempt Organizations Charitable and other tax-exempt organizations, including qualified pension plans and individual retirement accounts, are subject to the unrelated business income tax. Under the Code, a charitable remainder trust that has unrelated business taxable income is subject to an excise tax equal to 100% of such income. Tax-exempt investors will be deemed to be engaged in the business carried on by us and will be subject to the unrelated business income tax. Income from our leasing activities will constitute UBTI. In addition, to the extent that we are considered to have financed our lending activities with borrowed funds, our income from such activities also will constitute UBTI. We do not expect to finance our lending activities with borrowed funds; however, the test linking a partnerships debt with an activity is broad and is subject to a facts and circumstances test. For example, the IRS has taken the position that a partnership that has invested all of its cash and then needs to finance its working capital has debt-financed income for purposes of the UBTI rules. Thus, even though we do not intend to borrow to finance our lending activities, future operations could give rise to an IRS challenge that we have generated debt-financed income. Further, to the extent that the IRS could successfully assert that a portion of the money we borrowed to finance our leasing activities should instead be attributed to our 77 Table of Contents lending activities, the portion of our income that constitutes UBTI would be increased. This is because rental income, such as the income we derive from the leasing of personal property, constitutes UBTI whether we finance it from our capital or from borrowings. However, interest income we derive from our lending activities constitutes UBTI only if we generate it using borrowed funds. Thus, our UBTI increases proportionately with the amount of any increase to the amount of our debt allocated to our lending activities. Because the proper tax treatment will depend upon the specific terms and conditions of our future borrowings and the uses of the cash from borrowings, our counsel cannot render an opinion on this issue. Such investors should consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of investing in our units. In addition, exempt investors that are required to distribute a certain portion of their assets every year, such as IRAs and 401(k) plans subject to the mandatory distribution requirements, should consider the fact that there will not be any market for our units when determining their ability to satisfy such mandatory distribution requirements. Corporate Investors The federal income tax consequences to investors that are corporations may differ materially from the tax consequences discussed in this section, particularly as they relate to the alternative minimum tax. Such investors should consult with their tax advisors as to the tax consequences to them of this investment. THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE DEPENDING UPON A PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS PARTICULAR SITUATION. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE UNITS, INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS. 78 Table of Contents INVESTMENT BY QUALIFIED PLANS AND IRAS Fiduciaries under ERISA Under the federal law commonly known as ERISA, fiduciaries of certain employee benefit plans (generally tax qualified plans) must act solely for the benefit of the plans participants and beneficiaries. A fiduciary must:  perform its duties with the skill, prudence and diligence of a prudent person;  diversify the plans investments so as to minimize the risk of large losses; and  act in accordance with the plans governing documents. Fiduciaries include anyone who exercises any control over the management of the Funds or other property of the plan. In addition, a plan participant who exercises control over his or her individual account in the qualified plan under a self-directed investment arrangement will generally be held responsible for the consequences of his or her investment decisions. Although IRAs generally are not subject to ERISAs fiduciary duty rules, they, as well as IRAs and self-directed accounts, are subject to the IRSs prohibited transaction rules, which are discussed below. We urge each fiduciary of an IRA or a qualified plan to consider these rules in the context of the particular circumstances of the IRA or the qualified plan before purchasing our units. Prohibited Transactions ERISA and the Code prohibit qualified plans and IRAs from engaging in certain transactions involving their assets, which are referred to as prohibited transactions, with certain parties, which are referred to as parties in interest or disqualified persons, respectively. For purposes of this discussion, such persons will be referred to as disqualified persons only. Disqualified persons generally include:  fiduciaries or other service providers of the qualified plan or IRA;  an employer whose employees are covered by the Plans IRA;  certain employers, officers, directors, certain shareholders and other owners of the company sponsoring the qualified plan; and  persons and legal entities sharing certain family or ownership relationships with other disqualified persons. In addition, the beneficiary of an IRA is generally considered to be a disqualified person for purposes of the prohibited transaction rules. Types of prohibited transactions include; for example:  sale, exchange or leasing of property between a plan and a disqualified individual;  direct or indirect transfers of a qualified plans or IRAs assets to, or use by or for the benefit of, a disqualified person;  the use of a qualified plans or IRAs assets by a fiduciary for his or her personal benefit; and  a fiduciary receiving cash or other consideration for his or her own benefit from a third-party in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the qualified plan or the IRA. Under ERISA, a fiduciary person that engages in a prohibited transaction must return any profits to the plan and pay back any losses to the plan. Also, the Code imposes excise taxes on a disqualified person that engages in a prohibited transaction. These prohibited transactions generally must be undone by the disqualified person to avoid additional penalties. In addition, if a taxpayer engages in a prohibited transaction with an IRA in which he or she is a beneficiary, the IRA will cease being an IRA and all of its assets will be treated as if they had been distributed to the taxpayer in the year in which the prohibited transaction occurred, which may result in additional penalties to the taxpayer. 79 Table of Contents Subject to the rules discussed below, in order to avoid a prohibited transaction under the Code or ERISA, our units may not be purchased by a qualified plan or an IRA with funds or other assets for which we or any of our affiliates are fiduciaries or other disqualified persons. Plan Assets In some circumstances, ERISA applies a look-through rule under which the assets of an entity in which a qualified plan or IRA has invested are deemed to be the assets of the qualified plan or the IRA itself. If our assets were determined to be plan assets, then fiduciaries of the qualified plans and IRAs that purchase our units might be subject to liability for actions that we take. In addition, some of the transactions described in this prospectus in which we might engage, including transactions with our affiliates, may be prohibited transactions. Moreover, fiduciaries of qualified plans or IRAs subject to ERISAs fiduciary duty rules that purchase our units might be deemed to have improperly delegated their fiduciary responsibilities to us. ERISA, however, exempts certain investments from the look-through rule. Under the Department of Labors current regulations, our assets will not be treated as plan assets of a qualified plan or IRA limited partner if:  our units are publicly offered, which means that among other things our units must be freely transferable and part of a class of units that is widely held as those terms are defined by ERISA;  less than 25% of the value of any class of our units are owned by qualified plans, IRAs, and certain other employee benefit investors; or  we are an operating company. We cannot be certain that our units will be deemed to be freely transferable or that they will be widely held under the regulation, or that we will be deemed to be an operating company, because those issues involve factual determinations. Therefore, we will rely on the less than 25% ownership exemption, and we will ensure that qualified plans, IRAs, and certain other employee benefit plan investors at all times own less than 25% of the total value of each class of our outstanding units. In making this determination, we will, as provided in the Department of Labors regulations, disregard the value of any units held by (i) our General Partner or our Investment Manager or other person (other than a benefit plan investor), who has discretionary authority or control with respect to our assets, (ii) any person who provides investment advice for a fee with respect to our assets, and (iii) any affiliate of those persons. Other ERISA Considerations In addition to the considerations described above in connection with the plan asset issue, a fiduciarys decision to cause a qualified plan or IRA to purchase our units should involve, among other factors, considerations that include whether:  the purchase is prudent in light of the illiquid nature of our units and potential minimum required distributions from the plan or IRA;  the investment will provide sufficient cash distributions in light of required benefit payments and other needs for liquidity;  the evaluation of the investment has properly taken into account the potential costs of determining and paying any amounts of federal income tax that may be owed on unrelated business taxable income derived from us; and  the fair market value of our units will be sufficiently ascertainable, and with sufficient frequency, to enable the qualified plan or IRA to value its assets in accordance with the rules and policies applicable to the qualified plan or IRA. 80 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION We will depend on our offering proceeds to carry on our proposed activities. We intend to use the offering proceeds, after paying the fees and expenses associated with our organization and this offering and to fund a capital reserve, to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. Many of our investments will be structured as full payout or operating leases. In addition, we intend to invest by way of participation agreements and residual sharing agreements where we would acquire an interest in a pool of equipment or other assets, or rights to those equipment or other assets, at a future date. We also may structure investments as project financings that are secured by, among other things, essential use equipment and/or assets. Finally, we may use other investment structures that our Investment Manager believes will provide us the appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize our return on investment while protecting against downside risk. In most cases, the structure will include us holding title to or a priority position in the equipment or other asset. In connection with transactions that have an associated revenue stream, we may sell such revenue stream on a discounted, non-recourse basis if our Investment Manager believes a sale of such revenue stream would increase our return on the investment while decreasing our exposure to the underlying investment and increase the proceeds available for additional investments. Initially, we intend to establish working capital reserves of approximately 1.0% of our offering proceeds, which we believe will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements. However, our operating costs will adversely affect our liquidity and to the extent that our working capital reserves are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we will increase our reserve requirements. Fluctuations in prevailing interest rates will affect us, because the cost of capital as reflected in interest rates is a significant factor in determining the market rate for our leases. Higher interest rates will:  reduce our yield on leveraged investments; and  reduce the amount of financing we may be able to obtain because of a reduction in value of our fixed-rate leases and secured financings. Interest rate changes generally will result in corresponding changes in rates on new leases as well as variable rate financing or new financing. Except as discussed above, interest rate fluctuations would generally have little or no effect on amounts payable under existing leases as their rates would generally be fixed. 81 Table of Contents SUMMARY OF OUR PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of our partnership agreement that are not covered elsewhere in this prospectus. The partnership agreement sets out the terms and conditions on which we will conduct our business and affairs, including the rights and obligations of you and our other limited partners. A copy of our partnership agreement is included as Appendix A to this prospectus. You should read the entire partnership agreement carefully before purchasing our units. General We are a Delaware limited partnership formed with SQN AIF III GP, LLC as our General Partner. Our registered office in Delaware is c/o The Company Corporation, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, Delaware 19998. We may change our registered office place of business by written notice to you. Our General Partners offices are located at 48 Wall Street, 24th Floor, New York, New York 10005. Our term began when we filed a certificate of limited partnership with the Delaware Secretary of State on March 10, 2010. Under our partnership agreement, we will terminate at midnight on December 31, 2034, or earlier if a dissolution event occurs as described in  Events Causing Dissolution, below. However, our General Partner anticipates that our actual term before we cease operations as a limited partnership and liquidate our assets will be much shorter, approximately seven years after the date of this prospectus. Capital Contributions Our General Partner contributed $100 in cash as its capital contribution to us in exchange for a 1% interest in our income, losses and cash distributions. Each limited partner and our General Partner and its affiliates will contribute $1,000 to our capital for each unit purchased. You and our other limited partners are not obligated to make additional capital contributions to us, except as described below under  Limited Liability of Limited Partners. Powers of our General Partner Except as otherwise specifically provided in our partnership agreement, our General Partner will have complete and exclusive discretion in the management of our business. You will not be permitted to participate in our management. Except to the extent limited by Delaware law, our General Partner may delegate any or all of its duties under the partnership agreement to another person, including any of its affiliates or independent third-parties. The partnership agreement designates our General Partner as our tax matters partner and directs it to represent us and you and our other limited partners in all examinations and proceedings of our affairs by tax authorities, and to expend our funds in doing so. Liability of Our General Partner Our General Partner will be liable for all of our general obligations to the extent we do not pay them. However, our General Partner will not have any personal liability for:  obligations that are specifically nonrecourse to us; or  the repayment of your capital contribution. Limited Liability of Limited Partners Our units are not assessable, and you will not have any personal liability for any of our obligations or liabilities. You will only be liable for our obligations and liabilities to the extent of your capital contribution and your pro rata share of our undistributed profits and other assets. However, if you participate in the management or control of our affairs, you may be deemed under Delaware law to be acting as a general partner and you may lose your limited liability as against third-parties who reasonably believe, in doing business with us, that you are a general partner. In addition, Delaware law provides that you may be liable to 82 Table of Contents us for a distribution we make to you if, after giving effect to the distribution, our liabilities exceed the fair value of our assets. Withdrawal or Removal of Our General Partner Our General Partner may not voluntarily withdraw as our General Partner without:  60 days advance written notice to you and our other limited partners;  obtaining an opinion of counsel that the withdrawal will not cause our termination as a limited partnership or materially and adversely affect our federal tax status as a partnership; and  the selection of a substitute general partner by limited partners owning a majority of our units. Our General Partner may be removed by limited partners owning a majority of our units. Neither our General Partner nor any of its affiliates may participate in any vote by our limited partners to remove our General Partner as general partner or appoint a substitute general partner. Consequences of Withdrawal or Removal of Our General Partner On the withdrawal or removal of our General Partner, we must pay our General Partner the fair market value of its partnership interest, plus or minus, as the case may be, accrued but unpaid fees owed to our General Partner by us and the difference between any other amounts owed to our General Partner by us and any amounts owed to us by our General Partner. The method of payment must be fair and protect our solvency and liquidity. The method of payment is deemed fair if:  in a voluntary withdrawal, it provides for a non-interest bearing unsecured promissory note with principal payable only from distributions from us that our General Partner otherwise would have received; or  in an involuntary removal, it provides for a rate of interest equal to the lesser of the rate we would obtain from an unrelated bank lender for an unsecured 60-month loan or the Prime Rate of interest published in the Money Rates section of the Wall Street Journal, plus 4%, and provides for payment of principal and interest in 60 equal monthly installments. Liability of Withdrawn or Removed General Partner After the withdrawal or removal of our General Partner as our General Partner, it will remain liable for all obligations and liabilities incurred by it or by us while it was acting as our General Partner and for which it was liable as our General Partner. Our General Partner will be free of any obligation or liability arising from our activities after the time its withdrawal or removal becomes effective. Transfer of Units There is no public or secondary market for our units, and we do not expect that a market will develop. Generally, you may transfer or assign your units to any person, whom we call an assignee, only if you satisfy the following conditions:  you and the assignee sign a document that our General Partner reasonably determines satisfies the following:  states your intention that the assignee is to become a substitute limited partner, if that is the case;  shows that there is a legal transfer and binds the assignee to all of the terms and provisions of our partnership agreement;  includes a representation by both you and the assignee that the assignment or transfer complies with all applicable laws, including the applicable minimum investment and investor suitability requirements under state securities laws; and  the assignee pays us a fee that will not exceed $150 for our expenses. 83 Table of Contents Also, unless our General Partner consents, no units may be assigned:  to a minor or incompetent unless a guardian, custodian or conservator has been appointed for the person;  to any person if, in our counsels opinion, the assignment would terminate our taxable year or adversely affect our status as a limited partnership for federal income tax purposes;  to any person if, in our counsels opinion, the assignment would affect our existence or qualification as a limited partnership under Delaware law or the laws of any other jurisdiction in which we conduct business;  to any person not permitted, in our counsels opinion, to be an assignee under applicable law, including federal and state securities laws;  if the assignment is for less than 25 units unless the assignment is for all of your units;  if the assignment would result in your keeping a portion of your units that is less than the greater of:  25 units; or  the minimum number of units required to be purchased under the minimum investment standards applicable under the state securities laws to your initial purchase of units; or  if, in our counsels opinion, the effect of the assignment would be to cause the equity participation in us by certain benefit plan and IRA investors to equal or exceed 25% of the value of any class of our total outstanding units at any time. Any attempt to assign or transfer units in violation of our partnership agreement or applicable law will be ineffective. We will recognize assignments of units as of the last day of the month in which all conditions to the assignment have been satisfied, and we will amend our partnership agreement at least quarterly to effect the substitution of substitute limited partners. In addition, our partnership agreement provides that so long as there are adverse federal income tax consequences from being treated as a publicly traded partnership, in our counsels opinion, we will not permit any interest in a unit to be assigned or sold which does not meet at least one of the secondary market safe harbors set forth in the Treasury Regulations. Under these rules, for example, any transfer that would cause the total of all unit transfers or assignments in a taxable year (including any redemptions of units by us) to exceed 2% of our total capital or profits interests, excluding exempted private transfers, would be prohibited. We anticipate that the private transfers and the 2% lack of actual trading safe harbors will be the only safe harbors potentially available to you and our other limited partners. For a more detailed summary of these safe harbors, see the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Publicly Traded Partnership section of this prospectus. If we determine that a purported transfer or assignment of a unit was effected on a secondary market, we have the right to refuse to recognize the proposed transfer or assignment and take any action we deem necessary or appropriate so that the proposed transfer or assignment is not in fact recognized. Also, you must provide us with all information with regard to any transfer or assignment of your units (or any proposed transfer or assignment of your units) that we deem necessary to determine whether it occurred or will occur on a secondary market. Redemption of Units We are permitted by the partnership agreement to redeem your units on your request at any time. However, any redemption of units is in our General Partners sole discretion. For a more complete discussion of the redemption of units, you should read the Redemption of Units section of this prospectus. Books and Records We will maintain our books and records at our General Partners principal office. You or your representative will have the right, on written request, subject to reasonable notice and at your own expense, to inspect and copy, at our General Partners principal office, any partnership books and records that we 84 Table of Contents maintain. You also will have the right to have a copy of a list of our limited partners (the Participant List described below) mailed to you for a reasonable copying charge. However, you must first certify that the list will not be:  reproduced and sold to another party;  used for any commercial purpose unrelated to your interest in partnership matters; or  used for an unlawful purpose. The Participant List is an alphabetical list of the names, addresses, and business telephone numbers of our limited partners along with the number of units held by each of them. The Participant List is maintained as part of our books and records, and will be updated at least quarterly to reflect changes in the information it contains. If we or our General Partner neglect or refuse to exhibit, produce, or mail a copy of the Participant List as requested, our General Partner will be liable to any limited partner requesting the list for the costs, including attorneys fees, incurred by that limited partner for compelling the production of the Participant List, and for actual damages suffered by any limited partner by reason of such refusal or neglect. It is a defense that the actual purpose and reason for the request for inspection or for a copy of the Participant List is to secure the Participant List or other information for the purpose of selling the list or copies of the list, or using the list or other information for a commercial purpose other than in the interest of the applicant as a limited partner relative to our affairs. Thus, our General Partner will require the limited partner requesting the Participant List to first represent that the list is not being requested for a commercial purpose unrelated to the limited partners interest in us. The remedies provided to our limited partners requesting copies of the Participant List are in addition to, and do not in any way limit, other remedies available to our limited partners under federal law or the laws of any state. Meetings of Limited Partners There will be no annual or other periodic meetings of the limited partners. However, a meeting of our limited partners must be called by our General Partner following its receipt of written request(s), either in person or by registered mail, for a meeting on any matter on which our limited partners may vote from limited partners holding 10% or more of the then outstanding units. Every request by our limited partners for a meeting must state with reasonable specificity the purpose(s) for which the meeting is to be held and the text of any matter, resolution or action proposed to be voted on by our limited partners at the meeting. Within 10 days following the receipt of the request, our General Partner will give notice to all limited partners of the meeting, and the time and place of the meeting in the manner specified in our partnership agreement. In addition, our General Partner may, and if so requested by our limited partners in the manner described above, must, submit the proposed matter, resolution or action for action by consent of our limited partners, in lieu of a meeting. Also, our General Partner may call meetings of our limited partners at any time. However, in lieu of a meeting, any matter that could be voted on at a meeting of our limited partners may be submitted by our General Partner for action by consent of our limited partners. Voting Rights of Limited Partners Limited partners owning a majority of our units may take action on any of the following matters without our General Partners concurrence:  an amendment of our partnership agreement, subject to certain limitations discussed in  Amendment by Limited Partners Without Our General Partners Concurrence, below;  our dissolution;  the removal of our General Partner and the election of one or more substitute general partners;  the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, except in connection with securitization financings or sales in the ordinary course of liquidating our investments after the Operating Period; and 85 Table of Contents  the cancellation of any contract for services to us with our General Partner or its affiliates, subject to certain exceptions, such as the Management, Origination and Servicing Agreement, without penalty on 60 days notice. Our General Partner and its affiliates may not vote or consent on matters submitted to our limited partners regarding the removal of our General Partner and the election of a substitute general partner or regarding any transaction between us and our General Partner or any of its affiliates. In determining the requisite percentage of units necessary to approve a matter on which our General Partner or its affiliates may not vote or consent, any units owned by our General Partner or its affiliates cannot be included in either the numerator or the denominator. Limited partners who dissent from any matter approved by limited partners owning a majority of our units are bound by the vote and do not have a right to appraisal or automatic repurchase of their units. Amendment by Limited Partners Without Our General Partners Concurrence Amendments of our partnership agreement by our limited partners without our General Partners concurrence may not allow our limited partners to take part in the control or management of us or our business, or contract away our General Partners fiduciary duties to our limited partners. In addition, any proposed amendment of the partnership agreement that would:  change how our partnership agreement can be amended, will require the consent of all of our limited partners;  alter the rights, powers, duties or obligations of our General Partner, will require our General Partners consent; or  adversely affect any partners share of our cash distributions will require the consent of each partner affected by the change. Amendment by Our General Partner Without the Consent of the Limited Partners Our General Partner may, without the consent of you and our other limited partners, amend our partnership agreement for the benefit or protection of you and our other limited partners, including any one or more of the following:  adding to our General Partners duties or obligations, or surrendering any of its rights or powers;  curing any ambiguity in, or correcting or supplementing any provision of, our partnership agreement;  preserving our status as a limited partnership for federal income tax purposes;  deleting or adding any provision that the SEC or any other regulatory body or official requires to be deleted or added; or  changing our name or the location of our principal office. Events Causing Dissolution We will dissolve when any of the following events occurs:  withdrawal or removal of our General Partner if a substitute general partner has not been admitted;  our dissolution is approved on a vote of limited partners owning a majority of our units;  the sale of all or substantially all of our assets other than in connection with a financing transaction, such as a securitization;  the expiration of our term; or  any other event which would cause us to dissolve under Delaware law. 86 Table of Contents Liquidation When a dissolution event occurs, we will liquidate our investments and other assets and distribute the proceeds, after we pay our debts and expenses, to our partners in accordance with their percentage ownership in us. Our existence will terminate once we have paid all our debts and expenses and made final distributions to our partners. You are not guaranteed the return of, or a return on, your investment in us as a result of any of these distributions. Roll-Up Transactions We may enter into a roll-up transaction only on the vote or consent of limited partners owning a majority of our units and on satisfaction of certain other conditions described below. A roll-up transaction generally is a transaction involving the acquisition, merger, conversion or consolidation of us, as a partnership, with an entity created by, or surviving, the transaction (the roll-up entity), and the issuance of securities by the roll-up entity. The term roll-up does not cover specified transactions, including our conversion into a different legal form, if there will be no significant adverse change in unit voting rights, our term, the compensation we pay our General Partner and its affiliates, our investment objectives or the federal income tax consequences of owning a unit.  In order for us to enter into a proposed roll-up transaction, the additional conditions set forth below must be met. All of our assets must be appraised by a competent, independent expert, which our partnership agreement defines as a person with no material current or prior business or personal relationship with our General Partner or its affiliates who is engaged to a substantial extent in the business of rendering appraisals and who is qualified to perform the work. If the appraisal will be included in a prospectus used to offer the securities of a roll-up entity, the appraisal must be filed with the SEC and the states as an exhibit to the registration statement for the offering. Our assets must be appraised on a consistent basis, and the appraisal must be based on an evaluation of all relevant information and indicate the value of our assets as of a date immediately prior to the announcement of the proposed roll-up transaction. The appraisal must assume an orderly liquidation of our assets over a 12 month period. The terms of the engagement of the independent expert must clearly state that the engagement is for the benefit of us and our limited partners. A summary of the independent appraisal, indicating all material assumptions underlying the appraisal, must be included in a report to our limited partners in connection with the proposed roll-up transaction.  The sponsor of the proposed roll-up transaction must offer to our limited partners who vote no on the proposal the option of either:  accepting the roll-up securities; or  one of the following: - remaining as limited partners in us on the same terms and conditions as existed previously; or - receiving cash equal to the limited partners pro rata share of the appraised value of our net assets.  We may not participate in any proposed roll-up transaction that would result in our limited partners having voting rights that are less than those provided for under our partnership agreement. If the roll-up entity is a limited partnership, the voting rights of our limited partners must correspond to the voting rights provided for in our partnership agreement to the greatest extent possible.  We may not participate in any proposed roll-up transaction that includes provisions that would operate to materially impede or frustrate the accumulation of units by any purchaser of the securities of the roll-up entity (except to the minimum extent necessary to preserve the tax status of the roll-up entity). We may not participate in any proposed roll-up transaction that would limit the ability of a limited partner to exercise the voting rights of that limited partners units of the roll-up entity on the basis of the number of our units held by that limited partner. 87 Table of Contents  We may not participate in any proposed roll-up transaction in which our limited partners rights of access to the records of the roll-up entity would be less than those provided for under our partnership agreement.  We may not participate in any proposed roll-up transaction in which any of the costs of the transaction would be borne by us if the roll-up transaction is not approved by our limited partners. REDEMPTION OF UNITS Redemption Price of Units Your units are illiquid and can be redeemed by us only if the redemption provisions in our partnership agreement, which are summarized below, are met. If we do redeem your units, which may include a reasonable administrative fee charged to you and is in our General Partners sole discretion, the redemption price for your units will depend on when you present your units for redemption. If you present your units for redemption:  during the Offering Period and Operating Period, the redemption price will equal not less than $850 per unit, less distributions previously paid to you; or  during the Liquidation Period, the redemption price will equal the equity for one unit as set forth on our balance sheet in our most recent periodic report filed with the SEC before your redemption request, less distributions paid to you since the date of the balance sheet. We will not establish any specific reserves for the redemption of units. Redemptions may be made from our operating income, general reserves, additional limited partner capital contributions or any other sources not prohibited by our partnership agreement. The redemption price for your units is unlikely to reflect the fair market value of your units at the time of redemption, particularly during the Liquidation Period. You may realize a greater return by holding on to your units for the duration of our term. Procedure for Redemption of Units To redeem your units, you must send us a written request in a form satisfactory to us. The request must be signed by all of the owners of the units. We will consider redemption requests to have been made on the earlier of the date the request is personally delivered with receipt acknowledged, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, at our General Partners address set forth in this prospectus. We will accept or deny redemption requests quarterly. Restrictions on Redemption of Units We have no obligation to redeem your units, and will do so only in our General Partners sole discretion. Beginning when you are admitted as a limited partner and at any time thereafter, you may request that we redeem your units. In any calendar year, we will not redeem any units that, in the aggregate, together with all other transfers of units made to date during the calendar year, subject to certain exceptions, exceed 2% of our total capital or profits interests, or that we reasonably believe might exceed 2% of our total capital or profits interests, as of the last day of the calendar year. This limitation is required so that we will not be treated as a publicly traded partnership for tax purposes. If we believe that the 2% limitation may be reached before year-end, we may redeem only a portion, or none, of the units for which redemption is sought, and we may decide to allocate, at the date of request or later in the year, redemption capacity based on the financial hardship of the limited partners requesting redemption. In addition, we will not redeem units if, in our General Partner s sole discretion, we do not have sufficient cash on hand. We intend to reinvest a substantial portion of our revenues during the Operating Period, which begins with the initial closing date in this offering and ends three years later. Also, we will not redeem units if the redemption would impair our capital or our operations, which our General Partner will 88 Table of Contents decide in its sole discretion. Cash used to redeem units will reduce our cash available for making investments, reinvestments and distributions to our remaining limited partners. If we receive requests to redeem more units than there are funds available to redeem, we expect to give priority:  first, to hardship redemptions (e.g., requests arising from death, major medical expense, family emergency, disability, a material loss of family income, etc.);  second, to provide liquidity for IRAs or qualified plans to meet required distributions; and  third, to all other redemption requests. Additionally, we will not redeem any units that would result in 25% or more of the value of any of the remaining units of any class being held be qualified plans, IRAs or other benefit plan investors (as defined for purposes of ERISA). Consequences of Redemption of Units If we redeem all of your units, then you will no longer be a limited partner and you will have no interest in us. However, a redemption of all of your units will not release you from liability to us to the extent of any distributions, including any return of or on your investment, made to you in violation of Delaware law. Also, any gain realized by you on the redemption of your units, if you held them as a capital asset and held them for more than one year, generally will be a capital gain, but your gain may be treated as ordinary income to the extent of your share of:  recapture of your cost recovery deductions on our equipment and other assets leased to others under operating leases;  our substantially appreciated inventory items; and  our unrealized receivables. See the Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  Sale or Other Disposition of Units section of this prospectus. You are urged to seek advice based on your particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences to you of a redemption of your units. 89 Table of Contents REPORTS TO LIMITED PARTNERS Tax Reports As soon as practicable each year we will send you a statement on Form K-1 of your share of our income, gains, losses, deductions and other tax items for the previous calendar year just ended to enable you to prepare your income tax returns.

Organization and Nature of Operations SQN AIF III GP, LLC (the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SQN Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Capital or Parent). The primary activity of the Company is to sponsor, manage and act as the general partner of SQN Alternative Investment Fund III L.P. (the Managed Fund), a publicly registered equipment leasing and finance fund in the United States of America. The Company was formed on March 8, 2010 as a Delaware limited liability company.

The Managed Fund is in the process of filing a registration statement (Form S-1) with the Securities Exchange Commission and will operate as a publicly registered equipment leasing and finance fund for the purpose of investing in a diverse pool of business-essential equipment and physical assets. The Company will be entitled to 1% of the Managed Funds profits, losses, cash distributions and liquidation proceeds. The Companys fiscal year ends on December 31. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of presentation  The accompanying balance sheet of the Company has been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). Cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include cash maintained in checking and savings accounts at financial institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less.

Uncertain tax positions  The Company follows the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (Uncertain Tax Position). Uncertain Tax Position prescribes recognition thresholds that must be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under Uncertain Tax Position, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold. The Company has evaluated its tax position at March 31, 2010, and does not expect a material adjustment to be made. Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Subsequent events  The Company has evaluated events and transactions that occurred between April 1, 2010 and April 20, 2010, which is the date the financial statement was issued, for possible disclosure and F-4 Table of Contents SQN AIF III GP, LLC Notes to Balance Sheet  (Continued) recognition in the financial statement.

Transactions with Related Parties As discussed in Note 2, the Company may be reimbursed for expenses incurred on behalf of the Managed Fund for the organization and offering of the Managed Fund, and is entitled to 1% of the Managed Funds profits, losses, cash distributions and liquidation proceeds and reimbursement for administrative expenses incurred in relation to the Managed Funds operations.

(iv) The General Partner and its Affiliates shall not be reimbursed by the Partnership for amounts expended by them with respect to the following: (A) salaries, fringe benefits, travel expenses or other administrative items incurred by or allocated to any Controlling Person of the General Partner or its Affiliates; or (B) rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or, subject to clause (iii), other administrative items. 9.5 Other Interests of the General Partner and its Affiliates (a) General Partners Right to Pursue Other Activities. The General Partner shall be required to devote only such time to the affairs of the Partnership as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines in good faith to be necessary for the business and operations of the Partnership. The General Partner and its Affiliates may engage in, or possess an interest in, business ventures (other than the Partnership) of every kind and description, independently or with others, including, but not limited to, serving as sponsor or general partner of other Programs and participating in the equipment leasing or financing business, whether or not those business ventures are competitive with the business or Investments of the Partnership; provided, however, that the General Partner and its Affiliates may not offer for sale interests in another Program before the Offering Termination Date unless the other Programs have investment objectives that are different from the Partnerships or the other Programs are Specified Equipment Programs. The Partnership and the Limited Partners shall have no rights in or to the General Partners and its Affiliates independent ventures or the related income or profits resulting from them. Except as set forth in the Prospectus, the General Partner and its Affiliates shall not be obligated to present any particular investment opportunity to the Partnership. The General Partner and its Affiliates shall have the right to invest in equipment, portfolios of equipment subject to existing equipment leases, equipment financing, and in leasing and re-leasing opportunities on its or their own behalf or on behalf of other Programs. The General Partner and its Affiliates shall have the right, subject only to the provisions of Section 9.5(b), to take for their own account (individually or otherwise), or to recommend to any Affiliated Program, any particular investment opportunity. (b) Resolving Conflicts. Any conflicts in determining and allocating Investments between the General Partner and its Affiliated Programs, on the one hand, and the Partnership, on the other hand, shall be resolved by the Investment Committee, which will evaluate the suitability of all prospective Investments. If the Investments available from time to time to the Partnership and to other Affiliated Programs are less than the aggregate amount of the Investments then sought by them, an available Investment shall be allocated by the A-25 Table of Contents General Partner to an Affiliated Program (including the Partnership) after taking into consideration at least the following factors: (i) which Affiliated Program has been seeking Investments or reinvesting Cash Flow from its Investments for the longest period of time; (ii) whether the Affiliated Program has the cash required for the Investment; (iii) whether the amount of debt to be incurred with respect to the Investment is acceptable for the Affiliated Program; (iv) the effect the Investment would have on the Affiliated Programs cash flow; (v) whether the Investment would further diversify, or unduly concentrate, the Affiliated Programs Investments in a particular lessee, class or type of equipment, location, industry, etc.; and (vi) whether the term of the Investment is within the term of the Affiliated Program. If conflicts arise between the Partnership and one or more Affiliated Program, which may be seeking to realize on investments in similar Investments at the same time, the first opportunity to realize on such investments or Investments shall generally be allocated by the General Partner or its Affiliates to the Affiliated Program (including the Partnership) whose investments are closer to maturity and, in the case of investments with the same maturity, the oldest investment. However, the General Partner or its Affiliates, in their discretion, may make exceptions to this general policy where an Investment is subject to remarketing commitments which provide otherwise or in cases in which, in the General Partners judgment, other circumstances make the application of such policy inequitable or not economically feasible for a particular Affiliated Program (including the Partnership). If the financing available from time to time to two or more Affiliated Programs (including the Partnership) is less than the aggregate amount then sought by them, the available financing generally shall be allocated to the Affiliated Program (including the Partnership) that has been seeking financing for the longest period of time. 9.6 Minimum Requirement for Investments/Maximum Front-End Fees. Under the NASAA Guidelines, the Partnership is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Offerings Proceeds to Investment in Equipment, which shall be deemed to be Investments for the purposes of this Agreement, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80% of the Gross Offerings Proceeds reduced by 0.0625% for each 1% of indebtedness encumbering the Partnerships Investments; or (ii) 75% of such Gross Offerings Proceeds. The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of this Agreement are subject to the application of the Sponsor Fee Limit provided in Section 9.4(e), which limits the annual amount payable to the General Partner, the Investment Manager and their Affiliates as the Management Fee and the Promotional Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the maximum amount of fees that would be payable to the General Partner, the Investment Manager and their Affiliates under specified provisions of the NASAA Guidelines. Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of Net Offering Proceeds to acquisition of Investments and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt encumbering such Investments, the General Partner shall calculate the maximum front-end fees, carried interest and promotional interest payable to the General Partner, the Investment Manager and their Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Management Fee and Promotional Interest to be paid pursuant to this Agreement. If and to the extent that the fees exceed the Sponsor Fee Limit provided in Section 9.4(e), the fees payable to the General Partner and the Investment Manager shall be reduced as described herein. In such event, Section 9.4(e) of this Agreement shall be amended immediately to reduce the amounts calculated as the Promotional Interest by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the limitations in the NASAA Guidelines on the aggregate of promotional interests and carried interests. A comparison of the Front-End Fees, Management Fees and Promotional Interest actually paid by the Partnership to the General Partner, the Investment Manager and their Affiliates and the NASAA Guideline maximums shall be repeated, and any required adjustments shall be made, at least annually thereafter. A-26 Table of Contents ARTICLE X  OWNERS AND LIABILITIES OF LIMITED PARTNERS 10.1 Absence of Control Over Partnership Business. The Limited Partners hereby consent to the exercise by the General Partner of the powers conferred on the General Partner by this Agreement. No Limited Partner shall have any of the following rights: (i) the right to participate in or have any control over the Partnerships business; (ii) the right or authority to act for, or to bind or otherwise obligate, the Partnership (except if the Limited Partner also is a General Partner, and then only in its capacity as a General Partner); (iii) the right to have the Partnership dissolved and liquidated, except as provided in Section 16.2 through the Consent or vote of the Majority Interest of the Limited Partners; or (iv) the right to have all or any part of the Limited Partners Capital Contribution or Capital Account returned, except as provided in this Agreement. 10.2 Limited Liability. The liability of each Limited Partner, in his capacity as a Limited Partner, shall be limited to the amount of the Limited Partners Capital Contribution and pro rata share of any undistributed Income, Cash Flow and other assets of the Partnership. Except as may otherwise be required by law or by this Agreement, after a Limited Partner pays his entire Capital Contribution to the Partnership as set forth on his Subscription Agreement for the purchase of his Units, the Limited Partner shall not: (i) have any further obligations to the Partnership; (ii) be subject to any additional Assessment; or (iii) be required to make any additional Capital Contribution to, or to loan any funds to, the Partnership. ARTICLE XI  DISTRIBUTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS 11.1 Distribution of Distributable Cash (a) Distributions Prior to the Admission of Limited Partners. Prior to the admission to the Partnership of any Limited Partners, distributions of Distributable Cash shall be made 1% to the General Partner and 99% to the Original Limited Partner. (b) Distributions After the Admission of Limited Partners. Subject to 9.4(b), beginning with the admission to the Partnership of any Limited Partner on the Initial Closing Date, provided that sufficient Distributable Cash is available and subject to the General Partners right to reinvest all or any portion of Net Disposition Proceeds pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(xxv), the General Partner shall, in its sole discretion, distribute Distributable Cash to the Partners in the following order of priority: (i) first, prior to Payout, 1% to the General Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners; and (ii) thereafter, 20% to the General Partner and 80% to the Limited Partners. Subject to this Section 11.1(b), distributions of Distributable Cash, if any, shall be made to the Partners at such times and in such amounts as determined by the General Partner, in its sole discretion, based on the amount of the Partnerships then available Distributable Cash and other funds of the Partnership and the General Partners estimate of the Partnerships total Distributable Cash for the Fiscal Year. During the Operating Period, the General Partner intends, but is not required, to make distributions semi-annually in aggregate amounts equal to 6% per annum of the Capital Contributions of the Partners. 11.2 Allocations of Income and Loss (a) Income and Loss. Except as otherwise provided herein, Income, Loss and, to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Capital Accounts of the Partners in a manner that as closely as possible gives economic effect to the provisions of Articles IX, XI, XIV and the other relevant provisions of this Agreement. A-27 Table of Contents (b) Special Allocations. The following special allocations shall, except as otherwise provided, be made prior to allocations in Sections 11.2(a) in the following order: (i) Minimum Gain Charge-Back. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XI, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain or in any Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Period, before any other allocation under this Article XI each Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership Income and gain for the Fiscal Period (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal Periods) in an amount and manner required by Treas. Reg. Sections 1.704-2(f) and 1.704-2(i)(4) or any successor provisions. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-2(j)(2) or any successor provision. (ii) Partnership Nonrecourse Deductions. Partnership Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Period shall be allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner. (iii) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Period shall be allocated to the Partner who made or guaranteed or is otherwise liable with respect to the loan to which the Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with the principles of Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-2(i) or any successor provision. (iv) Qualified Income Offset. If in any Fiscal Period, any Partner has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, whether resulting from an unexpected adjustment, allocation or distribution described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) or otherwise, the Partner shall be allocated items of Partnership Income (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of Partnership Income for the Fiscal Period, including gross income and gain for such Fiscal Period) sufficient to eliminate the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as quickly as possible, to the extent required by Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). It is the intention of the parties that this allocation provision constitute a qualified income offset within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). (v) Curative Allocations. The special allocations provided for in Section 11.2(e) and in Sections 11.2(b)(i) through (iv) are intended to comply with Treas. Reg. Sections 1.704-1 and 1.704- 2. To the extent that any of those special allocations have been made, subsequent allocations of Income, Loss and items thereof (curative allocations) shall be made as soon as possible and in a manner so as to cause, to the extent possible without violating the requirements of Treas. Reg. Sections 1.704-1 and 1.704-2, the Partners Capital Account balances to be as nearly as possible in the same proportions in which they would have been had the special allocations not occurred. In making these curative allocations, due regard shall be given to the character of the Income and Loss and items thereof that were originally allocated under the provisions of Section 11.2(a) and Sections 11.2(b)(i) through (iv) in order to put the Partners as nearly as possible in the positions in which they would have been had those special allocations not occurred. (c) Misallocated Items. If the General Partner determines, after consultation with Counsel, that the allocation of any item of Income or Loss is not specified in this Article XI (an unallocated item), or that the allocation of any item of Income or Loss under this Article XI is clearly inconsistent with the Partners economic interests in the Partnership determined by reference to this Agreement, the general principles of Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-1(b) and the factors set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-1(b)(3)(ii) (a misallocated item), then the General Partner may allocate the unallocated items, and reallocate the misallocated items, to reflect the Partners economic interests in the Partnership. (d) Special Allocation of State, Local and Foreign Taxes. Any state, local or foreign taxes imposed on the Partnership by reason of a Partner being a citizen, resident or national of a state, locality or foreign jurisdiction, including any item(s) of Income or Loss resulting therefrom, shall be specially allocated to that Partner. (e) Transactions with Partnership. If, and to the extent that, any Partner is deemed to recognize any item of Income or Loss as a result of any transaction between the Partner and the Partnership pursuant to Code Sections 482, 483, 1272-1274, 7872 or any similar provision of the Code now or hereafter in effect, any A-28 Table of Contents corresponding Income or Loss or items thereof shall be allocated to the Partner who was charged with that item. (f) Fees and Commissions Paid to General Partner. It is the intent of the Partnership that any amount paid or deemed paid to the General Partner or Affiliates as a fee or other payment described in Section 9.4 shall be treated as a guaranteed payment or a payment to a partner not acting in his capacity as a partner pursuant to Section 707(c) of the Code to the extent possible. If a fee or payment is deemed to be a distribution to the General Partner, and not a guaranteed payment or a payment to a partner not acting in his capacity as a partner, the General Partner shall be allocated an amount of Partnership gross ordinary income equal to the payment. (g) Distribution Expenses, Acquisition Fees and Organization and Offering Expense Allowance. Distribution Expenses, Acquisition Fees and the Organization and Offering Expense Allowance shall be allocated 100% to the Limited Partners. Organization and Offering Expenses in excess of the Organization and Offering Expense Allowance shall be allocated 100% to the General Partner. (h) Tax-Exempt Entities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if it is determined that the tax-exempt use property rules of Section 168(h)(6) of the Code apply to the Partnership, because any Limited Partner is a tax-exempt entity (as defined by the Code Section 168(h)(2)), so that any portion of the Partnerships depreciation or cost recovery deductions is reduced, suspended or otherwise adversely affected, the resulting depreciation adjustments shall be specially allocated 100% to (i.e., borne by) such tax-exempt entity Limited Partners and shall be shared among such Limited Partners in proportion to their respective number of Units unless otherwise allocated among them by this Agreement or the Code. 11.3 Distributions and Allocations Among the Limited Partners (a) In General. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, all distributions of Distributable Cash and all allocations of Income and Loss and items thereof for any Fiscal Year or Fiscal Period shall be distributed or allocated, as the case may be, among the Limited Partners in proportion to their respective numbers of Units. Each distribution of Distributable Cash shall be made to the Limited Partners (or their respective assignees) of record as of the last day of the month next preceding the date on which the distribution is made. (b) Initial Year of Admission. All distributions of Distributable Cash and all allocations of Income and Loss or items thereof for any Fiscal Year in which any Limited Partners are admitted to the Partnership shall be allocated among the Limited Partners as follows: (i) first, the Operations and Sales of the Partnership shall be deemed to have occurred ratably over the Fiscal Year, irrespective of the actual results of Operations or Sales of the Partnership; (ii) second, all Income and Loss for the Fiscal Year shall be allocated among the Limited Partners in the ratio that the number of Units held by each Limited Partner multiplied by the number of days in the Fiscal Year that the Units were held by the Limited Partner bears to the sum of that calculation for all Limited Partners; and (iii) third, all semi-annual distributions of cash made to the Limited Partners under Section 11.1 shall be distributed among the Limited Partners in the ratio that the number of Units held by each Limited Partner multiplied by the number of days in the semi-annual period preceding the semi-annual period in which the distribution is made that the Units were held by the Limited Partner bears to the sum of that calculation for all Limited Partners. If the General Partner determines at any time that the sum of the semi-annual period distributions made to any Limited Partner during or with respect to a Fiscal Year does not (or will not) properly reflect the Limited Partners share of the total distributions made or to be made by the Partnership for the Fiscal Year, the General Partner shall, as soon as practicable, make a supplemental distribution to the Limited Partner, or withhold from a subsequent distribution that otherwise would be payable to the Limited Partner, an amount that will cause the total distributions to the Limited Partner for the Fiscal Year to be the proper amount. A-29 Table of Contents (c) Transfer. In the event of a transfer of a Unit during a Fiscal Year in accordance with Article XIII, the transferor and transferee shall be allocated a ratable share of Income and Loss for the Fiscal Year based on the number of days in the Fiscal Year that each held the transferred Unit. (d) Application of Distributions. Solely for purposes of calculating a Limited Partners Cumulative Return, each distribution made to a Limited Partner under Sections 11.1, 11.5 or 14.3, and any interest earned on a Limited Partners subscription funds while held in an Escrow Account before the admission of the Limited Partner to the Partnership and subsequently paid to the Limited Partner under Section 8.11 or while held in the escrow account established for residents of Pennsylvania before the admission of the Limited Partner to the Partnership and subsequently paid to the Limited Partner under Section 8.12, shall be deemed to be applied as follows: (i) first, in reduction of the Limited Partners Unpaid Cumulative Return, to the extent thereof, as determined immediately before the distribution; and (ii) thereafter, in reduction of the Limited Partners Adjusted Capital Contribution, as determined immediately before the distribution. 11.4 Tax Allocations: Code Section 704(c); Revaluations (a) Contribution of Property. In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, Income, Loss and items thereof with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Partnership shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Partners so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of the property to the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and its initial Gross Asset Value. (b) Adjustments. In the event the Gross Asset Value of any Partnership asset is adjusted pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 1.1(43), subsequent allocations of Income, Loss, and items thereof with respect to the asset shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of the asset for federal income tax purposes and its Gross Asset Value in a manner consistent with the requirements of Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-3(a)(6). (c) Elections. Any elections or other decisions relating to the allocations required by subsections (a) and (b), above, shall be made in a manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of this Agreement. Allocations under this subsection (c) are solely for purposes of federal, state, and local income taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Partners Capital Account or share of Income or Loss under any provision of this Agreement. 11.5 Return of Uninvested Capital Contribution. If 100% of the Partnerships Net Offering Proceeds has not been used to make Investments, committed to Reserves (to the extent Reserves have been established and maintained for the acquisition of Investments) or used to pay permitted Front-End Fees within 24 months from the date of the Prospectus, the amount of the uninvested Net Offering Proceeds shall be promptly distributed by the Partnership to the Limited Partners, pro rata based on their respective number of Units, as a return of capital, without interest. Funds shall be deemed to have been committed to investment and need not be returned to the Limited Partners to the extent written agreements in principle, commitment letters, letters of intent or understanding, option agreements or any similar contracts are executed and not terminated during the applicable 24-month period described above, if the investments are ultimately consummated within a further period of 12 months. Funds deemed committed which are not actually so invested within the 12 month period shall be promptly distributed, without interest, to the Limited Partners on a pro rata basis, as a return of capital, except that Investments using funds from Ohio Limited Partners must be completed within a three-month period or those funds must be returned to the Ohio Limited Partners. 11.6 No Distributions in Kind. Distributions in kind shall not be permitted except on dissolution and liquidation of the Partnerships assets and then only to a liquidating trust established for the purpose of liquidating the assets transferred to it and distributing the net cash proceeds of the liquidation in cash to the Partners in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. A-30 Table of Contents 11.7 Partnership Entitled to Withhold Taxes. The Partnership shall at all times be entitled to withhold or make payments to any governmental authority with respect to any federal, state, local or foreign tax liability of any Partner or former Partner arising as a result of the Partners participation in the Partnership. Each amount so withheld or paid shall be deemed to be a distributed to such Partner for all purposes of this Agreement. To the extent that the amount of withholdings or payments made with respect to any Partner exceeds the amount to which the Partner is then entitled as a distribution, the excess shall be treated as a demand loan, bearing interest at a rate equal to 12% per annum simple interest from the date of the payment or withholding until the excess is repaid to the Partnership either by deduction from any distributions subsequently payable to the Partner under this Agreement or earlier payment of the excess and interest by the Partner to the Partnership. The excess withholdings or payments, together with interest thereon, shall, in any case, be payable not less than 30 days after demand therefor by the General Partner. However, the General Partner shall demand payment only if it determines that the Partner is not likely to be entitled to distributions within 12 months from the date of the withholding or payment by the Partnership in an amount sufficient to pay the excess and interest. ARTICLE XII  WITHDRAWAL OF GENERAL PARTNER 12.1 Voluntary Withdrawal . The General Partner may not voluntarily withdraw as a General Partner from the Partnership unless: (i) the Limited Partners have received 60 days advance written notice of the General Partners intention to withdraw; (ii) the Partnership has received an opinion of Counsel to the effect that the withdrawal will not constitute a termination of the Partnership as a limited partnership under the Delaware Act or otherwise materially adversely affect the status of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes; and (iii) a Substitute General Partner has been selected, and the Substitute General Partner has: (A) consented to its admission as General Partner; (B) received the written Consent of a Majority Interest to its admission as General Partner; and (C) a Net Worth sufficient, in the opinion of Counsel, for the Partnership to continue to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and to satisfy the Net Worth requirements for sponsors under applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies of Administrators. 12.2 Involuntary Withdrawal . The General Partner shall be deemed to have involuntarily withdrawn as a General Partner from the Partnership on the removal of the General Partner pursuant to the Consent of the Majority Interest or on the occurrence of any other event that constitutes an event of withdrawal under the Delaware Act as then in effect. For purposes of this Section 12.2 and Article XVI, neither the General Partner nor any Affiliate of the General Partner may participate in any vote by the Limited Partners to involuntarily remove the General Partner. 12.3 Consequences of Withdrawal (a) Upon Withdrawal. On the withdrawal of the General Partner as such from the Partnership: (i) the Partnership shall pay to the withdrawn General Partner the fair market value of the Partnership Interest then held by the General Partner, calculated in the manner set forth in subsection (b), below, and payable as set forth in subsection (c), below; and (ii) an amount equal to the difference between any fees accrued but not yet paid to the General Partner, plus all other amounts due and owing to the General Partner by the Partnership, minus any amounts due and owing by the General Partner to the Partnership, which shall be payable in cash within 30 days of the date of withdrawal, by the debtor party to the creditor party. A-31 Table of Contents (b) Determination of Fair Market Value. For purposes of this Section 12.3, the fair market value of the withdrawn General Partners Partnership Interest shall be determined, in good faith, by the withdrawn General Partner and the Substitute General Partner, or, if they cannot agree, by arbitration in accordance with the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association. The expense of arbitration shall be borne equally by the withdrawn General Partner and the Partnership, provided, however, that each party shall bear its own attorneys fees. (c) Method of Payment. The method of payment to the General Partner on withdrawal, whether voluntary or involuntary, must be fair and must protect the solvency and liquidity of the Partnership. When the withdrawal is voluntary, the method of payment will be presumed to be fair if it provides for a non-interest-bearing, unsecured promissory note of the Partnership, with principal payable, if at all, from distributions that the withdrawn General Partner otherwise would have received under the Partnership Agreement had the General Partner not withdrawn. When the withdrawal is involuntary, unless otherwise agreed by the withdrawn General Partner and the Partnership, the method of payment shall be a promissory note providing for repayments of principal thereunder in 60 equal monthly installments, together with accrued but unpaid interest, bearing interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at the lesser of: (i) the rate of interest (inclusive of any points or other loan charges) that the Partnership would be required to pay to an unrelated bank or commercial lending institution for an unsecured, 60 month loan of like amount; or (ii) the Prime Rate of interest published in the Money Rates section of the Wall Street Journal, plus 4%. 12.4 Liability of Withdrawn General Partner . If the business of the Partnership is continued after withdrawal of the General Partner, the General Partner, or its estate, successors or legal representatives, shall remain liable for all obligations and liabilities incurred by it or by the Partnership while it was acting in the capacity of General Partner and for which it was liable as General Partner, but they shall be free of any obligation or liability incurred on account of or arising from the activities of the Partnership from and after the time the withdrawal became effective. 12.5 Notice of Withdrawal; Admission of Substitute General Partner; Dissolution if No Substitute General Partner Approved. If the General Partner voluntarily withdraws from the Partnership, the General Partner, or its estate, successors or legal representatives, shall deliver to the Limited Partners a Notice that includes the effective date of its withdrawal. Within 90 days following a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal, a Majority Interest may agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and elect, effective as of the date of the withdrawn General Partners withdrawal, a Substitute General Partner. The Substitute General Partner shall execute a counterpart of this Agreement. If this action is not taken within 90 days following the date of the General Partners withdrawal, then the Partnership shall dissolve. ARTICLE XIII  TRANSFER OF UNITS 13.1 Withdrawal of a Limited Partner . A Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership only by Assigning or having the Partnership Redeem all Units owned by the Limited Partner in accordance with this Article XIII. The withdrawal of a Limited Partner shall not dissolve or terminate the Partnership. If a Limited Partner withdraws because of death, legal incompetence, dissolution or other termination, the estate, legal representative or successor of the Limited Partner shall be deemed to be the Assignee of the Limited Partners Units and may become a Substitute Limited Partner on compliance with the provisions of Section 13.3. A-32 Table of Contents 13.2 Assignment (a) Assignment by a Limited Partner. Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c), below, and Section 13.3, any Limited Partner may Assign all or any portion of his Units to an Assignee if: (i) the Limited Partner and the Assignee each execute a written Assignment, which: (A) sets forth the terms of the Assignment; (B) in the case of Assignments other than by operation of law, states the intention of the Limited Partner that the Assignee shall become a Substitute Limited Partner and, in all cases, evidences the acceptance by the Assignee of all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and (C) includes a representation by both the Limited Partner and the Assignee that the Assignment was made in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, the minimum investment and investor suitability requirements as may then be applicable under state securities laws); and (ii) the Assignee pays to the Partnership an aggregate amount, not exceeding $150, for expenses reasonably incurred by the Partnership in connection with processing the Assignment. (b) General Partner Must Consent to the Withdrawal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the General Partner specifically Consents, no Units may be Assigned: (i) to a minor or incompetent (unless a guardian, custodian or conservator has been appointed to handle the affairs of that Person); (ii) to any Person if, in the opinion of Counsel, the Assignment would result in the termination of the Partnerships taxable year or its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, provided that the Partnership may permit the Assignment to become effective if and when, in the opinion of Counsel, the Assignment would no longer result in the termination of the Partnerships taxable year or its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes; (iii) to any Person if the Assignment, in the opinion of Counsel, would affect the Partnerships existence or qualification as a limited partnership under the Delaware Act or the applicable laws of any other jurisdiction in which the Partnership is then conducting business; (iv) to any Person not permitted, in the opinion of Counsel, to be an Assignee under applicable law, including, without limitation, applicable federal and state securities laws; (v) if the Assignment would result in the transfer of less than 25 Units (unless the Assignment includes all of the Units owned by the Limited Partner); (vi) if the Assignment would result in the retention by the Limited Partner of a portion of his Units representing less than the greater of 25 Units or the minimum number of units required to be purchased under the minimum investment standards applicable under state securities laws to applicable Limited Partners initial purchase of the Units; or (vii) if, in the opinion of Counsel, the effect of the Assignment would be to cause the equity participation in the Partnership by benefit plan investors (within the meaning of Department of Labor Reg. Section 2510.3-101(f)) and possibly other tax-exempt investors (as determined by the General Partner after consultation with Counsel) to equal or exceed 25% of the Partnerships total outstanding Units. Any attempt to make any Assignment of Units in violation of this Section 13.2(b) shall be without force or effect. (c) Publicly Traded Partnership Prohibition. The General Partner shall not permit any interest in a Unit to be Assigned (including Redemptions of Units under Section 13.5) on a secondary market or substantial equivalent thereof as within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.7704-1(c) (a Secondary Market). For purposes of this Section 13.2(c), any Assignment that fails to meet one or more of the secondary market safe- A-33 Table of Contents harbor provisions of Treas. Reg. Section 1.7704-1 or any substitute safe-harbor provisions that subsequently may be established by Treasury Regulations or published notices of the IRS, shall be treated as an Assignment on a Secondary Market under this Section 13.2(c). If the General Partner determines, pursuant to an opinion of Counsel, that an Assignment was or will be effected on a Secondary Market, the Partnership and the General Partner shall not recognize the Assignment and shall not admit the transferee as a Substitute Limited Partner, nor recognize any rights of the transferee in the Partnership, such as the right to receive distributions of Distributable Cash or any interest in Partnership capital or profits. Each Limited Partner agrees to provide to the General Partner all information with regard to any Assignment by the Limited Partner, whether proposed or purportedly completed, that the General Partner deems necessary in order to determine whether the Assignment by the Limited Partner occurred or will occur on a Secondary Market. (d) Effectiveness of Assignment. Assignments made in accordance with this Section 13.2 shall be considered effective on the last day of the month on which all of the conditions of this Section 13.2 have been satisfied. Distributions to the Assignee shall begin the month following effectiveness of the Assignment. 13.3 Substitution (a) Condition on Substitution. An Assignee of a Limited Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as a Substitute Limited Partner only if: (i) the General Partner has reasonably determined that all of the conditions specified in Section 13.2 have been satisfied and no adverse effect to the Partnership will result from the admission; and (ii) the Assignee has executed a transfer agreement and the other forms, including a power of attorney to the effect required by Article XVIII, as the General Partner reasonably may require to comply with this Article XIII. (b) Effect of Assignment Without Substitution. An Assignee of Units who does not become a Substitute Limited Partner in accordance with this Section 13.3 and who desires to make a further Assignment of his Units shall be subject to all of the provisions of Sections 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4 to the same extent and in the same manner as a Limited Partner desiring to make an Assignment of his Units. Failure or refusal of the General Partner to admit an Assignee as a Substitute Limited Partner, if the Assignment otherwise complies with Section 13.2, and subsection (c) thereof in particular, shall not affect the right of the Assignee to receive Distributable Cash and the share of Income or Loss to which his predecessor in interest would have been entitled in accordance with Article XI and Article XIV. (c) Amendment of Records. The Partnership shall amend its records at least once each calendar quarter, to the extent necessary, to effect the substitution of Substitute Limited Partners. 13.4 Status of an Assigning Limited Partner . If a Limited Partner Assigns all of his Units to an Assignee who becomes a Substitute Limited Partner, the assignor Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner in the Partnership and shall no longer have any of the rights or privileges of a Limited Partner. 13.5 Limited Right of Presentment for Redemption of Units (a) Limited Right to Redeem Units. Subject to the limitations set forth below, beginning with the admission of a Limited Partner to the Partnership, each Limited Partner (other than the General Partner or its Affiliates if they own Units) may request that the Partnership Redeem, for cash, up to 100% of the Limited Partners Units. This right of presentment shall be subject to the limitations set forth below. (i) The Partnership shall never be required to Redeem any Units of any Limited Partner and shall do so only with the prior Consent of the General Partner, which is in the sole discretion of the General Partner. In this regard, the General Partner may take into consideration the time of year during which a Redemption request is made, and the effect making a Redemption would have on the Partnerships compliance with the 2% limitation described in clause (ii), below. A-34 Table of Contents (ii) The Partnership shall not, in any calendar year, Redeem Units that, in the aggregate with all Units otherwise transferred in that calendar year, would exceed 2% of the Partnerships total capital or profits interests as of the last day of that year. (iii) No Reserves shall be established by the Partnership for the Redemption of Units. The availability of funds for the Redemption of any Unit shall be subject to the availability of sufficient Cash Flow. Furthermore, Units may be Redeemed only if the Redemption would not impair the capital or the Operations of the Partnership and would not result in the termination under the Code of the Partnerships taxable year or its federal income tax status as a partnership, all as determined in the sole discretion of the General Partner. (iv) The Partnership may charge a reasonable administrative fee as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. (b) Applicable Redemption Price. The Redemption price for a Limited Partners Units (the Applicable Redemption Price) will depend on when the Limited Partner presents his Units for Redemption and shall be determined as set forth below. If a Limited Partner presents his Units for Redemption: (i) during the Offering Period and Operating Period, the Redemption price will equal not less than $850.00 per Unit, less 100% of previous distributions paid to the Limited Partner per Unit; or (ii) during the Liquidation Period, the Redemption price will equal the equity per Unit as set forth on the Partnerships balance sheet in its most recent periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the Redemption request, less 100% of any distributions paid to the Limited Partner per Unit since the date of the balance sheet. (c) Procedure for Presentment. A Limited Partner desiring to have a portion or all of his Units Redeemed shall submit a written request to the General Partner on a form approved by the General Partner and duly signed by all owners on the books of the Partnership of the Units to be Redeemed. Redemption requests shall be deemed given on the earlier of the date they are: (i) personally delivered with receipt acknowledged; or (ii) mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the General Partners address set forth in this Agreement. Requests arising from death, major medical expense and family emergency related to disability or a material loss of family income, collectively Hardship Redemptions, shall be treated as having been received at 12:01 A.M. EST on the day of receipt and all other Redemption requests shall be deemed received with the start of the business day during which received. (d) Priority of Redemption Requests. If the General Partner receives requests for the Partnership to redeem more Units than there are funds sufficient to redeem, the General Partner shall use its reasonable efforts to honor requests for Redemptions of Units with the same request date first as to Hardship Redemptions, second so as to provide liquidity for IRAs or Qualified Plans to meet required distributions and finally as to all other Redemption requests. (e) Notice and Closing of Redemption of Units. Redemption requests shall be accepted or rejected quarterly following the date on which the General Partner receives a written request from any Limited Partner to Redeem the Limited Partners Units, and the General Partner shall deliver a written notice to the Limited Partner (the Notice): (i) stating the number, if any, of the Units to be Redeemed; and (ii) if appropriate: (A) stating the date of the Redemption of the Units, which shall be a date within 30 days following the date of the Notice; (B) stating the Applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Units to be Redeemed; and A-35 Table of Contents (C) advising the Limited Partner that not less than 10 days before the Redemption date stated in the Notice (the Delivery Date) the Limited Partner must duly execute and deliver to the Partnership all transfer instruments and other documents requested by the Partnership to evidence the Redemption of the Units. In the General Partners discretion, these transfer instruments and documents may be prepared by the Partnership for execution by the Limited Partner and enclosed with the Notice. On or before the Redemption date stated in the Notice, the Partnership shall pay the Applicable Redemption Price to the Limited Partner for each Unit Redeemed if: (i) all of the Limited Partners transfer instruments and other documents requested by the Partnership are duly executed and returned to the Partnership no later than the Delivery Date stated in the Notice; and (ii) the transfer instruments and other documents are in good order and acceptable to the General Partner, in its sole discretion. (f) Effect of Redemption. If all of the Units owned by a Limited Partner are Redeemed by the Partnership, then the Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner in the Partnership and shall no longer have any of the rights or privileges of a Limited Partner in the Partnership.

Notwithstanding the dissolution of the Partnership as provided above, its business and the affairs of the Partners, as such, shall continue to be governed by this Agreement until the Partnership is terminated. 14.2(b). Liquidation. On dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner (or any other Person effecting the winding-up) shall liquidate the assets of the Partnership and apply and distribute the proceeds as set forth in Section 14.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XIV, if the General Partner (or any other Person effecting the winding-up) determines that an immediate sale of part or all of the Partnership assets would cause undue loss to the Partners, the General Partner (or any other Person effecting the winding-up), in order to avoid the loss, may, after having notified all of the Limited Partners, to A-36 Table of Contents the extent not then prohibited by law, defer liquidation of, and withhold from distribution for a reasonable time, any assets of the Partnership except those necessary to satisfy the Partnerships debts and obligations. 14.2(c). Procedures on Liquidation. In connection with the dissolution of the Partnership: (i) all Income or Loss or items thereof, and all amounts required to be specially allocated for the period before final termination, shall be allocated among the Capital Accounts of the Partners in accordance with Article XI; (ii) if after all requirements of clause (i) of this Section 14.2(c) have been accomplished, the General Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account, then within 30 days the General Partner shall contribute the amount of the deficit balance to the Partnership as a Capital Contribution, provided that for this purpose, any payments made by the General Partner as co-signatory or guarantor of any Indebtedness of the Partnership that has not yet been reimbursed to the General Partner by the Partnership at the time of dissolution of the Partnership, and any amounts due and unpaid to the General Partner with respect to any Partnership Loans at the time of dissolution, shall be deemed to be Capital Contributions by the General Partner to the Partnership and any obligation of the Partnership to reimburse or repay those amounts to the General Partner shall then cease; (iii) the proceeds from Sales or other dispositions of all other assets of the Partnership shall be applied and distributed in liquidation of the Partnership as provided in Section 14.3; and (iv) the General Partner (or any other Person effecting the winding-up) shall file all certificates and other documents as may be required by the Delaware Act, the Code and any other applicable laws to terminate the Partnership. 14.2(d). Fees for Winding-Up. Whether the winding-up of the Partnership is effected by the General Partner or any other Person (whether selected by the Majority Interest or as required by law), either the General Partner or the other Person, as the case may be, shall be compensated for its services in connection therewith in an amount not in excess of the amount customarily paid to non-affiliated third-parties rendering similar services in respect of similar entities in the same geographic location. 14.3 Application of Liquidation Proceeds On Dissolution.

A-37 Table of Contents 14.4 No Recourse Against Other Partners . Each Limited Partner shall look solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of, and any return on, the Limited Partners Capital Contribution (whether before or after a Dissolution Event). If, after the complete payment and discharge of all debts, liabilities and other obligations of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership are insufficient to provide the return of, or a return on, the Capital Contribution of any Limited Partner, the Limited Partner shall have no recourse against any other Limited Partner, the Partnership or the General Partner, except to the extent that the General Partner is obligated to make an additional Capital Contribution to the Partnership under Section 14.2.

The funds of the Partnership shall not be commingled with the funds of any other Person. 15.2 Maintenance of and Access to Basic Partnership Documents 15.2(a). Maintenance of Documents. The General Partner shall maintain at the General Partners principal office, on behalf of the Partnership, the following documents: (i) the Participant List; (ii) a copy of the certificate of limited partnership and all amendments thereto, together with executed copies of any powers of attorney under which the certificate or any amendment thereto has been executed; (iii) copies of this Agreement and any amendments hereto; (iv) copies of the audited financial statements of the Partnership for the three most recently completed Fiscal Years, including, in each case, the balance sheet and related statements of operations, cash flows and changes in Partners equity at or for those Fiscal Years, together with the reports of the Partnerships independent auditors with respect thereto; (v) copies of the Partnerships federal, state and local income tax returns and reports, if any, for its three most recently completed Fiscal Years; (vi) records as required by applicable tax authorities, including those specifically required to be maintained by reportable transactions, if so required of the Partnership; and (vii) investor suitability records for Units sold for a period of no less than six years. 15.2(b). Access to Records. Each Limited Partner and his designated representative shall be given access to the records specified in Section 15.2(a)(i) through (vi) and any other records of the Partnership that relate to the business affairs and financial condition of the Partnership, other than records under Section 15.2(a)(vii) relating to other Limited Partners, and may inspect the same and make copies of the same during normal business hours, subject to the following: (i) a reasonable copying charge; (ii) providing reasonable advance written notice to the General Partner that states the date and time of the intended visit and identifies with reasonable specificity the documents that the Limited Partner or his representative wishes to examine or copy; and (iii) in the case of copying the Participant List, compliance with Section 15.2(c). 15.2(c).

General Partners Refusal to Provide Participant List. If the General Partner refuses or neglects to: (i) permit a Limited Partner or his representative to examine the Participant List at the General Partners principal office during normal business hours and with reasonable notice to the General Partner; or (ii) mail a copy of the Participant List to the Limited Partner or his representative as required by Section 15.2(c); the General Partner shall be liable to the Limited Partner who requested the Participant List for the costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the Limited Partner to compel production of the Participant List, and for the actual damages (if any) suffered by the Limited Partner by reason of the General Partners refusal or neglect. It shall be a defense that the requesting Limited Partner failed or refused to provide the General Partner with the certification called for in the next sentence or that the actual purpose and reason for a request to inspect or copy the Participant List is to secure the Participant List or other information for the purpose of the sale, reproduction or other use thereof for a commercial purpose other than in the interest of the Limited Partner relative to the affairs of the Partnership. The General Partner shall require a Limited Partner requesting the Participant List to certify that the Participant List is not being requested for the purpose of the sale, reproduction or other use thereof for a commercial purpose unrelated to the Limited Partners interest in the Partnership or for any unlawful purpose.

The additional costs of the special review required by this clause shall be itemized by the Accountants on a Program by Program basis and shall be reimbursed to the General Partner by the Partnership only to the extent that the reimbursement, when added to the cost for administrative services rendered, does not exceed the amount the Partnership would be required to pay independent third-parties for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location; and (v) a special report containing the information required by Section 15.5(a)(iii). 15.5(c). Reports to State Securities Law Administrators. The General Partner shall submit to all state securities law Administrators, including Arizona, California and Ohio, if applicable, any information which the Administrator requires, including, but not limited to: (i) reports and statements required by this Agreement to be distributed to Limited Partners; or (ii) reports required to be filed with the Administrator by state securities laws, regulations or policies. 15.6 Tax Returns and Tax Information.

All other elections, including but not limited to the adoption of accelerated depreciation and cost recovery methods, required or permitted to be made by the Partnership under the Code shall be made by the General Partner in a manner that will, in the opinion of the General Partner (as advised by Counsel or the Accountants as the General Partner deems necessary), be most advantageous to the Limited Partners as a group. The Partnership shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulations, elect to treat as an expense for federal income tax purposes all amounts incurred by it for state and local taxes, interest and other charges that may, in accordance with applicable law and regulations, be considered to be expenses.

Undertakings The registrant hereby undertakes: (a) (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) ( § 230.424(b ) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. II-2 Table of Contents (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the registrant hereby undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (§230.424 of this chapter); (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. (5) That all such post-effective amendments will comply with the applicable forms, rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission in effect at the time such post-effective amendments are filed. (b) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (c) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. The registrant undertakes to send to each limited partners at least on an annual basis a detailed statement of any transactions with the general partner or its affiliates, and of fees, commissions, compensation and other benefits paid, or accrued to the general partner or its affiliates for the fiscal year completed, showing the amount paid or accrued to each recipient and the services performed.
