The notes accrue interest at the rate of 9.75% per annum. The notes will mature on October 15, 2019. Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company LLC (EFIH) and EFIH Finance Inc. (EFIH Finance and, together with EFIH, the Issuer) may redeem any of the notes beginning on October 15, 2014 at the redemption prices set forth in this prospectus. The Issuer may also redeem any of the notes at any time prior to October 15, 2014 at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium. In addition, before October 15, 2012, the Issuer may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes using the proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this prospectus. The notes are secured, equally and ratably with EFIHs guarantee of certain outstanding indebtedness of its parent company, Energy Future Holdings Corp. (EFH Corp.), by the pledge of all membership interests and other investments EFIH owns or holds in Oncor Electric Delivery Holdings Company LLC (Oncor Holdings) or any of Oncor Holdings subsidiaries (such membership interests and other investments, the Collateral). The notes are senior obligations of the Issuer and rank equally in right of payment with all senior indebtedness of the Issuer. The notes will be effectively senior to all unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and will be effectively subordinated to any indebtedness of the Issuer secured by assets of the Issuer other than the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Furthermore, as of the date of this prospectus, the notes are not guaranteed.

Investment funds associated with or designated by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), TPG Capital, L.P. (TPG) and the Market Maker (together with KKR and TPG, the Sponsor Group), and certain other co-investors own EFH Corp. through Texas Energy Future Holdings Limited Partnership (Texas Holdings), with the Sponsor Group controlling Texas Holdings general partner, Texas Energy Future Capital Holdings LLC (the General Partner). Our Businesses EFIH is a holding company for its subsidiaries, including Oncor Holdings and its subsidiary, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (Oncor), which are principally engaged in providing electricity delivery services to retail electric providers, including subsidiaries of TCEH, that sell power in the north-central, eastern and western parts of Texas. Oncor is engaged in regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations in Texas that are primarily regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the PUCT). Oncor provides both distribution services to retail electric providers that sell electricity to consumers and transmission services to other electricity distribution companies, cooperatives and municipalities. Oncor operates the largest transmission and distribution system in Texas, delivering electricity to approximately three million homes and businesses and operating more than 117,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines. A significant portion of Oncors revenues represent fees for delivery services provided to TCEH. Distribution revenues from TCEH represented 38% and 39% of Oncors total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. EFH Corp. and Oncor have implemented certain structural and operational ring-fencing measures based on commitments made by Texas Holdings and Oncor to the PUCT that are intended to enhance the credit quality of Oncor Holdings and Oncor. These measures serve to mitigate Oncors and Oncor Holdings credit exposure to Texas Holdings and its subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Subsidiaries) (collectively, the Texas Holdings Group) and to reduce the risk that the assets and liabilities of Oncor or Oncor Holdings would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of the Texas Holdings Group in the event of a bankruptcy of one or more of those entities. See Note 1 to Financial Statements included in our 2009 Form 10-K for a description of the material features of these ring-fencing measures. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately 3,800 full-time employees, including approximately 690 employees under collective bargaining agreements. 1 Table of Contents Recent Developments In January 2010, EFH Corp. issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, which are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by EFIH. The EFH Corp. 2020 Notes will mature on January 15, 2020. Interest on the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes is payable in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year at a fixed rate of 10.000% per annum with the first interest payment due on July 15, 2010. The EFH Corp. 2020 Notes have the same guarantees and collateral and substantially the same other terms and conditions as the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes as described in Note 11 to Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K. In March 2010, EFH Corp. issued in a private exchange $34 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes to an existing holder (the Holder) of EFH Corp.s 11.250%/12.000% Senior Toggle Notes due 2017 and TCEHs and TCEH Finance, Inc.s 10.50%/11.25% Senior Toggle Notes due 2016. In exchange for the 2020 Notes, the Holder surrendered, transferred and delivered to EFH Corp. $20 million aggregate principal amount of EFH Corp.s 11.250%/12.000% Senior Toggle Notes due 2017 and $27 million aggregate principal amount of TCEHs and TCEH Finance, Inc.s 10.50%/11.25% Senior Toggle Notes due 2016. Following the exchange transaction, the EFH Corp. 11.250%/12.000% Senior Toggle Notes due 2017 acquired by EFH Corp. were retired. On April 1, 2010, Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (a credit rating agency) (Fitch), downgraded its issuer default ratings of EFH Corp., EFIH, EFCH and TCEH one notch to B- from B and maintained a negative outlook, citing its diminished expectations of the cash flow generation capability of EFH Corp.s competitive businesses in the face of very high debt leverage. In addition, Fitch downgraded the TCEH senior secured credit facilities two notches to B+ from BB and the TCEH 2015/2016 Notes one notch to B- from B. Fitch affirmed its ratings and stable outlook for Oncor. A credit rating reflects only the view of a rating agency, and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Credit ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.

Certain of the terms and conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. The Description of the Notes section of this prospectus contains more detailed descriptions of the terms and conditions of the notes and the related indenture. Issuer Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company LLC and EFIH Finance Inc. Securities Offered $141,083,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2019. Maturity Date October 15, 2019. Interest Rate The notes accrue interest at the rate of 9.75% per annum. Interest Payment Dates Interest on the notes is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2010. Ranking The notes are:  senior obligations of the Issuer and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer (including EFIHs guarantees of the EFH Corp. 2017 Notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes);  secured by the pledge of any investments EFIH owns in Oncor Holdings or any of its subsidiaries, which on the date of this prospectus consist of all of the membership interests EFIH owns in Oncor Holdings;  effectively senior to all unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and any indebtedness secured by the Collateral on a subordinated basis, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;  effectively subordinated to any indebtedness of the Issuer secured by assets of the Issuer other than the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness;  structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of EFIHs subsidiaries (other than EFIH Finance), including the Oncor Subsidiaries, any of EFIHs future foreign subsidiaries and any other unrestricted subsidiaries of EFIH; and  senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer. As of December 31, 2009, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the issuance of the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, (1) the Issuer would not have had any senior indebtedness other than the notes and the guarantees by EFIH of the EFH Corp. 2017 Notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes and (2) the notes would have been structurally subordinated to approximately $5,741 billion principal amount of indebtedness (includes long-term debt, including amounts due currently, and short-term borrowings) of the Issuers subsidiaries (other than EFIH Finance), including all of the Oncor Subsidiaries indebtedness. As of December 31, 2009, Oncor had approximately $1.262 billion of additional available capacity under its revolving credit facility (excluding $122 million of undrawn commitments from a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. that has filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended). 3 Table of Contents See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessIf a court were to find that EFIH were insolvent before or after giving effect to the issuance of the notes in the exchange offers and did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the issuance of the notes or the pledge of the Collateral, the court may void all or a portion of the obligations represented by the notes or the pledge of the Collateral by EFIH as a fraudulent conveyance. Guarantees The notes are not guaranteed. Security The notes are secured, equally and ratably with EFIHs guarantees of the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, by EFIHs pledge of 100% of the membership interests and other investments it owns or holds in Oncor Holdings. As of the date of this prospectus, $115 million of EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and $534 million of EFH Corp. 2020 Notes were outstanding. See Description of the NotesSecurity for the Notes. See also Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessThe indenture governing the notes may not protect holders from all actions that EFH Corp., EFIH or the Oncor Subsidiaries may take that would reduce your interest in the Collateral or that may reduce the value of the Collateral, including sales or exchanges of the Collateral or the assets of the Oncor Subsidiaries for other assets or investments. Optional Redemption The Issuer may redeem any of the notes on and after October 15, 2014 at the redemption prices set forth in this prospectus. The Issuer may also redeem any of the notes at any time prior to October 15, 2014 at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest and a make-whole premium. In addition, before October 15, 2012, the Issuer may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes, using the proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this prospectus. See Description of the NotesOptional Redemption. Change of Control Offer Upon the occurrence of certain transactions meeting the definition of change of control, holders of the notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase some or all of the notes at 101% of their face amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. This right is subject to important limitations. For example, this right will not apply to a transaction that would otherwise be a change of control if the transaction meets certain requirements. See Description of the NotesRepurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control and the definition of Change of Control under Description of the Notes. 4 Table of Contents The Issuer may not be able to pay holders the required price for notes they present to it at the time of a change of control, because the Issuer may not have enough funds at that time or the terms of the Issuers other indebtedness or any of its subsidiaries indebtedness, including Oncors revolving credit facility, may prevent the Issuer from making such payment or receiving funds from its subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to fund such payment. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessThe Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control, Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessWe may transfer or dispose of our interests in Oncor Holdings to a third party in a manner that would result in such third party becoming the obligor under the notes, without EFIH being required to offer to repurchase such notes. The risks of an investment in the notes may increase further following such a transaction. Important Covenants The indenture governing the notes contains covenants limiting EFIHs ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to:  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of EFIHs capital stock or make other restricted payments;  make investments (including investments in Oncor);  incur additional debt or issue some types of preferred shares;  create liens on assets to secure debt;  sell assets;  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets in certain circumstances;  enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; and  designate its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. For example, the sale of all of the Oncor business (as defined under Permitted Asset Transfer under Description of the Notes) will not be considered the sale of all or substantially all of EFIHs assets under the indenture so long as certain conditions are satisfied, including the condition that the transferee assumes the obligations under the notes. Certain other transactions (including certain intercompany transactions) involving the Oncor business will also not be considered the sale of all or substantially all of EFIHs assets. Additionally, up to an aggregate of $4.0 billion of indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the Collateral, including the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, may be incurred under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, none of EFIHs subsidiaries (other than EFIH Finance, which has no assets) are restricted subsidiaries subject to the covenants referenced above. Oncor Holdings, the immediate parent of Oncor, and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture and, accordingly, are not subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the indenture. 5 Table of Contents No Active Trading Market We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of markets that may develop for the notes, your ability to sell the notes or the price at which you would be able to sell the notes. The Market Maker has advised us that it intends to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, it is not obligated to do so, and it may discontinue its market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, it may be restricted in its market-making activities. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessYour ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the notes. Listing The notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TXUI19. Use of Proceeds This prospectus may be delivered in connection with the resale of notes by the Market Maker and the affiliates of the Market Maker in market-making transactions in the notes in the secondary market. We will not receive any of the proceeds from such resales. See Use of Proceeds. Risk Factors In addition to the other information included in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus, you should carefully consider the information set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 22, as well as those contained in our 2009 Form 10-K, which is incorporated into this prospectus by reference, before deciding whether or not to invest in the notes. 6 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and the risk factors incorporated into this prospectus by reference to our 2009 Form 10-K, as well as the other information contained in and incorporated by reference into this prospectus before deciding to invest in the notes. The selected risks described below and the risks that are incorporated into this prospectus by reference to our 2009 Form 10-K are not our only risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any of the following risks or any of the risks described in our 2009 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow. In such a case, the trading price of the notes could decline, or we may not be able to make payments of interest and principal on the notes, and you may lose all or part of your original investment. Risks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial Indebtedness Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy and prevent us from meeting obligations under the various debt agreements governing our indebtedness. We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2009, our consolidated principal amount of debt (short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including amounts due currently and the portion of the debt of EFH Corp. that is guaranteed by EFIH and pushed down to EFIH in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)) totaled $8.25 billion (see Notes 10 and 11 to Financial Statements included in our 2009 Form 10-K). Our substantial leverage could have important consequences, including:  making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;  requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to make capital expenditures and take advantage of future business opportunities and execute our strategy;  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;  limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance existing debt;  placing us at a disadvantage compared to competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that we cannot due to our substantial leverage; and  limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions. Despite our current high indebtedness level, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with the notes and our other substantial indebtedness. We may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our debt agreements and certain debt agreements of EFH Corp. contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The indenture governing the notes allows EFIH to incur up to an aggregate of $4.0 billion of debt, including the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, which would be secured on a parity lien basis by the Collateral, and a substantial amount of additional indebtedness, which additional indebtedness may be secured by a junior-priority security interest in the Collateral or by assets of EFIH other than the Collateral. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would intensify. See Description of the Notes. 7 Table of Contents The indenture governing the notes and certain of the debt agreements of EFH Corp. contain restrictions that limit flexibility in operating our businesses. The indenture governing the notes and certain debt agreements of EFH Corp. contain covenants and other restrictions that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions and may adversely affect our ability to operate our businesses. These covenants and other restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred shares;  pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments;  make investments;  sell or transfer assets;  create liens;  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;  enter into transactions with our affiliates; and  repay, repurchase or modify certain subordinated and other material debt. There are a number of important limitations and exceptions to these covenants and other restrictions. See Description of the Notes for a description of these covenants and other restrictions. In addition, EFH Corp. and Oncor have implemented a number of ring-fencing measures to enhance the credit quality of Oncor, its immediate parent, Oncor Holdings, and Oncor Holdings other subsidiaries. Those measures include, among other things:  Oncor being treated as an unrestricted subsidiary with respect to EFIHs indebtedness, including the notes;  Oncor not being restricted from incurring its own indebtedness;  Oncor not guaranteeing or pledging any of its assets to secure the indebtedness of any member of the Texas Holdings Group; and  restrictions on dividends, and the right of the independent members of Oncors board of directors and the primary minority interest member of Oncor to block the payment of dividends. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes. If cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our and our subsidiaries debt service obligations, we or our subsidiaries could face substantial liquidity problems and might be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful or adequate for us and our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations then due. Additionally, our and our subsidiaries debt agreements, including the indenture governing the notes, and certain debt agreements of EFH Corp. limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of assets or operations. As a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations. 8 Table of Contents If we or any of our subsidiaries default on obligations to pay indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the notes. Any default under our or our subsidiaries debt agreements that is not waived by the required lenders or noteholders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes, which could substantially decrease the market price of the notes. If our subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flows and we are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we or our subsidiaries otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including any financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our or their indebtedness, we or they could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and/or the lenders could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and, in the case of the holders of the notes, institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency. If the operating performance of our subsidiaries declines, we or certain of our subsidiaries may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders or noteholders to avoid being in default. If our subsidiaries seek a waiver, they may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, such subsidiaries would be in default under the instrument governing that indebtedness, the lenders could exercise their rights, and such subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency. There are no guarantors of the notes. As a result, the notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of EFIHs subsidiaries (other than EFIH Finance) and will have no claim on the assets of EFH Corp. or its subsidiaries (other than the Issuer). The notes are not guaranteed. EFIH is a holding company, does not have any operations and generally relies on distributions from its subsidiaries to fund its obligations. However, EFIHs historical consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference into this prospectus reflect the results of operations and assets, among other things, of all of EFIHs subsidiaries. EFIHs subsidiaries generated all of its consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, and as of December 31, 2009, EFIHs subsidiaries held substantially all of EFIHs consolidated total assets. EFIHs subsidiaries (including the Oncor Subsidiaries) and EFH Corp. and its other subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make any funds available therefore, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. The notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of all of EFIHs subsidiaries (including the Oncor Subsidiaries), other than EFIH Finance, and holders of the notes will have no claim on the assets of EFH Corp., Energy Future Competitive Holdings Company (EFCH) and the subsidiaries of EFCH, including TCEH. The claims of creditors of each of EFIHs subsidiaries, including trade creditors, have priority as to the assets of these subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency of any of these subsidiaries, these subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to EFIH. The Issuers ability to obtain funds from TCEH (via EFH Corp.) to pay principal, premium and interest on the notes will be limited in some circumstances. Pursuant to TCEHs senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the TCEH 2015/2016 Notes, as long as TCEH is a subsidiary of EFH Corp., TCEH may provide EFH Corp. with intercompany loans on arms length terms, in an unlimited amount, to allow EFH Corp. to pay principal, premium and interest on the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and certain of the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes. However, the indenture governing the TCEH 2015/2016 Notes limits TCEHs ability to provide such loans for payment of principal, premium and interest on indebtedness of EFH Corp.s subsidiaries, including the notes. The indenture governing the notes does not limit or restrict the activities of the Oncor Subsidiaries. The Oncor Subsidiaries are not Restricted Subsidiaries under the indenture governing the notes (except under certain circumstances, such as in connection with the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio or consolidated leverage ratio for purposes of making certain restricted payments; see Description of the Notes). As of the date of this prospectus, EFIHs subsidiaries (other than EFIH Finance) consist only of the Oncor Subsidiaries, all of which are unrestricted subsidiaries of EFIH. Accordingly, none of EFIHs subsidiaries (other than EFIH Finance) are subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the notes, described under Description of the Notes, and none of EFIHs subsidiaries guarantee the notes. 9 Table of Contents Because the Oncor Subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture governing the notes and therefore are not subject to any of the restrictive covenants therein, the indenture does not serve to limit or restrict the ability of Oncor Holdings or its subsidiaries to take any actions or enter into any transactions that would impair their ability to dividend funds to EFIH to service the notes and other debt of EFIH, or that would negatively affect the value of EFIHs equity interests in Oncor Holdings that are pledged as Collateral for the notes, such as incurring debt, selling or transferring all or a portion of the assets of Oncor Holdings or its subsidiaries, entering into joint ventures, dividending out assets or engaging in speculative investments. Certain actions that would negatively affect the value of the Collateral may increase the ability of EFIH to make restricted payments under the terms of the indenture governing the notes. EFIH has a very limited ability to control activities at Oncor due to structural and operational ring-fencing measures. EFIH depends upon Oncor for a significant amount of its cash flows and ability to pay its obligations. However, EFIH has a very limited ability to control the activities of Oncor. As part of the ring-fencing measures related to Oncor implemented by EFH Corp. and Oncor, a majority of the members of Oncors board of directors are required to meet the New York Stock Exchange requirements for independence in all material respects, and the unanimous consent of such directors is required for Oncor to take certain actions. In addition, any new independent directors are required to be appointed by the nominating committee of Oncor Holdings board of directors, a majority of whose members are independent directors. No member of EFH Corp.s or EFIHs management is a member of Oncors board of directors. EFIH has a very limited ability to control the activities of Oncor. Under Oncor Holdings and Oncors organizational documents, EFIH has the right, indirectly, to consent to new issuances of equity securities by Oncor, material transactions with third parties involving Oncor outside of the ordinary course of business, actions that cause Oncors assets to increase the level of jurisdiction of the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), any changes to the state of formation of Oncor, material changes to accounting methods not required by GAAP, and actions that fail to enforce certain tax sharing obligations between Oncor and EFH Corp. In addition, there are restrictions on Oncors ability to make distributions to its members, including indirectly to EFIH. The notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the notes. The Collateral securing the notes includes only EFIHs membership interests and other investments that EFIH owns or holds in the Oncor Subsidiaries (which as of the date of this prospectus consists of 100% of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings), but does not include any assets of Oncor Holdings or its subsidiaries. Oncor Holdings owns approximately 80% of Oncor. No appraisals of any of the Collateral securing the notes have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer. The fair market value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure. The fair market value of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among other things, the financial results and prospects of the Oncor Subsidiaries and its ability to implement its business strategy, Oncors capital structure and the amount of its other existing indebtedness (as to which EFIH has no control), applicable regulatory approvals that may be required to foreclose on the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and subsequently dispose of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings, the ability to sell the membership interests of Oncor Holdings in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. Furthermore, upon a foreclosure in the Collateral, holders may be limited in their ability to obtain the best price for the Collateral if they are unable to exercise a drag-along right to force Texas Transmission Investment LLC (Texas Transmission), Oncors primary minority interest owner, to sell its membership interests pursuant to the terms of the investor rights agreement, dated November 5, 2007, among EFH Corp., Oncor Holdings, Oncor and Texas Transmission (the Investor Rights Agreement). In addition, a court could limit recoverability if it were to apply non-New York law to a proceeding and deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of public policy. The amount to be received upon a sale of any Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, general, market and economic conditions and the timing and the manner of the sale. 10 Table of Contents EFIHs guarantees of the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes are also secured by the Collateral, equally and ratably with the notes. In the event that a bankruptcy or similar proceeding is commenced by or against the Issuer, if at the time of the filing the value of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and other Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, interest may cease to accrue on the notes thereafter. If at the time of the filing the value of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and other Collateral is greater than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, interest may nevertheless cease to accrue at a subsequent time if at such time the value ceases to be in excess of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest. It is possible, given the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, even if at the time of the filing the value of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and other Collateral is greater than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes on the date of filing, claims on the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and other Collateral for interest accruing from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed might not be allowed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the proceeds from any sale of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and other Collateral may not be sufficient to pay the obligations due under the notes. To the extent that the claims of the holders of the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes exceed the value of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and other Collateral, those excess claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of EFIHs then outstanding senior debt. As a result, if the value of the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and other Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. The security interest granted in favor of the collateral trustee is subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral trustee may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract, and we cannot assure you that the collateral trustee will be able to obtain any such consent. The consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on any particular assets. Accordingly, the collateral trustee may not have the ability to foreclose upon such assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Regulatory approvals may be required in order to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and to dispose of an interest in, or operational control of, the Collateral that secures the notes. The Collateral securing the notes includes all of EFIHs membership interests and other investments that EFIH owns or holds in the Oncor Subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), Texas Utilities Code §§39.262(l) and 39.915, an electric utility must obtain prior PUCT approval of any change in majority ownership, controlling ownership or operational control of Oncor. As a result, prior to any foreclosure on the membership interests of Oncor Holdings, approval of the PUCT may be required for a change in ownership or control of Oncor Holdings. Pursuant to PURA §§39.262(m) and 39.915(b), the PUCT will approve such a transfer if it finds that the transaction is in the public interest. In making its determination, these sections of PURA provide that the PUCT will consider whether the transaction will adversely affect the reliability of service, availability of service or cost of service of Oncor. Therefore, in connection with any action taken to enforce the security against the Collateral, such approval may not be granted and, if it were to be granted, it is not known how long it would take to obtain such approval. Even if the approval were granted to foreclose on the Collateral, then additional prior PUCT approval may also be required for any subsequent change in majority ownership, controlling ownership or operational control in the membership interests of Oncor Holdings. Additionally, Texas Holdings has committed to hold a majority ownership interest in Oncor through October 10, 2012. This commitment is incorporated in the Order on Rehearing in PUCT Docket No. 34077. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, any transfer of the equity interests in Oncor Holdings to a third party, including as a result of any enforcement of the lien on the Collateral securing the notes and EFIHs guarantees of the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, may be limited and give rise to a tag-along right of Texas Transmission, the primary minority interest investor in Oncor, to participate in that transfer on a pro rata basis, which may hinder the enforcement of the lien on the Collateral in a timely manner, if at all. 11 Table of Contents In the event of the Issuers bankruptcy, the ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon the Collateral securing the notes will be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations. The right of the trustee for the notes to repossess and dispose of the Collateral, which secures the notes and EFIHs guarantees of the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against the Issuer. This could be true even if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced after the trustee for the notes has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under bankruptcy law, a secured creditor, such as the trustee for the notes, is prohibited from repossessing collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of collateral repossessed from a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use any such collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of such collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given adequate protection. The meaning of the term adequate protection varies according to circumstances, but in general the doctrine of adequate protection requires a debtor to protect the value of a secured creditors interest in the collateral, through cash payments, the granting of an additional security interest or otherwise. It is impossible to predict whether or when payments in respect of the notes might be made following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the trustee would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of adequate protection. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes, the holders of the notes would have unsecured deficiency claims as to the difference. Federal bankruptcy laws do not generally permit the payment of interest, costs, or attorneys fees for unsecured claims during the debtors bankruptcy case. Under the indenture governing the notes, holders of the notes agree to not file a bankruptcy proceeding against Oncor Holdings or any of its subsidiaries. By accepting any notes, holders of the notes acknowledge and agree that they will not (i) initiate any legal proceeding to procure the appointment of an administrative receiver or (ii) institute any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, winding up, liquidation, or any like proceeding under applicable law, against Oncor Holdings, Oncor or any of their subsidiaries, or against any of the assets of Oncor Holdings, Oncor or any of their subsidiaries. Such holders further acknowledge and agree that each of Oncor Holdings, Oncor and any of their subsidiaries is a third party beneficiary of the foregoing covenant and have the right to specifically enforce such covenant in any proceeding at law or in equity. In the event that the Issuer becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the notes will only have a claim for repayment of their notes against the Issuers assets, including the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and any other Collateral. Holders of the notes will not benefit from a guarantee of EFH Corp. or any of its other subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event that the Issuer becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, holders of notes will only have a claim against the Issuers assets, including the membership interests of Oncor Holdings and any other Collateral, to satisfy any outstanding principal, premium and interest on the notes, and will have no claim against the assets of EFH Corp. or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Issuer), including EFCH and TCEH, or against the assets of Oncor. The value of the Collateral may be diluted if we issue additional debt that is secured equally and ratably by the same Collateral securing the notes or if the Collateral is sold. EFIHs guarantees of the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes are secured by the Collateral on a parity lien basis with the notes. In addition, the indentures governing the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes provide that EFH Corp. and EFIH may incur up to an aggregate of $4.0 billion of debt, including the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, which would be secured on a parity lien basis by the Collateral. Therefore, because the principal amount of the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes is less than $4.0 billion, EFH Corp. and EFIH may subsequently incur additional debt secured on a parity lien basis by the Collateral up to the $4.0 billion limit, subject to restrictions on their ability to incur debt and liens under the indenture governing the notes and under other documents governing their indebtedness. To the extent that any of this additional debt is incurred in the future, the interests of holders of the notes in the Collateral will be diluted. Additionally, EFH Corp. and EFIH are not restricted from issuing additional debt that is secured by a junior lien on the Collateral, subject to restrictions on their ability to incur debt and liens under the indenture governing the notes and under other documents governing their indebtedness. 12 Table of Contents The collateral trust agreement governing the pledge of Collateral generally provides that the holders of a majority of the debt secured by a first priority lien on the Collateral, including the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes, the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes and any future debt incurred by EFH Corp. or EFIH secured by the Collateral equally and ratably, will have, subject to certain limited exceptions, the exclusive right to manage, perform and enforce the terms of the security documents securing the rights of secured debtholders in the Collateral, and to exercise and enforce all privileges, rights and remedies thereunder. To the extent that EFH Corp. and/or EFIH incurs additional secured debt that is secured equally and ratably with the notes and the amount of this additional secured debt, alone or together with any EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, exceeds the amount of the notes, the holders of such secured debt may be able to exercise control under the collateral trust agreement and other security documents. EFIH will in most cases have control over the Collateral securing the notes and EFIHs guarantees of the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, and to the extent permitted, its sale by EFIH would eliminate the collateral securing such notes and guarantees. The documents governing the pledge of the Collateral permit EFIH to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of, any income from, the Collateral, such as cash dividends. In addition, in certain limited circumstances EFIH will have the right to sell the Collateral free and clear of the security interest underlying the notes. Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in certain Collateral acquired in the future. EFIH may acquire assets or investments in the future that would be required to be pledged as Collateral securing the notes. There can be no assurance that the trustee or the collateral trustee will monitor, or that we will inform the trustee or the collateral trustee of, the future acquisition of assets or investments that would be required to be pledged as Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the trustee nor the collateral trustee has an obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional assets or investments that are required to be pledged as Collateral or the perfection of any security interest in such Collateral. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes against third parties. We may transfer or dispose of our interests in Oncor Holdings to a third party in a manner that would result in such third party becoming the obligor under the notes, without EFIH being required to offer to repurchase the notes. The risks of an investment in the notes may increase further following such a transaction. The indenture governing the notes provides that EFIH may engage in a Permitted Asset Transfer with respect to EFIHs ownership of Oncor Holdings that would result in the obligations under the notes being assumed by a third party to which the investments in the Oncor Subsidiaries are transferred in any such Permitted Asset Transfer (referred to as a third party transferee). Permitted Asset Transfer includes:  the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (including by way of merger, wind-up or consolidation) or spin-off of the equity of EFIH such that it is no longer a subsidiary of EFH Corp., and  the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, wind-up or consolidation) of all of EFIHs equity interests and other investments in the Oncor Subsidiaries or successor Oncor business and all other Collateral held by EFIH. 13 Table of Contents If a valid Permitted Asset Transfer occurs, the notes would become obligations of the third party transferee of the investments in the Oncor Subsidiaries, which would result in EFIH no longer being liable on the notes. In connection with a Permitted Asset Transfer to a third party transferee, such third party transferee, as the successor obligor, may not have sufficient sources of capital to service its debt and the obligations under the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 and 2020 Notes, which would also be assumed by the third party transferee, and distributions from the Oncor Subsidiaries may not be available or sufficient to service the obligations under the notes. No Oncor Subsidiary will become obligated on the notes, the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes or the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes as a result of a Permitted Asset Transfer. Additionally, if a Permitted Asset Transfer occurs in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the Issuer will not be required to make a change of control offer to repurchase the notes under the indenture even if a change of control may otherwise have occurred. If a merger of EFIH into EFH Corp. occurs, the covenants, events of default and other terms of the notes will be amended to be substantially similar to those of the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes. The amended provisions may be less restrictive than the original terms of the notes, in particular with respect to the ability to incur debt or make restricted payments. The indenture governing the notes provides that a Permitted Asset Transfer may only occur if certain conditions are met, including a requirement that the ratings of the notes are not lowered by two or more rating agencies (or the only rating agency then rating such notes) during a specified period before or after the proposed Permitted Asset Transfer has been publicly announced. However, these conditions may not protect holders against actions that EFIH or the permitted transferee could take that may negatively impact the credit risk of the notes following a Permitted Asset Transfer, such as removing assets and cash from EFIH or the Oncor Subsidiaries or increasing debt at EFIH before the Permitted Asset Transfer. In addition, because EFIH is a Restricted Subsidiary under the indentures governing the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes and the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes, assets of EFIH, other than the Collateral, could be transferred to EFH Corp. prior to a Permitted Asset Transfer and would in that case not be assets of EFIH or a third party transferee that has become the obligor of the notes. The third party transferee that becomes the obligor on the notes may itself engage in a subsequent Permitted Asset Transfer, in which case the risks described above would continue to apply with respect to the subsequent Permitted Asset Transfer and the subsequent third party transferee. There will be no event of default under the indenture governing the notes if the Oncor Subsidiaries take actions or enter into transactions that would impair their ability to dividend funds to EFIH, which could impair EFIHs ability to make payments on the notes, or that would negatively affect the value of the assets that are pledged as Collateral, such as incurring debt, selling or transferring all or a portion of the assets of Oncor, entering into joint ventures, dividending out assets or engaging in speculative investments. Any of the above actions on the part of EFIH, the third party transferee or subsequent third party transferee or the Oncor Subsidiaries following the completion of a Permitted Asset Transfer may further increase the credit risk of the notes, may result in the rating agencies taking negative action with respect to the notes and may reduce the market price of the notes. See the definitions of Change of Control and Permitted Asset Transfer contained under Description of the Notes for more information. The indenture governing the notes may not protect holders from all actions that EFH Corp., EFIH or the Oncor Subsidiaries may take that would reduce your interest in the Collateral or that may reduce the value of the Collateral, including sales or exchanges of the Collateral or the assets of the Oncor Subsidiaries for other assets or investments. Under the indenture governing the notes, EFIH may dispose of all or a portion of the Collateral for fair market value consideration (including consideration other than cash) that may consist of assets or equity interests in joint ventures. Additionally, there will be no event of default under such indenture if the Oncor Subsidiaries sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of their assets or equity interests for any form of consideration. 14 Table of Contents If EFIH or the Oncor Subsidiaries effect any of these transactions, holders interest in the Collateral or the value of the Collateral may be materially reduced. The indenture governing the notes allows EFIH to transfer any of the Collateral in exchange for an equivalent fair market value of assets other than cash or for investments in businesses that are similar to the businesses of Oncor, including interests in joint ventures in businesses that are not controlled by EFH Corp. or EFIH. The assets received as consideration and pledged as substitute Collateral may prove to be less valuable than the value of the investments in Oncor that were disposed of in such transfer or exchange. Additionally, if interests in a new business were received in exchange for the Collateral, such new business may, in the future, engage in business activities that are different from the business that Oncor presently is in or such new business may not prove to be as creditworthy or valuable as Oncor, and EFIH may not have any control over such business activities if a minority interest in the joint venture interests was received in such transfer or exchange. Therefore, such new collateral may negatively alter the risk profile of EFIH or the value of such new collateral may decline relative to the value of the disposed investments in Oncor. There will be no event of default under the indenture governing the notes if any of the Oncor Subsidiaries sells, transfers or disposes of the assets of Oncor Holdings or investments in or assets of Oncor. The consideration received in exchange for such assets or investments may decline in value as compared to the assets or investments that were so disposed, and, therefore, the value of the Collateral may be less than if such assets and investments had been retained. The Oncor Subsidiaries may transfer their assets and investments in exchange for interests in other businesses or assets, minority interests or interests in joint ventures, in which case the value of the Collateral may be at risk of declining due to the factors described above. In any joint venture in which EFIH or an Oncor Subsidiary has an interest, EFIH or the Oncor Subsidiary may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of such joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to the instructions or requests of EFIH or such Oncor Subsidiary or against its policies and objectives, and any such actions taken by such joint ventures may not be in the best interests of holders of notes. In addition, the other participants to any such joint venture may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the goals of EFIH or such Oncor Subsidiary and/or the holders of the notes. The completion of any of the above events may result in the credit risk of the notes increasing, the credit rating agencies taking negative action with respect to the notes or the market price of the notes declining. Additionally, in the event of any foreclosure on the Collateral, holders of the notes may recover less than if the Collateral still consisted of investments in the Oncor Subsidiaries. You may be required to recognize taxable gain or loss in connection with a Permitted Asset Transfer. In connection with a Permitted Asset Transfer, EFIHs obligations under the notes would be transferred to, and assumed by, a third party transferee or may be considered, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to undergo a substitution of obligors even if not transferred to, or assumed by, a third party transferee. Upon any such transfer or deemed substitution of obligors, you may be deemed to have exchanged the notes for new notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Upon such deemed exchange, a holder, under U.S. federal income tax law, may be required to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount deemed to be realized in connection with the deemed exchange and such holders adjusted tax basis in the notes on the date of the deemed exchange. For more information, please see Material U.S. Federal Tax ConsiderationsMaterial Tax Consequences to U.S. HoldersSale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes. 15 Table of Contents If a court were to find that EFIH were insolvent before or after giving effect to the issuance of the notes and did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the issuance of the notes or the pledge of the Collateral, the court may void all or a portion of the obligations represented by the notes or the pledge of the Collateral by EFIH as a fraudulent conveyance. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a trustee, debtor in possession or another person acting on behalf of the bankruptcy estate may seek to recover all or a portion of transfers made or void obligations incurred prior to the bankruptcy proceeding on the basis that such transfers and obligations constituted fraudulent conveyances. Under certain circumstances, creditors may recover transfers or void obligations under state fraudulent conveyance laws even if the debtor is not in bankruptcy. Fraudulent conveyances are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred for inadequate consideration when a debtor was insolvent, inadequately capitalized or in similar financial distress, or transfers made or obligations incurred with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors. A trustee, debtor in possession or another person acting on behalf of a bankruptcy estate may be able to recover such transfers under the fraudulent conveyance provisions of the bankruptcy law and/or state fraudulent conveyance laws. The fraudulent conveyance provisions of the bankruptcy law allows the trustee, debtor in possession, or other person acting on behalf of a bankruptcy estate to void a fraudulent conveyance made within two years prior to the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding. Under state fraudulent conveyance laws, transfers made more than two years prior to the commencement of a fraudulent conveyance lawsuit may be subject to avoidance. If a court were to find that the Issuer issued the notes or EFIH granted its pledge of the Collateral under circumstances constituting a fraudulent conveyance, then a court could void all or a portion of the obligations under the notes or the pledge of the Collateral. In addition, under such circumstances, the value of any consideration holders received with respect to the notes and the Collateral, including upon foreclosure of the Collateral, could also be subject to recovery from such holders and, possibly, from subsequent transferees of the notes. If the pledge of the Collateral was voided and the issuance of the notes was not voided, then holders of notes would become unsecured creditors. The notes or the pledge of the Collateral by EFIH could be voided as a fraudulent conveyance, or claims in respect of the notes or pledge could be subordinated to all other debts of the Issuer, if the Issuer, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by the notes or granted the pledge, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the issuance of the notes or the grant of the pledge of the Collateral and the Issuer:  was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance or grant;  was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuers remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or  intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a debtor would be considered insolvent if:  the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets;  the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or  it could not pay its debts as they become due. 16 Table of Contents The assets of EFIH currently exceed its liabilities as shown on its balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of December 31, 2009; however, the values assigned to assets and liabilities in its balance sheet are not necessarily indicative of the values that a court would assign to such assets and liabilities in making a solvency determination. At the time of issuance of the notes, we did not obtain or prepare an appraisal of the fair saleable value of the assets of EFIH. As a result, we cannot assure you that EFIH would satisfy the solvency tests set forth in the bullet points immediately prior to this paragraph or what standard a court would apply in determining whether EFIH would be considered to be insolvent. In addition, we cannot assure you that a court would determine that reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration was received by EFIH in connection with the issuance of the notes and the grant of the pledge. The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control. Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all of the notes at 101% of their respective principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for any purchase of the notes will be the Issuers available cash or cash generated from the Issuers subsidiaries operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control because the Issuer may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Further, EFIH may be restricted under the terms of debt agreements of TCEH and Oncor from receiving funds from TCEH (via EFH Corp.) and Oncor sufficient to repurchase all of the notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, the Issuer may not be able to satisfy its obligations to purchase the notes unless the Issuer is able to refinance or obtain waivers under the instruments governing its indebtedness. The Issuers failure to repurchase the notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture governing the notes. Any of the Issuers future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no assurance that any active trading market will develop for the notes. Although the notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, there may, nonetheless, be limited liquidity in the trading market for the notes. The Market Maker has advised us that it and its affiliates intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, neither the Market Maker nor any of its affiliates is obligated to make a market in the notes, and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, it may be restricted in its market-making activities. The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, our performance, the market for similar securities, the interest in securities dealers making a market in the notes and other factors. Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active market for the notes will develop or, if developed, that it will continue. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the notes will be adversely affected. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if any, for the notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, the notes may trade at a discount from your purchase price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. The interests of the Sponsor Group may differ from the interests of the holders of the notes. The Sponsor Group indirectly owns approximately 60% of EFH Corp.s capital stock on a fully diluted basis through their investment in Texas Holdings. Affiliates of the Market Maker may be deemed, as a result of their ownership of approximately 27% of the General Partners outstanding units and certain provisions of the General Partners Limited Liability Company Agreement, to have shared voting or dispositive power over Texas Holdings. As a result of this ownership and the Sponsor Groups ownership in interests of the general partner of Texas Holdings, the Sponsor Group has indirect control over decisions regarding our operations, plans, strategies, finances and structure, including whether to enter into any corporate transaction, and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of the holders of our equity interests. 17 Table of Contents The interests of these persons may differ from your interests in material respects. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of the Sponsor Group, as indirect equity holders, might conflict with your interests as a noteholder. The Sponsor Group may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a noteholder. Additionally, the indenture governing the notes permits us to pay advisory fees, dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and the Sponsor Group may have an interest in our doing so. Risks Related to Structure EFIH is a holding company and its obligations are structurally subordinated to existing and future liabilities and preferred stock of its subsidiaries. EFIHs cash flows and ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries, and the payment of such earnings to EFIH in the form of dividends and distributions. These subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide EFIH with funds for its payment obligations. Any decision by a subsidiary to provide EFIH with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends or distributions, will depend on, among other things, the subsidiarys results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, a subsidiarys ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants in its existing and future debt agreements or applicable law. Because EFIH is a holding company, its obligations to its creditors are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and existing and future preferred stock of its subsidiaries that do not guarantee such obligations. Therefore, with respect to EFIHs subsidiaries (other than EFIH Finance) that do not guarantee EFIHs obligations, EFIHs rights and the rights of its creditors to participate in the assets of any subsidiary in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized are subject to the prior claims of such subsidiarys creditors and holders of such subsidiarys preferred stock. To the extent that EFIH may be a creditor with recognized claims against any such subsidiary, EFIHs claims would still be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiarys creditors to the extent that they are secured or senior to those held by EFIH. Subject to restrictions contained in financing arrangements, EFIHs subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness and other liabilities. Oncor may or may not make any distributions to EFIH. EFH Corp. and Oncor have implemented certain structural and operational ring-fencing measures based on principles articulated by rating agencies and commitments made by Texas Holdings and Oncor to the PUCT and the FERC to further enhance Oncors credit quality. These measures were put into place to mitigate Oncors credit exposure to the Texas Holdings Group and to reduce the risk that the assets and liabilities of Oncor would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of the Texas Holdings Group in the event of a bankruptcy of one or more of those entities. As part of the ring-fencing measures, a majority of the members of the board of directors of Oncor are required to be, and are, independent from EFH Corp. Any new independent directors of Oncor are required to be appointed by the nominating committee of Oncor Holdings. The organizational documents of Oncor give these independent directors, acting by majority vote, and, during certain periods, any director designated by Texas Transmission, the express right to prevent distributions from Oncor if they determine that it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Oncor will make any distributions to EFIH. In addition, Oncors organizational documents limit Oncors distributions to EFIH through December 31, 2012 to an amount not to exceed Oncors net income (determined in accordance with GAAP, subject to certain defined adjustments, including goodwill impairments) and prohibit Oncor from making any distribution to EFIH so long as and to the extent that such distribution would cause Oncors debt-to-equity ratio for regulatory purposes to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio established from time to time by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes, which is currently set at 60% debt to 40% equity. 18 Table of Contents In March 2009, the PUCT awarded Oncor the right to construct approximately $1.3 billion of transmission lines and facilities associated with its Competitive Renewable Energy Zone Transmission Plan (see discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRegulation and Rates included in our 2009 Form 10-K). With the award, it is likely Oncor will incur additional debt. In addition, Oncor may incur additional debt in connection with other investments in infrastructure or technology. Accordingly, while Oncor is required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of 60% debt to 40% equity, there can be no assurance that Oncors equity balance will be sufficient to maintain the required debt-to-equity ratio established from time to time by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes, thereby restricting Oncor from making any distributions to EFIH. 19 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus, including the information incorporated by reference into this prospectus, contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that are included in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus, or made in presentations, in response to questions or otherwise, that address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate to occur in the future, including such matters as projections, capital allocation, future capital expenditures, business strategy, competitive strengths, goals, future acquisitions or dispositions, development or operation of facilities, market and industry developments and the growth of our business and operations (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, estimated, should, projection, target, goal, objective and outlook), are forward-looking statements. Although we believe that in making any such forward-looking statement our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such forward-looking statement involves uncertainties and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the discussion of risk factors under Risk Factors contained elsewhere in this prospectus, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2009 Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus, and the following important factors, among others, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements:  prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of the Texas Legislature, the Governor of Texas, the FERC, the PUCT, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, with respect to, among other things:  allowed rate of return;  permitted capital structure;  industry, market and rate structure;  recovery of investments;  acquisitions and disposals of assets and facilities;  operation and construction of facilities;  changes in tax laws and policies; and  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;  legal and administrative proceedings and settlements;  weather conditions and other natural phenomena, and acts of sabotage, wars or terrorist activities;  economic conditions, including the current recessionary environment;  unanticipated population growth or decline, or changes in market demand and demographic patterns;  changes in business strategy, development plans or vendor relationships;  unanticipated changes in interest rates or rates of inflation;  unanticipated changes in operating expenses, liquidity needs and capital expenditures;  the inability of various counterparties to meet their financial obligations to us, including failure of counterparties to perform under agreements;  general industry trends;  hazards customary to the industry and the possibility that we may not have adequate insurance to cover losses resulting from such hazards;  changes in technology used by and services offered by us; 20 Table of Contents  significant changes in our relationship with our employees, including the availability of qualified personnel, and the potential adverse effects if labor disputes or grievances were to occur;  changes in assumptions used to estimate costs of providing employee benefits, including pension and other postretirement employee benefits, and future funding requirements related thereto;  significant changes in critical accounting policies material to us;  commercial bank and financial market conditions, access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of financing and refinancing efforts by us, including availability of funds in the capital markets and the potential impact of disruptions in U.S. credit markets;  circumstances that may contribute to future impairments of goodwill, intangible or other long lived assets;  financial restrictions imposed by Oncors revolving credit facility and indentures governing our debt instruments;  our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make interest payments on our debt instruments;  actions by credit rating agencies; and  our ability to effectively execute our operational strategy. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them; nor can we assess the impact of each such factor or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. You should not unduly rely on such forward-looking statements. INDUSTRY AND MARKET INFORMATION The industry and market data and other statistical information used throughout this prospectus are based on independent industry publications, government publications, reports by market research firms or other published independent sources, including certain data published by Electric Reliability Council of Texas or the PUCT. We did not commission any of these publications or reports. Some data is also based on our good faith estimates, which are derived from our review of internal surveys, as well as the independent sources listed above. Independent industry publications and surveys generally state that they have obtained information from sources believed to be reliable but do not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such information. While we believe that each of these studies and publications is reliable, we have not independently verified such data and make no representation as to the accuracy of such information. Forecasts are particularly likely to be inaccurate, especially over long periods of time, and we do not know what assumptions regarding general economic growth are used in preparing the forecasts included in this prospectus. Similarly, while we believe that such internal and external research is reliable, it has not been verified by any independent sources, and we make no assurances that the predictions contained therein are accurate. USE OF PROCEEDS This prospectus may be delivered in connection with the resale of notes by the Market Maker and its affiliates in market-making transactions in the notes in the secondary market. We will not receive any of the proceeds from such resales. 21 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES General Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading Certain Definitions. In this description, (i) the terms  w e,  our  and  us  each refer to Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company LLC ( EFIH ) and its consolidated Subsidiaries; and (ii) the term  Issuer  refers only to collectively, EFIH and EFIH Finance Inc. ( EFIH Finance ), a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of EFIH, and not to any of EFIHs other Subsidiaries. The Issuer issued $141,083,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the  Notes ) under an Indenture dated as of November 16, 2009 (the  Indenture ) between the Issuer and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the  Trustee ), in the Exchange Offer. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC ( Oncor Electric Delivery ) has undertaken certain ring-fencing measures to separate itself, its subsidiaries and its immediate parent, Oncor Electric Delivery Holdings Company LLC ( Oncor Holdings ), from Energy Future Holdings Corp. ( EFH Corp. ) and EFH Corp.s other Affiliates, including the Issuer. Those measures include the Oncor Subsidiaries being treated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries with respect to the Notes and with respect to the 2017 Notes, the EFH Corp. Notes and the 10.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 issued on January 12, 2010 and March 16, 2010 (the  2020 Notes ), in each case, issued by EFH Corp. and guaranteed by EFIH and Energy Future Competitive Holdings Company ( EFCH ). As Unrestricted Subsidiaries, the Oncor Subsidiaries are not subject to any of the covenants described herein and do not guarantee the Notes. The Holders of the Notes, by accepting the Notes, acknowledge (i) the legal separateness of the Issuer from the Oncor Subsidiaries, (ii) that the lenders under the Oncor Electric Delivery Facility and the noteholders under Oncors existing debt instruments have likely advanced funds thereunder in reliance upon the separateness of the Oncor Subsidiaries from the Issuer, (iii) that the Oncor Subsidiaries have assets and liabilities that are separate from those of the Issuer and its other Subsidiaries, (iv) that the obligations owing under the Notes are obligations and liabilities of the Issuer only, and are not the obligations or liabilities of any Oncor Subsidiary, (v) that the Holders of the Notes shall look solely to the Issuer and its assets, and not to any assets, or to the pledge of any assets, owned by any Oncor Subsidiary, for the repayment of any amounts payable pursuant to the Notes and for satisfaction of any other obligations owing to the Holders under the Indenture and any related documents and (vi) that none of the Oncor Subsidiaries shall be personally liable to the Holders of the Notes for any amounts payable, or any other obligation, under the Indenture or any related documents. The Holders of the Notes, by accepting the Notes, acknowledge and agree that the Holders of the Notes will not (i) initiate any legal proceeding to procure the appointment of an administrative receiver or (ii) institute any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, winding up, liquidation, or any like proceeding under applicable law, against any Oncor Subsidiary, or against any of the Oncor Subsidiaries assets. The Holders further acknowledge and agree that each of the Oncor Subsidiaries is a third party beneficiary of the forgoing covenant and will have the right to specifically enforce such covenant in any proceeding at law or in equity. The foregoing acknowledgements and agreements are contained in the Indenture. The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Indenture and the Security Documents because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture and the Security Documents at our address set forth under the heading Incorporation by Reference. No Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer does not have any Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date of this prospectus. As of the date of this prospectus, the only Subsidiaries of EFIH consist of the Oncor Subsidiaries, which are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and EFH Finance, which does not have any Subsidiaries. Accordingly, none of EFIHs Subsidiaries (other than EFIH Finance) are subject to the restrictive covenants described herein and none of such Subsidiaries guarantee the Notes. 22 Table of Contents Brief Description of Notes The Notes:  are senior obligations of the Issuer and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (including EFIHs guarantees of certain of EFH Corp.s Indebtedness, including the 2017 Notes, the EFH Corp. Notes and the 2020 Notes);  are secured by the pledge of any investments EFIH owns in any Oncor Subsidiary (as described below under Security for the Notes), which on the date of this prospectus consist of all of the membership interests EFIH owns in Oncor Holdings;  are effectively senior to all unsecured Indebtedness of EFIH and any future Junior Lien Debt, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;  are effectively subordinated to any Indebtedness of EFIH secured by assets of EFIH other than the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;  are structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness and other liabilities of the Subsidiaries of EFIH (other than EFIH Finance), including the Oncor Subsidiaries, any of the Issuers Foreign Subsidiaries and any other Unrestricted Subsidiaries; and  are senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessIf a court were to find that EFIH were insolvent before or after giving effect to the issuance of the notes in the exchange offers and did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the issuance of the notes or the pledge of the Collateral, the court may void all or a portion of the obligations represented by the notes or the pledge of the Collateral by EFIH as a fraudulent conveyance. Holding Company Structure EFIH is a holding company for its Subsidiaries, including EFIH Finance, with no material operations of its own and only limited assets. Accordingly, EFIH is dependent upon the distribution of the earnings of its Subsidiaries, whether in the form of dividends, advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations, and investments into EFIH by its parent company, EFH Corp., to service its debt obligations. EFH Corp. is itself a holding company, and is primarily dependent upon the distribution of the earnings of its other Subsidiaries (including TCEH and its Subsidiaries), whether in the form of dividends, advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations, and investments into EFH Corp. by its parent company, Texas Energy Future Holdings Limited Partnership, to make such Investments in EFIH. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to StructureEFIH is a holding company and its obligations are structurally subordinated to existing and future liabilities and preferred stock of its subsidiaries. As of the date of this prospectus, the Notes are not guaranteed. Therefore, the Notes are structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness and other liabilities of all the Subsidiaries of EFIH (other than EFIH Finance). In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to EFIH. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries generated all of the Issuers consolidated total revenue. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries held more than 99% of the Issuers consolidated total assets. 23 Table of Contents Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes is the Trustee at its offices in Houston, Texas. The Issuer will also maintain a registrar. The initial registrar is the Trustee at its offices in Houston, Texas. The registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar. Transfer and Exchange A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. Principal, Maturity and Interest The Issuer issued $141.1 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date in the Exchange Offer. The Notes will mature on October 15, 2019. Subject to compliance with the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain CovenantsLiens, the Issuer may issue additional Notes from time to time after the Issue Date under the Indenture (any such Notes,  Additional Notes ). The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Notes for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of the Notes section include any Additional Notes that are actually issued. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 9.75% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2010, to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding April 1 and October 1. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose within the City of Houston and State of Texas or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuers office or agency in Houston, Texas will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders. The Issuer may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise. 24 Table of Contents Optional Redemption Except as set forth below, the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem Notes at its option prior to October 15, 2014. At any time prior to October 15, 2014, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder of Notes or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the date of redemption (the Redemption Date), subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. On and after October 15, 2014, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to the registered address of each Holder of Notes or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on October 15 of each of the years indicated below: Year Percentage 2014 104.875 % 2015 103.250 % 2016 101.625 % 2017 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, until October 15, 2012, the Issuer may, at its option, on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes at a redemption price equal to 109.750% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that at least 50% of the sum of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture and the original principal amount of any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption; and provided , further that each such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of closing of each such Equity Offering. Any notice of any redemption may be given prior to the redemption thereof, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering or other corporate transaction. If the Issuer redeems less than all of the outstanding Notes, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed in the manner described under Repurchase at the Option of HoldersSelection and Notice. Security for the Notes Collateral Trustee EFIH has appointed The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. to serve as the collateral trustee (the  Collateral Trustee ) for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Debt Obligations outstanding from time to time. 25 Table of Contents The Security Documents provide that the Collateral Trustee is subject to such directions as may be given it by the Trustee and by any other Parity Lien Debt Representatives from time to time as required or permitted by the Indenture and the other Parity Lien Debt Documents. The relative rights with respect to control of the Collateral Trustee are specified in the collateral trust agreement dated as of November 16, 2009 by and among EFIH, the trustees for the Notes and the EFH Corp. Notes, any other Parity Lien Debt Representatives (including the trustee for the 2020 Notes, which entered into joinders to such collateral trust agreement on January 12, 2010 and March 16, 2010), any Junior Lien Debt Representatives and the Collateral Trustee (the  Collateral Trust Agreement ). Except as provided in the Collateral Trust Agreement or as directed by an Act of Required Debtholders, the Collateral Trustee will not be obligated: (1) to act upon directions purported to be delivered to it by any other Person; (2) to foreclose upon or otherwise enforce any Lien; or (3) to take any other action whatsoever with regard to any or all of the Security Documents, the Liens created thereby or the Collateral. Collateral The Indenture and the Security Documents provide that all Note Obligations of EFIH, together with any other Parity Lien Debt (which on the date of this prospectus includes the EFH Corp. Notes and the 2020 Notes), are secured on an equal and ratable basis by first-priority security interests granted to the Collateral Trustee, in all of the following property of EFIH: (1) any Equity Interests it owns on the date of this prospectus or may hereafter acquire in any Oncor Subsidiary and any promissory notes or other Indebtedness owed by, or other Investments in, any Oncor Subsidiary that it owns on the date of this prospectus or may hereafter acquire; (2) all proceeds of, income and other payments (including, without limitation, dividends and distributions received) now or hereafter due and payable with respect to, and supporting obligations relating to, any and all of the foregoing, which, in the case of cash dividends and distributions received by EFIH from Oncor Holdings may be used by EFIH for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture so long as no Event of Default and no event of default under any other Parity Lien Debt, including the EFH Corp. Notes and the 2020 Notes, shall have occurred and be continuing; and (3) any Asset Sale Cash Collateral Account established pursuant to the Indenture, the EFH Corp. Notes Indenture or the indenture pursuant to which the 2020 Notes were issued. On the date of this prospectus, the Collateral consists of a pledge of all of the membership interests EFIH owns in Oncor Holdings. Oncor Holdings owns approximately 80% of Oncor Electric Deliverys outstanding membership interests. On November 16, 2009, EFIH and the Collateral Trustee entered into a pledge agreement (the  Pledge Agreement ), whereby the Collateral was pledged in favor of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Collateral Trustee, the trustees for the Notes and the EFH Corp. Notes and the holders of the Notes and the EFH Corp. Notes and the holders of any other Secured Debt Obligations issued in accordance with the Indenture and the EFH Corp. Notes Indenture (including the 2020 Notes). The Collateral does not consist of any assets of any Oncor Subsidiary. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessThe notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the notes;  Regulatory approvals may be required in order to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and to dispose of an interest in, or operational control of, the Collateral that secures the notes; In the event of the Issuers bankruptcy, the ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon the Collateral securing the notes will be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations; and The value of the Collateral may be diluted if we issue additional debt that is secured equally and ratably by the same Collateral securing the notes or if the Collateral is sold. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on many factors. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Secured Debt Obligations, including the Notes. 26 Table of Contents The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the Parity Lien Obligations, including the Note Obligations. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by Holders of the Notes from the sale of Collateral securing the Secured Debt Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated Indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. So long as no Event of Default and no event of default under any other Parity Lien Debt, including the EFH Corp. Notes and the 2020 Notes, shall have occurred and be continuing, and subject to certain terms and conditions, EFIH will be entitled to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral (other than as set forth in the Pledge Agreement and the other Security Documents). The Pledge Agreement requires EFIH to deliver to the Collateral Trustee, for the Collateral Trustee to maintain in its possession, certificates, if any, evidencing the Collateral. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under the Notes, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the provisions of the Pledge Agreement, all of the rights of EFIH to exercise voting or other consensual rights with respect to the Collateral will cease, and all such rights will become vested in the Collateral Trustee, which, to the extent permitted by law, will have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights. Certain bankruptcy limitations The right of the Collateral Trustee to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired by applicable bankruptcy law in the event that a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against EFIH prior to the Collateral Trustee having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the  Bankruptcy Code ), a secured creditor such as the Collateral Trustee is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from the debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the Collateral Trustee could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The Bankruptcy Code permits only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys fees to a secured creditor during a debtors bankruptcy case to the extent the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount at maturity of the obligations secured by the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the value of the Collateral will exceed the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Debt Obligations, including the EFH Corp. Notes and the 2020 Notes. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the other Parity Lien Debt Obligations, including the EFH Corp. Notes and the 2020 Notes, the Holders of the Notes and the holders of the other Parity Lien Debt would hold secured claims to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes and the holders of the other Parity Lien Debt are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to any such shortfall. 27 Table of Contents Additional Parity Lien Debt On the Issue Date, $115.5 million of EFH Corp. Notes were issued in the Exchange Offer by EFH Corp. and guaranteed by EFIH and EFCH, and on January 12, 2010 and March 16, 2010, $500 million and $34 million, respectively, of 2020 Notes were issued by EFH Corp. and guaranteed by EFIH and EFCH. All of the EFH Corp. Notes and the 2020 Notes are secured by the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with the Notes and constitute Parity Lien Debt. The Indenture and the Security Documents provide that the Issuer may incur additional Parity Lien Debt as permitted by the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain CovenantsLiens, by issuing Additional Notes under the Indenture or under one or more additional indentures or incurring other Indebtedness secured by Parity Liens on the Collateral. All additional Parity Lien Debt will be secured equally and ratably with the Notes by Liens on the Collateral held by the Collateral Trustee for as long as EFIHs Note Obligations are secured by the Collateral. The Collateral Trustee under the Collateral Trust Agreement will hold all Parity Liens in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, the EFH Corp. Notes, the 2020 Notes and the holders of any future Parity Lien Debt and all other Parity Lien Obligations. Additional Parity Lien Debt will be permitted to be secured by the Collateral only if such Parity Lien Debt and the related Parity Liens are permitted to be incurred under the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain CovenantsLiens. The agent or representative of any Parity Lien Debt will become a party to the Security Documents by joinder agreement. Future Junior Lien Debt The Indenture and the Security Documents provide that EFIH may incur Junior Lien Debt in the future by issuing or guaranteeing debt securities under one or more indentures, incurring Indebtedness under Credit Facilities or otherwise issuing or increasing a new Series of Secured Lien Debt secured by Junior Liens on the Collateral. Junior Lien Debt will be permitted to be secured by the Collateral only if such Junior Lien Debt and the related Junior Liens are permitted to be incurred under the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain CovenantsLiens. The Collateral Trustee under the Collateral Trust Agreement will hold all Junior Liens in trust for the benefit of the holders of any Junior Lien Debt and all other Junior Lien Obligations. The agent or representative of any Junior Lien Obligations shall become a party to the Collateral Trust Agreement by joinder agreement. Enforcement of Liens If the Collateral Trustee at any time receives written notice stating that any event has occurred that constitutes a default under any Secured Debt Document entitling the Collateral Trustee to foreclose upon, collect or otherwise enforce its Liens thereunder, it will promptly deliver written notice thereof to each Secured Debt Representative. Thereafter, the Collateral Trustee will await direction by an Act of Required Debtholders and will act, or decline to act, as directed by an Act of Required Debtholders, in the exercise and enforcement of the Collateral Trustees interests, rights, powers and remedies in respect of the Collateral or under the Security Documents or applicable law and, following the initiation of such exercise of remedies, the Collateral Trustee will act, or decline to act, with respect to the manner of such exercise of remedies as directed by an Act of Required Debtholders. Unless it has been directed to the contrary by an Act of Required Debtholders, the Collateral Trustee in any event may (but will not be obligated to) take or refrain from taking such action with respect to any default under any Secured Debt Document as it may deem advisable to preserve and protect the value of the Collateral. Until the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations, the Holders of the Notes and the holders of other Parity Lien Obligations will have, subject to the exceptions set forth below in clauses (1) through (4), the exclusive right to authorize and direct the Collateral Trustee with respect to the Security Documents and the Collateral (including, without limitation, the exclusive right to authorize or direct the Collateral Trustee to enforce, collect or realize on any Collateral or exercise any other right or remedy with respect to the Collateral) and neither the provisions of the Security Documents relating thereto (other than in accordance with the Collateral Trust Agreement) nor any Junior Lien Representative or holder of Junior Lien Obligations, if any, may authorize or direct the Collateral Trustee with respect to such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of Junior Lien Obligations may direct the Collateral Trustee with respect to such matters: (1) without any condition or restriction whatsoever, at any time after the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations; (2) to deliver any notice or demand necessary to enforce (subject to the prior Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations) any right to claim, take or receive proceeds of Collateral remaining after the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations; 28 Table of Contents (3) as necessary to perfect or establish the priority (subject to Parity Liens) of the Junior Liens upon any Collateral; provided that, unless otherwise agreed to by the Collateral Trustee in the Security Documents, the holders of Junior Lien Obligations may not require the Collateral Trustee to take any action to perfect any Collateral through possession or control (other than the Collateral Trustee as agent for the benefit of the Parity Lien Representative and holders of the Parity Lien Obligations agreeing pursuant to the Collateral Trust Agreement to act as bailee for the Collateral Trustee as agent for the benefit of the Junior Lien Representatives and holders of the Junior Lien Obligations); or (4) as necessary to create, prove, preserve or protect (but not enforce) the Junior Liens upon any Collateral. Both before and during an insolvency or liquidation proceeding until the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations, none of the holders of Junior Lien Obligations, the Collateral Trustee (unless acting pursuant to an Act of Required Debtholders) or any Junior Lien Representative will be permitted to: (1) request judicial relief, in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding or in any other court, that would hinder, delay, limit or prohibit the lawful exercise or enforcement of any right or remedy otherwise available to the holders of Parity Lien Obligations in respect of the Parity Liens or that would limit, invalidate, avoid or set aside any Parity Lien or subordinate the Parity Liens to the Junior Liens or grant the Junior Liens equal ranking to the Parity Liens; (2) oppose or otherwise contest any motion for (A) relief from the automatic stay or (B) any injunction against foreclosure or (C) any enforcement of Parity Liens, in each case made by any holder of Parity Lien Obligations or any Parity Lien Representative in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding; (3) oppose or otherwise contest any lawful exercise by any holder of Parity Lien Obligations or any Parity Lien Representative of the right to credit bid Parity Lien Obligations at any sale of Collateral in the foreclosure of Parity Liens; (4) oppose or otherwise contest any other request for judicial relief made in any court by any holder of Parity Lien Obligations or any Parity Lien Representative relating to the lawful enforcement of any Parity Lien; or (5) challenge the validity, enforceability, perfection or priority of the Parity Liens with respect to the Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, both before and during an insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the holders of Junior Lien Obligations or Junior Lien Representatives may take any actions and exercise any and all rights that would be available to a holder of unsecured claims, including, without limitation, the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding against EFIH in accordance with applicable law; provided the Collateral Trust Agreement provides that no holder of Junior Lien Obligations or Junior Lien Representative will be permitted to take any of the actions prohibited by clauses (1) through (5) of the preceding paragraph or oppose or contest any order that it has agreed not to oppose or contest under the provisions described under Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings. At any time prior to the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations and after (1) the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of EFIH or (2) the Collateral Trustee and each Junior Lien Representative have received written notice from any Parity Lien Representative stating that (A) any Series of Parity Lien Debt has become due and payable in full (whether at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) or (B) the holders of Parity Liens securing one or more Series of Parity Lien Debt have become entitled under any Parity Lien Document to and desire to enforce any or all of the Parity Liens by reason of a default under such Parity Lien Documents, no payment of money (or the equivalent of money) will be made from the proceeds of Collateral by EFIH to the Collateral Trustee (other than distributions to the Collateral Trustee in respect of its fees under the Collateral Trust Agreement and for the benefit of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations), any Junior Lien Representative or any holder of Junior Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, payments and prepayments made for application to Junior Lien Obligations). 29 Table of Contents All proceeds of Collateral received by any Junior Lien Representative or any holder of Junior Lien Obligations in violation of the immediately preceding paragraph will be held by such Person in trust for the account of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations and remitted to any Parity Lien Representative upon demand by such Parity Lien Representative. The Junior Liens will remain attached to and, subject to the provisions described under Provisions of the Indenture Relating to SecurityRanking of Parity Liens, enforceable against all proceeds so held or remitted. All proceeds of Collateral received by any Junior Lien Representative or any holder of Junior Lien Obligations not in violation of the immediately preceding paragraph will be received by such Person free from the Parity Liens. Pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Act ( PURA ), Texas Utilities Code §§39.262(l) and 39.915 and, through October 10, 2012, to the Order on Rehearing in Public Utility Commission of Texas ( PUCT ) Docket No. 34077, the PUCT must approve any change in majority ownership, controlling ownership or operational control of Oncor Electric Delivery. As a result, prior to any foreclosure on the Collateral consisting of membership interests in Oncor Holdings, approval of the PUCT will be required if such foreclosure consists of a change in majority ownership or control of Oncor Holdings. Pursuant to PURA §§39.262(m) and 39.915(b), the PUCT will approve such a transfer if it finds that the transaction is in the public interest. In making its determination, these sections of PURA provide that the PUCT will consider whether the transaction will adversely affect the reliability of service, availability of service or cost of service of Oncor Electric Delivery. We cannot assure you that such approval will be granted and, if it is not granted, the Collateral Trustee may not be able to liquidate the Collateral consisting of membership interests and, accordingly, the Collateral Trustee may not be able to distribute any proceeds to Holders of the Notes upon such foreclosure. If the approval is granted, then PUCT approval would also be required with respect to any subsequent disposition of a majority or controlling interest in the membership interests of Oncor Holdings. In addition, pursuant to the terms of an investor rights agreement among EFH Corp., Oncor Holdings, Oncor Electric Delivery and the minority investor in Oncor Electric Delivery, a transfer of the Equity Interests in Oncor Holdings to a third party, including as a result of any enforcement of the Lien on the Collateral consisting of Equity Interests of Oncor Holdings or Oncor Electric Delivery, may give rise to a tag-along right of the minority investor(s) in Oncor Electric Delivery to participate in that transfer on a pro rata basis. Waiver of Right of Marshalling The Collateral Trust Agreement provides that, prior to the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations, the holders of Junior Lien Obligations, each Junior Lien Representative and the Collateral Trustee may not assert or enforce any right of marshalling accorded to a junior lienholder, as against the holders of Parity Lien Obligations and the Parity Lien Representatives (in their capacity as senior or priority lienholders) with respect to the Collateral. Following the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations, the holders of Junior Lien Obligations and any Junior Lien Representative may assert their right under the Uniform Commercial Code or otherwise to any proceeds remaining following a sale or other disposition of Collateral by, or on behalf of, the holders of Parity Lien Obligations. Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings If in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and prior to the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations, the holders of Parity Lien Obligations by an Act of Required Debtholders consent to any order: (1) for use of cash collateral; (2) approving a debtor-in-possession financing secured by a Lien that is senior to or on a parity with all Parity Liens upon any property of the estate in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; (3) granting any relief on account of Parity Lien Obligations as adequate protection (or its equivalent) for the benefit of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations in the Collateral; or 30 Table of Contents (4) relating to a sale of assets of EFIH that provides, to the extent the Collateral sold is to be free and clear of Liens, that all Parity Liens and Junior Liens will attach to the proceeds of the sale; then, the holders of Junior Lien Obligations and the Junior Lien Representatives will not oppose or otherwise contest the entry of such order; provided , that the holders of Junior Lien Obligations or a Junior Lien Representative may request the grant to the Collateral Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of Junior Lien Obligations and the Junior Lien Representatives, of a Junior Lien upon any property on which a Lien is (or is to be) granted under such order to secure the Parity Lien Obligations, co-extensive in all respects with, but subordinated, as provided in the provisions described under Provisions of the Indenture Relating to SecurityRanking of Parity Liens, to, such Lien and all Parity Liens on such property. The holders of Parity Lien Obligations (including the Holders of the Notes) and the Parity Lien Representatives (including the Trustee) will agree not to oppose or otherwise contest in any respect any request made by the Junior Lien Representatives for a Junior Lien pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, both before and during an insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the holders of Junior Lien Obligations and the Junior Lien Representatives may take any actions and exercise any and all rights that would be available to a holder of unsecured claims, including, without limitation, the commencement of insolvency or liquidation proceedings against EFIH in accordance with applicable law; provided that the Collateral Trust Agreement provides that no holder of Junior Lien Obligations or Junior Lien Representative will be permitted to take any of the actions prohibited under the third and fourth paragraphs of the provisions described under Enforcement of Liens, or oppose or contest any order that it has agreed not to oppose or contest under clauses (1) through (4) of the preceding paragraph. Neither the holders of Junior Lien Obligations nor any Junior Lien Representative will file or prosecute in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding any motion for adequate protection (or any comparable request for relief) based upon their interest in the Collateral under the Junior Liens, except that: (1) they may freely seek and obtain relief granting a Junior Lien co-extensive in all respects with, but subordinated, as provided in the provisions described under Provisions of the Indenture Relating to SecurityRanking of Parity Liens, to, all Liens granted in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding to, or for the benefit of, the holders of Parity Lien Obligations; and (2) they may freely seek and obtain any relief upon a motion for adequate protection (or any comparable relief), without any condition or restriction whatsoever, at any time after the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations. Order of Application The Collateral Trust Agreement provides that if any Collateral is sold or otherwise realized upon by the Collateral Trustee in connection with any foreclosure, collection or other enforcement of Liens granted to the Collateral Trustee in the Security Documents, the proceeds received by the Collateral Trustee from such foreclosure, collection or other enforcement will be distributed by the Collateral Trustee in the following order of application: FIRST, to the payment of all amounts payable under the Collateral Trust Agreement on account of the Collateral Trustees fees and any reasonable legal fees, costs and expenses or other liabilities of any kind incurred by the Collateral Trustee or any co-trustee or agent of the Collateral Trustee in connection with any Security Document; SECOND, ratably to the respective Parity Lien Representatives for application, after payment of any fees and expenses (including but not limited to, attorneys fees and expenses) of such Parity Lien Representative, to the payment of all outstanding Notes and other Parity Lien Debt and any other Parity Lien Obligations that are then due and payable in such order as may be provided in the relevant Parity Lien Documents in an amount sufficient to pay in full in cash all outstanding Notes and other Parity Lien Debt and all other Parity Lien Obligations that are then due and payable (including all interest accrued thereon after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding at the rate, including any applicable post-default rate, specified in the relevant Parity Lien Documents, even if such interest is not enforceable, allowable or allowed as a claim in such proceeding, and including the discharge or cash collateralization (at the lower of (1) 105% of the aggregate undrawn amount and (2) the percentage of the aggregate undrawn amount required for release of Liens under the terms of the applicable Parity Lien Document) of all outstanding letters of credit constituting Parity Lien Debt); 31 Table of Contents THIRD, to the respective Junior Lien Representatives for application to the payment of all outstanding Junior Lien Debt and any other Junior Lien Obligations that are then due and payable in such order as may be provided in the Junior Lien Documents in an amount sufficient to pay in full in cash all outstanding Junior Lien Debt and all other Junior Lien Obligations that are then due and payable (including all interest accrued thereon after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding at the rate, including any applicable post-default rate, specified in the Junior Lien Documents, even if such interest is not enforceable, allowable or allowed as a claim in such proceeding, and including the discharge or cash collateralization (at the lower of (1) 105% of the aggregate undrawn amount and (2) the percentage of the aggregate undrawn amount required for release of Liens under the terms of the applicable Junior Lien Document) of all outstanding letters of credit, if any, constituting Junior Lien Debt); and FOURTH, any surplus remaining after the payment in full in cash of the amounts described in the preceding clauses will be paid to EFIH, or its successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. If any Junior Lien Representative or any holder of a Junior Lien Obligation collects or receives any proceeds in respect of any foreclosure, collection or other enforcement to which it was not entitled pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding paragraphs, whether after the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise, such Junior Lien Representative or such holder of a Junior Lien Obligation, as the case may be, will forthwith deliver the same to the Collateral Trustee to be applied in accordance with the provisions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraphs. Until so delivered, such proceeds will be held by that Junior Lien Representative or that holder of a Junior Lien Obligation, as the case may be, in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Parity Lien Obligations. These provisions will not apply to payments received by any holder of Junior Lien Obligations if such payments are not proceeds of, or the result of a realization upon, Collateral. The provisions set forth above under this Order of Application caption are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable as a third party beneficiary by, each present and future holder of Secured Debt Obligations, each present and future Secured Debt Representative and the Collateral Trustee as holder of Parity Liens and Junior Liens. EFIH will be required to cause the Secured Debt Representative of each future Series of Secured Lien Debt to deliver a joinder to the Collateral Trust Agreement, including a Lien Sharing and Priority Confirmation, to the Collateral Trustee and each other Secured Debt Representative at the time of incurrence of such Series of Secured Lien Debt. In connection with the application of proceeds in accordance with the provisions set forth above under this Order of Application caption, except as otherwise directed by an Act of Required Debtholders, the Collateral Trustee may sell any non-cash proceeds for cash prior to the application of the proceeds thereof. Release of Security Interests The Security Documents provide that the Collateral will be released: 1. in whole, upon (a) payment in full of all outstanding Secured Debt Obligations at the time such debt is paid in full and (b) termination or expiration of all commitments to extend credit under all Secured Debt Documents and the cancellation or termination or cash collateralization in an account maintained by the Collateral Trustee (at the lower of (1) 105% of the aggregate undrawn amount and (2) the percentage of the aggregate undrawn amount required for release of Liens under the terms of the applicable Secured Debt Documents) of all outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to any Secured Debt Documents; provided that the Issuer has delivered an Officers Certificate to the Collateral Trustee certifying that the conditions described in this paragraph 1. have been met and that such release of the Collateral does not violate the terms of any applicable Secured Debt Document; 2. with respect to the Note Obligations only, upon satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as set forth under Satisfaction and Discharge; 32 Table of Contents 3. with respect to the Note Obligations only, upon a Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as set forth under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance; 4. with respect to the Note Obligations only, upon payment in full of the Notes and all other Note Obligations that are outstanding, due and payable at the time the Notes are paid in full; 5. with respect to any Secured Debt Obligations (other than Note Obligations) only, upon payment in full of such Secured Lien Debt and all other Secured Debt Obligations in respect thereof that is outstanding, due and payable at the time such Secured Lien Debt is paid in full; 6. as to a release of all or substantially all of the Collateral, if (a) consent to the release of that Collateral has been given by holders of 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of Parity Lien Debt at the time outstanding voting together as one class, as provided for in the applicable Secured Debt Documents; provided that if an Event of Default under the Notes or an event of default with respect to any other Secured Lien Debt has occurred and is continuing at the time of the solicitation of any such consent, the consent of holders of 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of Secured Lien Debt at the time outstanding voting together as one class shall also be required, and (b) EFIH has delivered an Officers Certificate to the Collateral Trustee certifying that any such necessary consents have been obtained and that such release of the Collateral does not violate the terms of any applicable Secured Debt Document; 7. as to a release of less than all or substantially all of the Collateral, if (A) consent to the release of all Parity Liens (or, at any time after the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations, consent to the release of all Junior Liens) on such Collateral has been given by holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Parity Lien Debt at the time outstanding voting as one class, as provided for in the Parity Lien Documents (or, at any time after the Discharge of Parity Lien Obligations, holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Lien Debt at the time outstanding voting together as one class, as provided for in the Junior Lien Documents) and (B) EFIH has delivered an Officers Certificate to the Collateral Trustee certifying that any such necessary consents have been obtained and that such release of the Collateral does not violate the terms of any applicable Secured Debt Document; 8. as to any Collateral that is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by EFIH in a transaction or other circumstance that is not prohibited by the terms of any applicable Secured Debt Document, at the time of, or immediately prior to, such sale, transfer or other disposition; provided that EFIH has delivered an Officers Certificate to the Collateral Trustee certifying that any such sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the terms of any applicable Secured Debt Document; or 9. with respect to the Note Obligations only, in whole or in part, with the consent of the Holders of the requisite percentage of Notes in accordance with the provisions described under Amendment, Supplement and Waiver, and upon delivery of instructions and any other documentation, in each case as required by the Indenture and the Security Documents, in a form satisfactory to the Collateral Trustee. Upon compliance by EFIH with the conditions precedent set forth above, the Collateral Trustee will promptly cause to be released and reconveyed to EFIH the released Collateral. Amendment The Collateral Trust Agreement provides that no amendment or supplement to the provisions of the Collateral Trust Agreement or any other Security Document will be effective without the approval of the Collateral Trustee acting as directed by an Act of Required Debtholders, except that: (1) any amendment or supplement that has the effect solely of (a) adding or maintaining Collateral, securing additional Secured Lien Debt that was otherwise permitted by the terms of the Secured Debt Documents to be secured by the Collateral or preserving, perfecting or establishing the priority of the Liens thereon or the rights of the Collateral Trustee therein, (b) curing any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; (c) providing for the assumption of the obligations of EFIH under any Security Document in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of EFIH; or (d) making any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Secured Debt Obligations, the Secured Debt Representatives or the Collateral Trustee or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under any Secured Debt Document of any holder of Secured Debt Obligations, the Secured Debt Representatives or the Collateral Trustee, will, in each case, become effective when executed and delivered by EFIH and the Collateral Trustee; 33 Table of Contents (2) no amendment or supplement that reduces, impairs or adversely affects the right of any holder of Secured Debt Obligations: (a) to vote its outstanding Secured Lien Debt as to any matter described as subject to an Act of Required Debtholders or direction by the Required Parity Lien Debtholders or Required Junior Lien Debtholders (or amends the provisions of this clause (2) or the definition of Act of Required Debtholders, Required Parity Lien Debtholders or Required Junior Lien Debtholders); (b) to share in the order of application described under Order of Application in the proceeds of enforcement of or realization on any Collateral that has not been released in accordance with the provisions described under Release of Security Interests; or (c) to require that Liens securing Secured Debt Obligations be released only as set forth in the provisions described under Release of Security Interests, will become effective without the consent of the requisite percentage or number of holders of each Series of Secured Lien Debt so affected under the applicable Secured Debt Documents; and (3) no amendment or supplement that imposes any obligation upon the Collateral Trustee or any Secured Debt Representative or adversely affects the rights of the Collateral Trustee, as determined by the Collateral Trustee in its sole discretion, or any Secured Debt Representative, respectively, in its individual capacity as such will become effective without the consent of the Collateral Trustee or such Secured Debt Representative, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (1), but subject to clauses (2) and (3) above: (1) any Security Document that secures Junior Lien Obligations (but not Parity Lien Obligations) may be amended or supplemented with the approval of the Collateral Trustee acting as directed in writing by the Required Junior Lien Debtholders, unless such amendment or supplement would not be permitted under the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement or the other Parity Lien Documents; and (2) any amendment or waiver of, or any consent under, any provision of the Collateral Trust Agreement or any other Security Document that secures Parity Lien Obligations (except any such amendment, waiver or consent that releases Collateral with respect to which any consent of holders of Junior Lien Debt is required pursuant to the Collateral Trust Agreement, which will be governed by the provisions set forth above) will apply automatically to any comparable provision of any comparable Junior Lien Document without the consent of or notice to any holder of Junior Lien Obligations and without any action by EFIH or any Holder of Notes or holder of other Junior Lien Obligations. Voting In connection with any matter under the Collateral Trust Agreement requiring a vote of holders of Secured Lien Debt, each Series of Secured Lien Debt will cast its votes in accordance with the Secured Debt Documents governing such Series of Secured Lien Debt. The amount of Secured Lien Debt to be voted by a Series of Secured Lien Debt will equal (1) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Secured Lien Debt held by such Series of Secured Lien Debt (including outstanding letters of credit whether or not then available or drawn), plus (2) the aggregate unfunded commitments to extend credit which, when funded, would constitute Indebtedness of such Series of Secured Lien Debt. Following and in accordance with the outcome of the applicable vote under its Secured Debt Documents, the Secured Debt Representative of each Series of Secured Lien Debt will vote the total amount of Secured Lien Debt under that Series of Secured Lien Debt as a block in respect of any vote under the Collateral Trust Agreement. 34 Table of Contents Provisions of the Indenture Relating to Security Equal and Ratable Sharing of Collateral by Holders of Parity Lien Debt The Indenture provides that, notwithstanding: (1) anything contained in the Collateral Trust Agreement or in any other Security Documents; (2) the time of incurrence of any Series of Parity Lien Debt; (3) the order or method of attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any Series of Parity Lien Debt; (4) the time or order of filing or recording of financing statements or other documents filed or recorded to perfect any Parity Lien upon any Collateral; (5) the time of taking possession or control over any Collateral; (6) that any Parity Lien may not have been perfected or may be or have become subordinated, by equitable subordination or otherwise, to any other Lien; or (7) the rules for determining priority under any law governing relative priorities of Liens, all Parity Liens granted at any time by EFIH will secure, equally and ratably, all present and future Parity Lien Obligations. The foregoing section is intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable as a third party beneficiary by, each present and future holder of Parity Lien Obligations, each present and future Parity Lien Representative and the Collateral Trustee as holder of Parity Liens. Ranking of Parity Liens The Indenture requires the Junior Lien Documents, if any, to provide that, notwithstanding: (1) anything to the contrary contained in the Security Documents; (2) the time of incurrence of any Series of Parity Lien Debt; (3) the order or method of attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any Series of Parity Lien Debt; (4) the time or order of filing or recording of financing statements or other documents filed or recorded to perfect any Lien upon any Collateral; (5) the time of taking possession or control over any Collateral; (6) that any Parity Lien may not have been perfected or may be or have become subordinated, by equitable subordination or otherwise, to any other Lien; or (7) the rules for determining priority under any law governing relative priorities of Liens, all Junior Liens at any time granted by EFIH will be subject and subordinate to all Parity Liens securing Parity Lien Obligations. 35 Table of Contents The Indenture also requires the Junior Lien Documents, if any, to provide that the provisions described in the foregoing clauses (1) through (7) are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable as a third party beneficiary by, each present and future holder of Parity Lien Obligations, each present and future Parity Lien Representative and the Collateral Trustee as holder of Parity Liens. Relative Rights The Indenture requires that nothing in the Junior Lien Documents will: (1) impair, as between EFIH and the Holders of the Notes, the obligation of EFIH to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms or any other obligation of EFIH under the Indenture; (2) affect the relative rights of Holders of Notes as against any other creditors of EFIH (other than holders of Junior Liens or other Parity Liens); (3) restrict the right of any Holder of Notes to sue for payments that are then due and owing (but not enforce any judgment in respect thereof against any Collateral to the extent specifically prohibited by the provisions described under Security for the NotesEnforcement of Liens or Security for the NotesInsolvency or Liquidation Proceedings); (4) restrict or prevent any Holder of Notes or holder of other Parity Lien Obligations, the Collateral Trustee or any other Person from exercising any of its rights or remedies upon a Default or Event of Default not specifically restricted or prohibited by the provisions described under Security for the NotesEnforcement of Liens or Security for the NotesInsolvency or Liquidation Proceedings; or (5) restrict or prevent any Holder of Notes or holder of other Parity Lien Obligations, the Trustee, the Collateral Trustee or any other Person from taking any lawful action in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding not specifically restricted or prohibited by the provisions described under Security for the NotesEnforcement of Liens or Security for the NotesInsolvency or Liquidation Proceedings. Further Assurances The Indenture and the Security Documents provide that EFIH, at its own expense, will do or cause to be done all acts and things that may be required, or that the Collateral Trustee from time to time may reasonably request, to assure and confirm that the Collateral Trustee holds, for the benefit of the Secured Debt Representatives and holders of Secured Debt Obligations, duly created and enforceable and perfected Liens upon the Collateral (including any property or assets that are acquired or otherwise become Collateral after the Notes are issued), in each case, as contemplated by, and with the Lien priority required under, the Secured Debt Documents. Upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Trustee or any Secured Debt Representative at any time and from time to time, EFIH, at its own expense, will promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver such security documents, instruments, certificates, notices and other documents, and take such other actions as may be reasonably required, or that the Collateral Trustee may reasonably request, to create, perfect, protect, assure or enforce the Liens and benefits intended to be conferred, in each case as contemplated by the Secured Debt Documents for the benefit of the holders of Secured Debt Obligations. 36 Table of Contents Impairment of Security Interest The Pledge Agreement provides that EFIH will not take or omit to take any action which would or could reasonably be expected to have the result of materially adversely affecting or impairing the Liens in favor of the Collateral Trustee, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral. EFIH shall not grant to any Person, or permit any Person to retain (other than the Collateral Trustee), any interest whatsoever in the Collateral, other than pursuant to clause (3) of the definition of Permitted Liens. EFIH and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement that requires the proceeds received from any sale of Collateral to be applied to repay, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire any Indebtedness of any Person, other than as permitted by the Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents. EFIH shall, at its sole cost and expense, execute and deliver all such agreements and instruments as necessary, or as the Trustee shall reasonably request, to more fully or accurately describe the assets and property intended to be Collateral or the obligations intended to be secured by the Pledge Agreement or any other Security Document. After-Acquired Property Promptly following the acquisition by EFIH of any Equity Interests in any Oncor Subsidiary or any Indebtedness of, or other Investments in, any Oncor Subsidiary or any property or assets required to be pledged as Collateral pursuant to the covenant described under Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales or any Equity Interests in or any Indebtedness of, or other Investments in, any Successor Oncor Business, EFIH will execute and deliver such security instruments, pledges, financing statements and certificates and opinions of counsel as shall be reasonably necessary to vest in the Collateral Trustee a perfected first-priority security interest in such Equity Interests, Indebtedness or other Investments or property or assets and to have such Equity Interests, Indebtedness or other Investments or property or assets added to the Collateral and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such Equity Interests, Indebtedness or other Investments or property or assets to the same extent and with the same force and effect. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control The Notes provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under Optional Redemption and will redeem all of the outstanding Notes pursuant thereto, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the  Change of Control Offer ) at a price in cash (the  Change of Control Payment ) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register with a copy to the Trustee or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled Change of Control and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the  Change of Control Payment Date ); (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled Option of Holder to Elect Purchase on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; 37 Table of Contents (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a telegram, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) that the Holders whose Notes are being repurchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and (8) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with the covenant described under this Repurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control section, that a Holder must follow. Any proceeds received by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries from a sale, conveyance or disposition of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets that constitutes a Change of Control shall be subject to a perfected security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Debt Obligations until consummation of the Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. Other agreements relating to Senior Indebtedness to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under such agreements, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the applicable indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the applicable indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the applicable indebtedness being declared due and payable and could cause any Receivables Facility to be wound down. Additionally, the terms of the Notes and certain series of EFH Corp.s debt, including debt guaranteed by EFIH, provide that certain change of control events (including a Change of Control under the Indenture) would result in EFH Corp. being required to offer to purchase such debt. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. 38 Table of Contents The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us or EFH Corp. and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. As discussed above, a change in control of EFIH would require regulatory approval by the PUCT under the public interest standard and, through October 10, 2012, the PUCT order. As of the Issue Date, we have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control and we are not aware of any such transaction being contemplated by EFH Corp., although it is possible that we or EFH Corp. could decide to engage in such a transaction in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain CovenantsLiens. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of Change of Control includes, subject to certain exceptions, a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Asset Sales The Indenture provides that EFIH will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless: (1) EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by EFIH) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2)(A) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) except in the case of an Asset Sale of Collateral, any liabilities (as shown on EFIHs or such Restricted Subsidiarys most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto) of EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or that are owed to EFIH or an Affiliate of EFIH, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which EFIH and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all applicable creditors in writing, (b) any securities received by the EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale, and 39 Table of Contents (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 5% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value; provided that the aggregate fair market value of Designated Non-cash Consideration received by EFIH after the Issue Date in respect of Asset Sales of Collateral shall not exceed $400.0 million, shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this clause (A) and for no other purpose; and (B) any consideration received by EFIH from an Asset Sale of Collateral shall be concurrently pledged as Collateral for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes and holders of the other Secured Debt Obligations; provided that to the extent such consideration is received by EFIH in cash, it shall be held in an Asset Sale Cash Collateral Account pending the application of such cash consideration pursuant to this covenant. In respect of Net Proceeds received by EFIH or any Restricted Subsidiary from Asset Sales (other than an Asset Sale of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets), within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any such Asset Sale, EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to repay or prepay Parity Lien Debt of EFIH (other than the Notes) (and, in the case of revolving loans and other similar obligations, permanently reduce the commitment thereunder) on a pro rata basis (including to make Restricted Payments to EFH Corp. to permit EFH Corp. to repay or prepay Indebtedness of EFH Corp. (other than Indebtedness owed to a Subsidiary of EFH Corp.) that is guaranteed by EFIH and constitutes Parity Lien Debt), but only up to an aggregate principal amount equal to such Net Proceeds to be used to repay Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Parity Lien Debt and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all Parity Lien Debt (including the Notes), based on amounts outstanding on the date of closing of such Asset Sale; provided that EFIH shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under Optional Redemption, through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for a Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any; (2) to permanently reduce: (a) Obligations under Senior Indebtedness which is Secured Indebtedness permitted by the Indenture, and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (b) Obligations under other Senior Indebtedness (and to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under Optional Redemption, through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or otherwise by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any; or (c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (or any Affiliate thereof); (3) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other assets, in each of (a), (b) and (c), used or useful in a Similar Business; or 40 Table of Contents (4) to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or another of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) acquisitions of other assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided that, in the case of clauses (3) and (4) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as EFIH, or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an  Acceptable Commitment ) (and reinvest within the later of 450 days from the date of receipt of Net Proceeds and 180 days of receipt of such commitment), and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a  Second Commitment ) within the later of (a) 180 days of such cancellation or termination or (b) the initial 450-day period; provided further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, to the extent that regulatory approval is necessary for an asset purchase or investment, or replacement, repair or restoration on any asset or investment, then EFIH or any Restricted Subsidiary shall have an additional 365 days to apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale in accordance with the preceding paragraph. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales (other than Asset Sales of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of the second preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute  Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, EFIH shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Senior Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (an  Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. EFIH will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 10 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Senior Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, EFIH may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Senior Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness will be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Senior Indebtedness tendered. Additionally, EFIH may, at its option, make an Asset Sale Offer using proceeds from any Asset Sale (other than Asset Sales of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets) at any time after consummation of such Asset Sale; provided that such Asset Sale Offer shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $25.0 million. Upon consummation of such Asset Sale Offer, any Net Proceeds not required to be used to purchase Notes shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds. In respect of Net Proceeds received by EFIH or any Restricted Subsidiary from Asset Sales of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets, within 450 days after the receipt by EFIH or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Net Proceeds of any such Asset Sale, EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to deposit the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale into an Asset Sale Cash Collateral Account that is subject to a perfected security interest for the benefit of the holders of Secured Lien Debt to be held solely for the purpose of repayment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on, and/or to repay, prepay, repurchase or redeem, the Notes and other Parity Lien Obligations as described in the following clauses (1) and (2), 41 Table of Contents (1) to repay or prepay Parity Lien Debt of EFIH (other than the Notes) (and, in the case of revolving loans and other similar obligations, permanently reduce the commitment thereunder) on a pro rata basis (including to make Restricted Payments to EFH Corp. to permit EFH Corp. to repay or prepay Indebtedness of EFH Corp. that is guaranteed by EFIH and constitutes Parity Lien Debt), but only up to an aggregate principal amount equal to such Net Proceeds to be used to repay Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Parity Lien Debt and the denominator of which is the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Parity Lien Debt (including the Notes), in each case based on amounts outstanding on the date of closing of such Asset Sale; provided that EFIH shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under Optional Redemption, through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for a Collateral Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the amount of accrued and unpaid interest, if any; or (2) to repay, repurchase or redeem the Notes as provided under Optional Redemption, through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for a Collateral Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, in the event that regulatory approval is necessary for an Investment in any Oncor Subsidiary, then the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall have an additional 365 days to apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale in accordance with the preceding paragraph. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute  Collateral Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds exceeds $200.0 million, the Issuer and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall make an offer to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Parity Lien Debt, to the holders of such Parity Lien Debt (and if required or permitted by the terms of any Indebtedness of EFH Corp. that is guaranteed by EFIH and constitutes Parity Lien Debt, EFH Corp. may make an offer to all holders of such Indebtedness) (a  Collateral Asset Sale Offer ), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Parity Lien Debt that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Collateral Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will commence a Collateral Asset Sale Offer with respect to Collateral Excess Proceeds within 10 Business Days after the date that Collateral Excess Proceeds exceed $200.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Parity Lien Debt tendered pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer is less than the Collateral Excess Proceeds, EFIH and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture and the terms of such Parity Lien Debt. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Parity Lien Debt surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds, the Notes and such Parity Lien Debt will be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Parity Lien Debt tendered. Additionally, the Issuer (and, if applicable, EFH Corp.) may, at its option, make a Collateral Asset Sale Offer using proceeds from any Asset Sale of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets at any time after consummation of such Asset Sale; provided that such Collateral Asset Sale Offer shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $25.0 million. Upon consummation of such Collateral Asset Sale Offer, any Net Proceeds not required to be used to purchase Notes shall not be deemed Collateral Excess Proceeds and the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Net Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. 42 Table of Contents Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture; provided , however , that any Net Proceeds that represents proceeds of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets shall be deposited and held in an Asset Sale Cash Collateral Account that is subject to a perfected security interest for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes and the holders of the other Secured Debt Obligations pending final application thereof in accordance with this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, final application of Net Proceeds that represent proceeds of Collateral or other Oncor-related Assets includes, without limitation, the consummation of a Collateral Asset Sale Offer. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Selection and Notice If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of the Notes issued by it at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed (a) if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes are listed, (b) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable or (c) by lot or such other similar method in accordance with the procedures of DTC. No Notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of purchase or redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes at such Holders registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. The notice will also state any conditions applicable to a redemption. The Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption but such redemption may be subject to one or more conditions precedent. On and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. Certain Covenants Limitation on Restricted Payments EFIH will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of EFIHs, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger or consolidation other than: (a) dividends or distributions by EFIH payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of EFIH; or (b) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, EFIH or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities; (II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of EFIH or any direct or indirect parent of EFIH, including in connection with any merger or consolidation; 43 Table of Contents (III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness, other than: (a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the covenant described under Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of EFIH to EFH Corp. or any of its subsidiaries which was used by EFIH to pay principal on its Indebtedness); or (b) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase or acquisition; or (IV) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exception thereto) being collectively referred to as  Restricted Payments ), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment: (1) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Restricted Payment Coverage Ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of such Restricted Payment would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00; and (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by EFIH and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1), (2) (with respect to the payment of dividends on Refunding Capital Stock (as defined below) pursuant to clause (b) thereof only), (6)(c), (9), (14) and (18) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without duplication): (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of EFIH for the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning October 11, 2007, to the end of EFIHs most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit;

and (2) at the time of incurrence, EFIH will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs above. Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value and the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture does not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral. Liens EFIH will not, and will not permit EFIH Finance or any Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures obligations under any Indebtedness or any related guarantee, on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless: (1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and any related Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; or (2) in all other cases, the Notes or any Guarantees are equally and ratably secured or are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; 54 Table of Contents except that the foregoing shall not apply to (a) Liens securing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to clause (2) or clause (3) (ii) of the second paragraph under Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; provided that the Notes or any related Guarantee are secured on at least an equal and ratable basis as such Indebtedness, (b) Liens securing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under Credit Facilities, including any letter of credit relating thereto, that was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph under Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and (c) Liens incurred to secure Obligations in respect of any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenant described under Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; provided that, with respect to Liens securing Obligations permitted under this subclause (c), at the time of incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such event for which such calculation is being made shall occur would be no greater than 5.0 to 1.0. Any Lien which is granted to secure the Notes under this covenant shall be discharged at the same time as the discharge of the Lien (other than through the exercise of remedies with respect thereto) that gave rise to the obligation to so secure the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, EFIH will not, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on the Collateral (other than a Permitted Lien described under clause (3) of the definition of Permitted Liens), or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom except: (1) Liens on the Collateral securing up to $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of Parity Lien Debt (including the Notes, any Additional Notes, the EFH Corp.

(m) restrictions created in connection with any Receivables Facility for the benefit of EFIH or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, in the good faith determination of EFIH, are necessary or advisable to effect the transactions contemplated under such Receivables Facility; and (n) restrictions or conditions contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale, hedging or similar agreement to which EFIH or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party entered into in the ordinary course of business; provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance solely to the property or assets of EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject of such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder and/or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of EFIH or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of any other Restricted Subsidiary. 61 Table of Contents Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries EFIH will not permit any of its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt securities of EFIH, EFIH Finance or any Guarantor), other than EFIH Finance, a Guarantor, a Foreign Subsidiary or a Receivables Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of EFIH, EFIH Finance or any Guarantor, unless: (1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer: (a) if the Notes or such Guarantors Guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to such Indebtedness, the Guarantee under the supplemental indenture shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiarys guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness substantially to the same extent as the Notes are subordinated to such Indebtedness; and (b) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and (2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives, and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against EFIH or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee; provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. In the event there is a future Restricted Subsidiary that Guarantees the Notes in accordance with this Limitations of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries covenant, such Guarantor, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, will fully and unconditionally guarantee (and jointly and severally with any other Guarantors), on a senior basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest in respect of the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture. Any entity that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. The obligations of each Guarantor, if any, under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. However, this limitation may not be effective to prevent a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance law, or may reduce or eliminate a Guarantors obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantors liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessIf a court were to find that EFIH were insolvent before or after giving effect to the issuance of the notes in the exchange offers and did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the issuance of the notes or the pledge of the Collateral, the court may void all or a portion of the obligations represented by the notes or the pledge of the Collateral by EFIH as a fraudulent conveyance. 62 Table of Contents In the event there is a future Restricted Subsidiary that Guarantees the Notes in accordance with this Limitations of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries covenant, any such Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) (a) any sale, exchange or transfer (by merger, consolidation, wind-up or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or sale of all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor, which sale, exchange or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (b) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee; (c) the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; or (d) the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance or the discharge of the Issuers obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; and (2) such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. Limitations on Business Activities of EFIH Finance EFIH Finance may not hold assets, become liable for any obligations or engage in any business activities; provided that it may be a co-obligor with respect to the Notes or any other Indebtedness issued by EFIH and may engage in any activities directly related thereto or necessary in connection therewith. EFIH Finance shall be a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of EFIH at all times. Reports and Other Information Notwithstanding that EFIH may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Indenture requires EFIH to file with the SEC (and make available to the Trustee and Holders of the Notes (without exhibits), without cost to any Holder, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC) from and after the Issue Date, (1) within 90 days (or any other time period then in effect under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act with respect to the filing of a Form 10-K by a non-accelerated filer) after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form, containing the information required to be contained therein, or required in such successor or comparable form; (2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports on Form 10-Q containing all quarterly information that would be required to be contained in Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form; (3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other reports on Form 8-K, or any successor or comparable form; and (4) any other information, documents and other reports which EFIH would be required to file with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 63 Table of Contents in each case in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form; provided that EFIH shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which event EFIH will make available such information to prospective purchasers of Notes, in addition to providing such information to the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, in each case within 15 days after the time EFIH would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of EFIH becomes a Guarantor of the Notes, the Indenture permits EFIH to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to EFIH by furnishing financial information relating to such parent; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to EFIH and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, EFIH will not be deemed to have failed to comply with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under Events of Default and Remedies until 60 days after the date any report hereunder is due. Events of Default and Remedies The Indenture provides that each of the following is an  Event of Default : (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) contained in the Indenture, the Notes or the Security Documents relating to the Notes; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by EFIH or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by EFIH or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to EFIH or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $250.0 million or more at any one time outstanding; (5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $250.0 million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; 64 Table of Contents (6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary); (7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture; or (8) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of $250.0 million in the aggregate, any security interest and Lien purported to be created by any Security Document with respect to the Collateral (a) ceases to be in full force and effect, (b) ceases to give the Collateral Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, the Liens, rights, powers and privileges purported to be created and granted thereby (including a perfected first-priority security interest in and Lien on, all of the Collateral thereunder) in favor of the Collateral Trustee, or (c) is asserted by EFIH not to be, a valid, perfected, first priority (except as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture or the Collateral Trust Agreement) security interest in or Lien on the Collateral covered thereby. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In addition, the Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interest of the Holders of the Notes. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Collateral Trust Agreement except as provided in such documents. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (2) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee thereunder, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; 65 Table of Contents (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture provides that EFIH is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and EFIH is required, within five Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default. No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their parent companies (other than the Issuer and the Guarantors) shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees, the Indenture or any Security Document or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting the Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor under the Indenture will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes and have the Issuers and each Guarantors obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee ( Legal Defeasance ) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for: (1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture; (2) the Issuers obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust; (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers obligations in connection therewith; and (4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture. 66 Table of Contents In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each Guarantor released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture ( Covenant Defeasance ) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under Events of Default and Remedies will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes: (1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes, and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; (2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (b) since the issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit; (5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith); (6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to customary assumptions and exclusions following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code; 67 Table of Contents (7) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and (8) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with. The Collateral will be released from the Lien securing the Notes, as provided under Security for the NotesRelease of Security Interests, upon a Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance in accordance with the provisions described in this Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance section. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes, when either: (1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable within one year or may be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; (b) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) with respect to the Indenture or the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit, and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith); (c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and (d) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. The Collateral will be released from the Lien securing the Notes, as provided under Security for the NotesRelease of Security Interests, upon a discharge of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions described in this Satisfaction and Discharge section. 68 Table of Contents Amendment, Supplement and Waiver Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Notes and the Security Documents relating to the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the outstanding Notes, and any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes issued thereunder or any Guarantee or the Security Documents relating to the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes). The Indenture provides that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder: (1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or alter or waive the provisions with respect to the redemption of such Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions described under Repurchase at the Option of Holders are not redemptions of Notes); (3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note; (4) waive a Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee which cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all Holders; (5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated therein; (6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes; (7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions; (8) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, or interest on such Holders Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holders Notes; (9) make any change to or modify the ranking provisions of the Indenture or the Notes that would adversely affect the Holders; or (10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantees of any Significant Subsidiary in any manner adverse to the Holders of the Notes. In addition, without the consent of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not modify any Security Document relating to the Notes or the provisions of the Indenture dealing with the Security Documents or application of trust moneys in any manner materially adverse to the Holders other than in accordance with the Indenture and the Security Documents. Without the consent of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment, supplement or waiver may modify the Security Documents to release all or substantially all of the Collateral. Without the consent of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment, supplement or waiver may modify the Security Documents to release less than all or substantially all of the Collateral. 69 Table of Contents Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Notes or any Security Document without the consent of any Holder to; (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency; (2) provide for uncertificated Notes of such series in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; (3) comply with the covenant relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; (4) provide for the assumption of the Issuers or any Guarantors obligations to the Holders; (5) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder; (6) add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Guarantor; (7) comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; (8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof; (9) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes; (10) add a Guarantor under the Indenture; (11) conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Notes or any Security Document to any provision of this Description of the Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of the Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, any Guarantees, the Notes or any Security Document; (12) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and administration of the Notes; provided , however , that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes; (13) mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, as security for the payment and performance of all or any portion of the Obligations, in any property or assets; or (14) provide for the accession or succession of any parties to the Security Documents (and other amendments that are administrative or ministerial in nature) in connection with an amendment, renewal, extension, substitution, refinancing, restructuring, replacement, supplementing or other modification from time to time of any agreement or action that is not prohibited by the Indenture, including to add any additional secured parties to the extent not prohibited by the Indenture. The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. 70 Table of Contents Notices Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing. Concerning the Trustee The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The global notes have been deposited with the applicable registrar as custodian for the Depository Trust Company (DTC), and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case, for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for definitive notes in registered certificated form (certificated notes) except in the limited circumstances described below. See Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes. Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the global notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form. Transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (Euroclear), and Clearstream Banking, Société Anonyme (Clearstream, Luxembourg)), which may change from time to time. Depository Procedures The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the Participants) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTCs system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the Indirect Participants). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:  DTC will credit portions of the principal amount of the global notes to the accounts of the Participants; and  ownership of these interests in the global notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the global notes). Investors in the global notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the global notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg) that are Participants. All interests in a global note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a global note to pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. 109 Table of Contents Except as described below, owners of interests in the global notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the indenture governing the notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a global note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture governing the notes. Under the terms of the indenture, we, the trustee, the registrar, the paying agent and the transfer agent (together with the registrar and the paying agent, the agents) will treat the persons in whose names the notes, including the global notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we, the trustee, the agents nor any agent of ours or theirs has or will have any responsibility or liability for:  any aspect of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the global notes; or  any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be our responsibility or the responsibility of DTC or either trustee. Neither we, the trustee nor the agents will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and we, the trustee and the agents may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Except for trades involving only Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg participants, interests in the global notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTCs Same Day Funds Settlement System and secondary market trading activity in such interests will, therefore, settle in immediately available funds, subject in all cases to the rules and procedures of DTC and its Participants. See Same Day Settlement and Payment. Transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTCs procedures and will be settled in same day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTCs rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by its respective depositary. However, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream, Luxembourg participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. 110 Table of Contents DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the global notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the global notes for legended notes in certificated form and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither we nor the trustee nor any of our or its agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes A global note is exchangeable for certificated notes if:  DTC (1) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global notes or (2) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, we fail to appoint a successor depositary; or  there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to the notes. In addition, beneficial interests in a global note may be exchanged for certificated notes upon prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture governing the notes. In all cases, certificated notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interests in global notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). Same Day Settlement and Payment The Issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the global notes (including principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee. The Issuer will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to certificated notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the certificated notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holders registered address. The notes represented by the global notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTCs Same Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time-zone differences, credits of interests in the global notes received in Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC Participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions involving interests in such global notes settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear participants on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear as a result of sales of interests in the global notes by or through a Clearstream, Luxembourg participant or a Euroclear participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC. 111 Table of Contents MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income and, in the case of Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below), estate tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes as of the date of this prospectus. This summary is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code (the Regulations), and administrative rulings and judicial decisions, in each case as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively, resulting in U.S. federal tax consequences materially different from those summarized below. We have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:  a dealer in securities or currencies;  a financial institution;  a regulated investment company;  a real estate investment trust;  a tax-exempt organization;  an insurance company;  a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle;  a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for securities;  a person liable for alternative minimum tax;  a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes;  a U.S. holder whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;  a controlled foreign corporation;  a passive foreign investment company; or  a United States expatriate. This summary assumes that the notes will be held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not address the tax considerations arising under the laws of any foreign, state or local jurisdiction or, except as expressly provided below, U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws. For purposes of this discussion, the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of the notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust, if its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if it has made a valid election in effect under applicable Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. 112 Table of Contents For purpose of this discussion, the term Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of the notes (other than a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. Holder. If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner of a partnership holding notes, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of notes. THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO BE, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY PARTICULAR HOLDER. YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF NON-INCOME TAX LAWS AND THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION, TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION. Material Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S Holders of the notes. Payments of Stated Interest The stated interest payments on the notes will generally be taxed to you as ordinary income at the time paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Market Discount If you purchase a note for an amount that is less than its stated principal amount, the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless that difference is less than a specified de minimis amount. Any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the note, unless you elect to accrue on a constant interest method. Under the market discount rules, you will be required to treat any principal payment on, or any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of, a note as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that you have not previously included in income and are treated as having accrued on the note at the time of the payment or disposition. In addition, you may be required to defer, until the maturity of the note or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction, the deduction of all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness attributable to the note. You may elect, on a note-by-note basis, to deduct the deferred interest expense in a tax year prior to the year of disposition. You should consult your own tax advisors before making this election. You may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues, on either a ratable or constant interest method, in which case the rule described above regarding deferral of interest deductions will not apply. Amortizable Bond Premium If you purchase a note for an amount in excess of its stated principal amount, you will be considered to have purchased a note at a premium. You generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of the note on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under your regular accounting method. If you do not elect to amortize bond premium, that premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss you would otherwise recognize on disposition of the note. 113 Table of Contents Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes You will generally recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note (including potentially upon a Permitted Asset Transfer) in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received (less an amount attributable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxed in the manner described above under the subheading Payments of Stated Interest) and (ii) your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note will generally be your initial tax basis in such note, increased by any market discount previously included in income, and reduced by any amortized bond premium. Except as described above with respect to market discount, any gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have a holding period of more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. Long-term capital gain recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders is generally eligible for a reduced rate of taxation and the deduction of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Material Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences to Non-U.S. holders of the notes. Payments of Interest A Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to tax on any payment of interest on the notes under the portfolio interest rule, provided that (i) such interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is not attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment); (ii) you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of EFH Corp.s voting stock within the meaning of the Code and the Regulations; (iii) you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to EFH Corp. actually or constructively through stock ownership; (iv) you are not a bank receiving interest on a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and (v) you have provided a validly completed IRS Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form) establishing your Non-U.S. Holder status (or you satisfied certain documentary evidence requirements for establishing such Non-U.S. Holder status). If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest on the notes made to you will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless you provide EFH Corp. (or its paying agent) with a properly executed (i) IRS Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or (ii) IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment that you maintain), then you will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis generally in the same manner as if you were a U.S. Holder unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise (although you will be exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, provided the certification requirements discussed above are satisfied). In addition, if you are a corporate Non-U.S. Holder, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your earnings, including such interest, subject to adjustments. Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes Any gain realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:  The gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment); or 114 Table of Contents  You are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition, and certain other conditions are met. If a Non-U.S. Holder of notes is described in the first bullet point above, any gain recognized upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same manner as effectively connected interest as described above. If a Non-U.S. Holder of notes is described in the second bullet point above, any gain recognized upon a sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of the notes will be subject to U.S. federal income tax a statutory rate of 30%, which gain may be offset by certain losses. U.S. Federal Estate Tax Your estate will not be subject to U.S. federal estate tax on notes beneficially owned by you at the time of your death, provided that any payment to you on the notes would be eligible for exemption from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax under the portfolio interest rule described above under Payments of Interest without regard to the statement requirement described in clause (v) of that section. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting U.S. Holders In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments of interest on, or proceeds from a disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of, the notes (unless, in each case, the holder is an exempt recipient such as a corporation). Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders Generally, EFH Corp. must report to the IRS and to each Non-U.S. Holder the amount of interest paid to such Non-U.S. Holder with respect to the notes, and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to such payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which such Non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or information exchange agreement. In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to interest that EFH Corp. pays to you on the notes, provided that EFH Corp. does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code, and you have provided a validly completed IRS Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form) establishing that you are a Non-U.S. Holder (or you satisfy certain documentary evidence requirements for establishing that you are a Non-U.S. Holder). Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds of a sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of notes made within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the payor under penalties of perjury that you are a Non-U.S. Holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person as defined under the Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 115 Table of Contents CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), individual retirement accounts and other plans and arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws, rules or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, Similar Laws) and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include plan assets of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a Plan). This summary is based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code (and related regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations) as of the date of this prospectus. This summary does not purport to be complete and future legislation, court decisions, administrative regulations, rulings or administrative pronouncements could significantly modify the requirements summarized below. Any of these changes may be retroactive and may thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. General Fiduciary Matters ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a Benefit Plan) and both ERISA and the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Benefit Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Benefit Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Benefit Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Benefit Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Benefit Plan. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should consult with its counsel in order to determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law. In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciarys duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Prohibited Transaction Issues Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Benefit Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are parties in interest, within the meaning of ERISA, or disqualified persons, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Benefit Plan that engaged in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by a Benefit Plan with respect to which EFIH, EFH Corp., a guarantor or the Market Maker are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (PTCEs) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance of these or any other PTCE should carefully review the PTCE to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. 116 Table of Contents Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing plan assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding are entitled to exemptive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar Laws. Representation Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, or any interest therein, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the notes constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the notes by such purchaser or transferee are entitled to exemptive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering acquiring the notes (and holding the notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investments and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. 117 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION This prospectus is to be used by the Market Maker and its affiliates in connection with offers and sales of the notes in market-making transactions in the secondary market effected from time to time. The Market Maker and its affiliates may act as principal or agent in such transactions, including as agent for the counterparty when acting as principal or as agent for both counterparties, and may receive compensation in the form of discounts and commissions, including from both counterparties, when it acts as agents for both. Such sales will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at prices related thereto or at negotiated prices. We will not receive any of the proceeds from such sales. From time to time, the Market Maker and its affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide from time to time, investment banking and commercial banking services and financial advisory services to us for which they have in the past received, and may in the future receive, customary fees. In addition, the Market Maker and certain of its affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide from time to time, certain investment banking and commercial banking services and financial advisory services for certain of our subsidiaries, for EFH Corp. and certain of its affiliates and for the members of the Sponsor Group and certain of their affiliates, for which they have received, or will receive, customary fees. The Market Maker is one of the members of the Sponsor Group. The Sponsor Group indirectly owns approximately 60% of our capital stock on a fully-diluted basis through its investment in Texas Holdings, which owns approximately 99% of the capital stock of EFH Corp., our parent company. Affiliates of the Market Maker may be deemed, as a result of their ownership of approximately 27% of the General Partners outstanding units and certain provisions of the General Partners Limited Liability Company Agreement, to have shared voting or dispositive power over Texas Holdings. Each of Scott Lebovitz, Kenneth Pontarelli and Thomas Ferguson, who are members of EFH Corp.s board of directors, are employees of the Market Maker or its affiliates. An affiliate of the Market Maker is a co-documentation agent, joint lead arranger and joint lead bookrunner for, and a lender under, Oncors revolving credit facility and TCEHs senior secured credit facilities. This affiliate is also the sole lead arranger, sole bookrunner and posting agent for TCEHs commodity collateral posting facility. The Market Maker acted as dealer manager for the offers to purchase and consent solicitations with respect to $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of EFH Corp.s outstanding 4.80% Series O Senior Notes due 2009, $250 million in aggregate principal amount of TCEHs outstanding 6.125% Senior Notes due 2008 and $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of TCEHs outstanding 7.000% Senior Notes due 2013. The Market Maker acted as an initial purchaser in connection with the original offering and sale of the EFH Corp. 2017 Notes and the TCEH 2015/2016 Notes in October 2007, and received a customary discount in connection with those transactions. In addition, the Market Maker acted as an initial purchaser in connection with the offering and sale of the EFH Corp. 2020 Notes in January 2010, and received a customary discount in connection with that transaction. The Market Maker acted as a dealer manager for the exchange offers and consent solicitations with respect to the notes and the EFH Corp. 2019 Notes. The Market Maker and/or its affiliates currently own, and may from time to time trade, the notes for their own accounts in connection with their principal activities. Such sales may be made pursuant to this prospectus or otherwise pursuant to an applicable exemption from registration. Additionally, in the future, the Market Maker and/or its affiliates may, from time to time, own notes as a result of market-making activities. We have been advised by the Market Maker that, subject to applicable laws and regulations, the Market Maker or its affiliates currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, the Market Maker is not obligated to do so, and any such market-making may be interrupted or discontinued at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that an active trading market will be sustained. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Notes and Our Substantial IndebtednessYour ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no assurance that any active trading market will develop for the notes. 118 Table of Contents We have agreed to indemnify the Market Maker against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and pay all expenses in connection with the performance of our obligations relating to the market-making activities of the Market Maker and its affiliates. 119 Table of Contents LEGAL MATTERS The validity and enforceability of the notes have been passed upon for us by Andrew M.

B-4 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION EFIH and EFIH Finances executive officers are comprised of executive officers of EFIHs parent company, EFH Corp. Consequently, all of EFIH and EFIH Finances named executive officers are also named executive officers of EFH Corp. All compensation matters, including compensation philosophy, are administered by EFH Corp. As a result, set forth below is substantially the same executive compensation disclosure publicly filed with the SEC by EFH Corp. on February 19, 2010 in EFH Corp.s Annual Report of Form 10-K (the EFH Corp. Form 10-K). Organization and Compensation Committee The Organization and Compensation Committee (the O&C Committee) of EFH Corp.s Board of Directors (the Board) is comprised of four non-employee directors: Arcilia C. Acosta, Donald L. Evans, Marc S. Lipschultz and Kenneth Pontarelli. The primary responsibility of the O&C Committee is to:  determine and oversee the compensation program of EFH Corp. and its subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities), including making recommendations to the Board with respect to the adoption, amendment or termination of compensation and benefits plans, arrangements, policies and practices;  evaluate the performance of EFH Corp.s Chief Executive Officer (the CEO) and the other executive officers of EFH Corp. and its subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities) (collectively, the executive officers), including all of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (the Named Executive Officers), and  approve executive compensation based on those evaluations. Compensation Discussion and Analysis Compensation of the CEO In determining the compensation of the CEO, the O&C Committee annually follows a thorough and detailed process. At the end of each year, the O&C Committee reviews a self-assessment prepared by the CEO regarding his performance and the performance of our businesses and meets (with and without the CEO) to evaluate and discuss his performance and the performance of our businesses. In addition to conducting an annual review of the CEOs performance, the O&C Committee periodically uses independent compensation consultants to assess the compensation of the CEO against a variety of market reference points and competitive data, including the compensation practices of a number of companies that we consider to comprise our peer group, size-adjusted energy services industry survey data and size-adjusted general industry survey data. While the O&C Committee tries to ensure that the bulk of the CEOs compensation is directly linked to his performance and the performance of our businesses, the O&C Committee also seeks to set his compensation in the manner that is competitive for retention purposes. The last assessment of the CEOs compensation was performed in late 2009 / early 2010, when the O&C Committee engaged Towers Watson to perform a competitive analysis of the CEOs compensation. In January 2010, Towers Watson delivered its report to the O&C Committee, which report included market data for a peer group composed of the following companies: AES Corporation Allegheny Energy, Inc. Ameren Corp. American Electric Power Co. Inc, Calpine Corp. Constellation Energy Group Inc. Dominion Resources Inc. Duke Energy Corp. Edison International Entergy Corp. Exelon Corp. FirstEnergy Corp. FPL Group Inc. Mirant Corp. NRG Energy, Inc. PPL Corp. Progress Energy Inc. Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. RRI Energy Inc. Southern Co. Xcel Energy Inc. The data for CEO compensation of the peer group was developed at both the 50th and 75th percentiles of market in order to provide the O&C Committee with a broad market view and multiple benchmarks. The O&C Committee targets total direct compensation around the 75 th percentile of the peer group. B-5 Table of Contents While the O&C Committee considers market reference points and competitive data in determining the appropriate compensation of the CEO (and the other executive officers), the O&C Committee also considers qualitative and subjective factors that are more specific to EFH Corp. in making such determinations. One such factor is the fact that EFH Corp. is a highly-leveraged, privately-owned company. In this regard, while executive officers of publicly traded energy companies, including those in our peer group, are typically granted smaller long-term equity incentive awards on an annual basis, our executive officers received one-time, up front grants of long-term equity incentive awards intended to cover a multi-year period. Extended periods of economic strength or weakness generally has less affect on the cumulative value of annual awards as compared to one-time, up front awards because the annual awards are typically granted at fair market value over time. Accordingly, one-time, up front awards are typically riskier than annual awards. After a comprehensive review of the CEOs performance and the performance of our businesses in 2009, and taking into consideration the Towers Watson report, the economic dislocation occurring over the last 18 months and other qualitative and subjective factors as described above, the O&C Committee approved several changes to the compensation arrangement for the CEO in February 2010. The O&C Committee made these changes to provide incentives for retention and performance and to maintain a strong alignment between the CEO and our shareholders. We believe these changes are consistent with our compensation philosophy as described below. Compensation of Other Executive Officers In determining whether to make any adjustments to the compensation of any of our executive officers (other than the CEO), the O&C Committee seeks the input of the CEO. At the end of each year, the CEO reviews a self-assessment prepared by each of these executive officers and assesses the executive officers performance against business unit and individual goals and objectives. The O&C Committee and the CEO then review the CEOs assessments and, in that context, the O&C Committee approves any adjustments to the compensation for each of these executive officers. In addition to these annual reviews/assessments, the CEO periodically assesses the compensation of each of these executive officers. The last assessment of the compensation of the executive officers by the CEO was performed in the second half of 2009. Following that assessment, and taking into consideration the economic dislocation occurring over the last 18 months and other qualitative and subjective factors as described above, the CEO suggested several changes to the compensation arrangements for certain of our executive officers in order to provide incentives for retention and performance and to maintain alignment between our executive officers and shareholders. These changes, which are described in more detail below, were approved by the O&C Committee in October 2009 with respect to such executive officers, including each of Messrs. Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke. We believe these changes are consistent with our compensation philosophy as described below. Compensation Philosophy We have a pay-for-performance compensation philosophy, which places an emphasis on pay-at-risk. In other words, a significant portion of an executive officers compensation is comprised of variable, at-risk incentive compensation. Our compensation program is intended to compensate executive officers appropriately for their contribution to the attainment of our financial, operational and strategic objectives. In addition, we believe it is important to retain our executive officers and strongly align their interests with EFH Corp.s shareholders by emphasizing long-term incentive compensation, including equity-based compensation. To achieve our compensation philosophy, we believe that:  compensation plans should balance both long-term and short-term objectives;  the overall compensation program should emphasize variable compensation elements that have a direct link to overall corporate performance and shareholder value, and  an executive officers individual compensation level should be based upon an evaluation of the financial and operational performance of that executive officers business unit as well as the executive officers individual performance. B-6 Table of Contents We believe our compensation philosophy supports our businesses by:  aligning performance measures with our business objectives to drive the financial and operational performance of EFH Corp. and its business units;  rewarding business unit and individual performance by providing compensation levels consistent with the level of contribution and degree of accountability;  attracting and retaining the best performers, and  strengthening the correlation between the long-term interests of our executive officers and shareholders. Elements of Compensation The material elements of our executive compensation program are:  a base salary;  the opportunity to earn an annual performance-based cash bonus based on the achievement of specific corporate, business unit and individual performance goals, and  long-term incentive awards, primarily in the form of (i) long-term cash incentive awards and (ii) options to purchase shares of EFH Corp.s common stock (the Stock Option Awards) under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of EFH Corp. and Affiliates (the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan). In addition, executive officers generally have the opportunity to participate in certain of our broad-based employee compensation plans, including our Thrift (401(k)) Plan, retirement plans and non-qualified benefit plans, and to receive certain perquisites. Assessment of Compensation Elements We design the majority of an executive officers compensation to be directly linked to corporate and business unit performance. For example, an executive officers annual performance-based cash bonus is primarily based on the achievement of certain corporate and business unit financial and operational targets (such as management EBITDA, cost management, generation output and customer satisfaction). In addition, the vesting of a portion of each executive officers Stock Option Awards is contingent upon the attainment of certain management EBITDA targets. We also try to ensure that our executive compensation program is competitive in order to reduce the risk of losing our executive officers. The following is a detailed discussion of the principal compensation elements provided to our executive officers. More detail about each of the elements can be found in the compensation tables, including the footnotes to the tables, and the narrative discussion following certain of the tables. Base Salary Base salary should reward executive officers for the scope and complexity of their position and the level of responsibility required. We believe that a competitive level of base salary is required to attract and retain qualified talent. The O&C Committee annually reviews base salaries and periodically uses independent compensation consultants to ensure the base salaries are market-competitive. The O&C Committee may also review an executive officers base salary from time to time during a year, including if the executive officer is given a promotion or if his responsibilities are significantly increased. We want to ensure our cash compensation is competitive and sufficient to incent executive officers to remain with us, recognizing our high performance expectations across a broad set of operational, financial, customer service and community-oriented goals and objectives and the higher risk levels associated with being a significantly-leveraged company. B-7 Table of Contents In light of the significant market dislocation and uncertainty that began in late 2008 and continued into 2009, our Named Executive Officers base salaries for 2009 remained unchanged from 2008 levels. In October 2009, the O&C Committee approved an increase in the base salary, effective January 1, 2010, for each of the Named Executive Officers, with the exception of Messrs. Young and Burke. In February 2010, the O&C Committee approved an increase in the base salary of each of Messrs. Young and Burke, which increases took effect retroactively on January 1, 2010. These increases reflect, in part, that none of the Named Executive Officers received a salary increase for 2009. The following table indicates the Named Executive Officers base salaries for 2008, 2009 and 2010. Name Title 2008 Base Salary 2009 Base Salary Approved 2010 Base Salary John F. Young President and Chief Executive Officer of EFH Corp. $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,200,000 Paul M. Keglevic Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of EFH Corp. $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 650,000 David A. Campbell Chief Executive Officer of Luminant $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 700,000 Robert C.

Burke Chief Executive Officer of TXU Energy $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 630,000 Rizwan Chand (1) Former Executive Vice President - Human Resources of EFH Corp. $ 450,000 $ 450,000 N/A (1) Mr. Chands employment with EFH Corp. terminated in October 2009. Annual Performance-Based Cash BonusExecutive Annual Incentive Plan The Executive Annual Incentive Plan (EAIP) provides an annual performance-based cash bonus for the successful attainment of certain annual financial and operational performance targets that are established annually at each of the corporate and business unit levels by the O&C Committee. Under the terms of the EAIP, performance against these targets, which are generally set at challenging levels to incent high performance, drives bonus funding. Based on the level of attainment of these performance targets, an aggregate EAIP funding percentage amount for all participants is determined. Our financial performance targets typically include management EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. When the O&C Committee reviews management EBITDA for purposes of determining our performance against the applicable management EBITDA target, it includes our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization plus transaction, management and/or similar fees paid to the Sponsor Group, together with such adjustments as the O&C Committee shall determine appropriate in its discretion after good faith consultation with the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer, including adjustments consistent with those included in the comparable definitions in TCEHs Senior Secured Facilities (to the extent considered appropriate for executive compensation purposes). Our management EBITDA targets are also expected to be adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures or major capital investment initiatives to the extent that they were not contemplated in our financial plan (the Financial Plan). The management EBITDA targets are intended to measure achievement of the Financial Plan and the adjustments to management EBITDA described above primarily represent elements of our performance that are either beyond the control of management or were not predictable at the time the Financial Plan was submitted. The O&C Committee has broad authority to make these or any other adjustments to EBITDA that it deems appropriate in connection with its evaluation and compensation of our executive officers. Management EBITDA is an internal measure used only for performance management purposes, and EFH Corp. does not intend for management EBITDA to be an alternative to any measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Management EBITDA is not the same as Adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed elsewhere in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and defined in Annex A to this prospectus.

Management EBITDA (excluding Oncor) 25 % 119 % 30 % Luminant Management EBITDA (excluding 3 new units) 30 % 146 % 44 % Luminant Baseload Generation (excluding 3 new units) 18.75 % 89 % 17 % Luminant O&M/SG&A/Capital Expenditures 15 % 139 % 21 % Luminant Fossil Fuel Costs 7.5 % 75 % 5 % Management EBITDA for 3 new units (excluding capital expenditures) 3.75 % 56 % 2 % Total 100 % 119 % (1) Performance payouts equal 100% if the target amount is achieved for a particular metric, 50% if the threshold amount is achieved and 200% if the superior amount is achieved. The actual performance payouts are interpolated between threshold and target or target and superior, as applicable, with a maximum performance payout for any particular metric being equal to 200%. The following table provides a summary of the performance targets for Mr. Burke, who had primary responsibility at TXU Energy. Performance TargetsTXU Energy Weight Performance (1) Payout EFH Corp. Management EBITDA (excluding Oncor) 25 % 119 % 30 % TXU Energy Management EBITDA 26.25 % 200 % 53 % Contribution Margin 15 % 200 % 30 % TXU Energy Total Costs 15 % 59 % 9 % Upgrades to Customer Care System (Project Spend, PUCT Complaints and Days Meter to Cash) 11.25 % 29 % 3 % Customer Satisfaction 7.5 % 150 % 11 % Total 100 % 136 % (1) Performance payouts equal 100% if the target amount is achieved for a particular metric, 50% if the threshold amount is achieved and 200% if the superior amount is achieved. The actual performance payouts are interpolated between threshold and target or target and superior, as applicable, with a maximum performance payout for any particular metric being equal to 200%. Individual Performance Modifier After approving the actual performance against the applicable targets under the plan, the O&C Committee and/or the CEO reviews the performance of each of our executive officers on an individual and comparative basis. Based on this review, which includes an analysis of both objective and subjective criteria, including the CEOs recommendations (with respect to all executive officers other than himself), the O&C Committee approves an individual modifier for each executive officer. Under the terms of the EAIP for 2009, the individual performance modifier can range from an outstanding rating (200%) to an unacceptable rating (0%). In February 2010, the O&C Committee amended the EAIP to reduce the maximum individual performance modifier applicable for 2010 and beyond from 200% to 150%. To calculate an executive officers final performance-based cash bonus, the executive officers corporate/business unit payout percentages are multiplied by the executive officers target incentive level, which is computed as a percentage of annualized base salary, and then by the executive officers individual performance modifier. B-10 Table of Contents Actual Award The following table provides a summary of the 2009 performance-based cash bonus for each Named Executive Officer (other than Mr. Chand) under the EAIP. Name Target (% of salary) Target Award ($ Value) Actual Award John F. Young (1) 100 % $ 1,000,000 $ 1,469,000 Paul M. Keglevic (2) 75 % $ 450,000 $ 664,200 David A. Campbell (3) 75 % $ 450,000 $ 642,600 Robert C. Walters (4) 75 % $ 431,250 $ 610,000 James A. Burke (5) 75 % $ 450,000 $ 856,800 (1) Mr. Youngs incentive award is based on the successful achievement of the financial performance targets for EFH Corp. and the financial and operational performance targets for Luminant and TXU Energy and an individual performance modifier that increased his incentive award. In 2009, Mr. Young successfully led the company in a difficult year in which sales volumes and demand fell, wholesale power prices declined and the credit markets were at times inaccessible. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Mr. Young created value in many parts of the companys businesses. In particular, Mr. Young led the companys efforts in, among other things: improving operations and safety at our generation and mining operations; participating in the national debate on climate change, green energy and financial reforms; bringing online two new lignite-fueled generation units on time and budget; implementing substantial and lasting cost reductions; exceeding EFH Corp.s planned EBITDA for 2009; and strengthening the companys management team. Given these and other significant achievements, the O&C Committee approved an individual performance modifier that increased Mr. Youngs incentive award. (2) Mr. Keglevics incentive award is based on the successful achievement of the financial performance targets for EFH Corp. and EFH Business Services and the financial and operational performance targets for Luminant and TXU Energy and an individual performance modifier that increased his incentive award. In 2009, Mr. Keglevic successfully implemented several new financial processes at EFH Corp. and its business units, including processes for understanding, managing and communicating the financial and operational performance of our businesses, managing the varied risks of our businesses and preserving effective liquidity levels. In addition, Mr. Keglevic led the companys liquidity and liability management efforts, including the successful amendment to the TCEH Senior Secured Facilities. Given these significant accomplishments and other achievements (including his installation of a drive for results culture), the O&C Committee approved an individual performance modifier that increased Mr. Keglevics incentive award. (3) Mr. Campbells incentive award is based on the successful achievement of a financial performance target for EFH Corp. and the financial and operational performance targets for Luminant and an individual performance modifier that increased his incentive award. In 2009, Mr. Campbell strengthened the Luminant management team (including, among others, the designation of a new Chief Nuclear Officer and Chief Fossil Officer) while overseeing strong financial and operational results primarily at Luminants nuclear plant and in Luminants wholesale energy organization. Luminants baseload generation construction program also achieved several important milestones, including the substantial completion of the two new lignite-fueled units, at costs and time-to-build schedules that are in the top decile relative to recent industry benchmarks. In addition, under Mr. Campbells leadership, Luminant had a very strong year for safety, with substantially all of its recordable safety metrics being in the top quartile for its industry. Given these significant accomplishments and other achievements (including his focus on developing strategic business solutions and building a team-oriented culture), the O&C Committee approved an individual performance modifier that increased Mr. Campbells incentive award. (4) Mr. Walters incentive award is based on the successful achievement of the financial performance targets for EFH Corp. and EFH Business Services and the financial and operational performance targets for Luminant and TXU Energy and an individual performance modifier that increased his incentive award. In 2009, Mr. Walters successfully managed several significant legal issues of the company. In particular, Mr. Walters led the companys efforts in (i) defending the challenges to the Oak Grove and Sandow 5 construction and operating permits, (ii) negotiating the termination and transition of the companys outsourcing relationship with CapGemini Energy and (iii) settling a dispute with the PUCT regarding alleged market manipulation activities. In addition, Mr. Walters drove improvements in the financial performance of our real estate holdings. Given these significant accomplishments and other achievements (including his strategic contributions in the political and civic arena on a local, state and national level), the O&C Committee approved an individual performance modifier that increased Mr. Walters incentive award. (5) Mr. Burkes incentive award is based on the successful achievement of a financial performance target for EFH Corp. and the financial and operational performance targets for TXU Energy and an individual performance modifier that increased his incentive award. In 2009, Mr. Burke strengthened the TXU Energy management team and performance-oriented culture to drive strong financial and operational results at TXU Energy. Among the operational results, Mr. Burke led the successful implementation of a new customer care system and successfully managed the transition of a number of functions previously performed by Capgemini Energy. Among the financial results, Mr. Burke was successful in driving improvement in retail margins, managing TXU Energy through a challenging economic environment and implementing overall customer satisfaction ratings. Given these significant accomplishments and other achievements (including his continued commitment to build a strong retail and customer-focused culture at TXU Energy), the O&C Committee approved an individual performance modifier that increased Mr. Burkes incentive award. B-11 Table of Contents In October 2009, the O&C Committee approved an increase in the annual target award under the EAIP from 75% of base salary to 85% of base salary for Messrs. Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke. These increases will be effective for the 2010 award period. Long-Term Incentive Awards Long-Term Cash Incentive In October 2009, the O&C Committee approved the adoption of a new long-term cash incentive (the LTI), effective as of the date of adoption, to be included by amendment in the employment agreements of each of Messrs. Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke. Under the terms of the LTI, each of Messrs. Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke will be entitled to receive on September 30, 2012, to the extent such Named Executive Officer remains employed by EFH Corp. on such date (with customary exceptions for death, disability, and leaving for good reason or termination without cause), an additional one-time, lump-sum cash payment equal to 75% of the aggregate EAIP award received by such executive officer for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. In February 2010, the O&C Committee approved the adoption of an LTI to be included by amendment in the employment agreement of Mr. Young. Under the terms of the LTI, Mr. Young will be entitled to receive on September 30, 2012, to the extent Mr. Young remains employed by EFH Corp. on such date (with customary exceptions for death, disability, and leaving for good reason or termination without cause), an additional one-time, lump-sum cash payment equal to 100% of the aggregate EAIP award received by Mr. Young for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. These awards provide significant retentive value because an award is not paid to an executive officer unless the executive officer remains employed with us until September 30, 2012 (subject to the customary exceptions described above). In addition, these awards provide additional incentive to our executive officers to achieve top operational and financial performance because the award is based on a percentage of the executive officers annual performance-based cash bonuses. Long-Term Equity Incentives We believe it is important to strongly align the interests of our executive officers and shareholders through equity-based compensation. In December 2007, our Board approved and adopted our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan pursuant to which we grant Stock Option Awards to our executive officers. The purpose of the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan is to:  promote our long-term financial interests and growth by attracting and retaining management and other personnel with the training, experience and ability to make a substantial contribution to our success;  motivate management and other personnel by means of growth-related incentives to achieve long-range goals, and  strengthen the correlation between the long-term interests of our shareholders and the interests of our executive officers through opportunities for stock (or stock-based) ownership in EFH Corp. The Stock Option Awards granted to our executive officers provide significant retentive value because a portion of these awards is time-based and vest over a five year period. In addition, we believe that the Stock Option Awards granted to our executive officers provide incentive to our executive officers to achieve top operational and financial performance because a portion of these Stock Option Awards is performance-based and only vests upon EFH Corp. achieving certain management EBITDA targets. B-12 Table of Contents In February 2008, Mr. Young was granted 7,500,000 Stock Option Awards. In May 2008, Messrs. Campbell, Walters and Burke were granted 4,000,000, 2,000,000 and 2,450,000 Stock Option Awards, respectively. In December 2008, Mr. Keglevic was granted 2,500,000 Stock Option Awards. Each of these Stock Option Awards are set forth in the table below and are referred to as the Original Stock Option Awards, half of which were Original Time Vested Options and half of which were Original Performance Vested Options. The exercise price of the Original Stock Option Awards (the fair market value on the grant date) is $5.00. Executive Officer Original Time Vested Options Original Performance Vested Options Exercise Price John Young 3,750,000 3,750,000 $ 5.00 Paul Keglevic 1,250,000 1,250,000 $ 5.00 David Campbell 2,000,000 2,000,000 $ 5.00 Robert Walters 1,000,000 1,000,000 $ 5.00 James Burke 1,225,000 1,225,000 $ 5.00 In October 2009 (February 2010, with respect to Mr. Young), the O&C Committee approved the grant of new Stock Option Awards to the Named Executive Officers as set forth in the table below. The new Stock Option Awards are referred to as the New Stock Option Awards, a portion of which are New Time Vested Options and a portion of which are New Cliff Vested Options. In connection with these grants, each Named Executive Officer surrendered to EFH Corp. a portion of his Original Performance Vested Options. The exercise price of the New Stock Option Awards is $3.50. Executive Officer Surrendered Original Performance Vested Options New Time Vested Options New Cliff Vested Options Exercise Price John Young 1,500,000 1,500,000 1,500,000 $ $ 5.00 3.50 Paul Keglevic 500,000 500,000 500,000 $ $ 5.00 3.50 David Campbell 800,000 800,000 800,000 $ $ 5.00 3.50 Robert Walters 400,000 400,000 400,000 $ $ 5.00 3.50 James Burke 490,000 200,000 490,000 $ $ 5.00 3.50 Please refer to the outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End2009 table, including the footnotes thereto, for a summary of the outstanding Stock Option Awards held by each of the Named Executive Officers. The Stock Option Awards vest (subject to the executive officer continuing to be employed by EFH Corp.) as follows:  Time Vested Options  The Original Time Vested Options and the New Time Vested Options vest in 20% increments on each of the first five anniversaries of September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2009, respectively.  The New Cliff Vested Options vest 100% on September 30, 2014.  Performance Vested Options  The Original Performance Vested Options vest in 20% increments on each of the first five anniversaries of December 31, 2007, subject to our achievement of the annual management EBITDA target for the given fiscal year (or certain cumulative performance targets) as detailed in the stock option agreements. In deciding whether to vest the Original Performance Vested Options, the O&C Committee considers EFH Corp.s quantitative performance against certain management EBITDA targets. The method of calculating management EBITDA for purposes of vesting the Original Performance Vested Options is the same as the method for calculating management EBITDA for purposes of the EAIP, as described above. The O&C Committee also has broad discretion to consider other qualitative and quantitative criteria that it deems appropriate in connection with its decision to vest the Original Performance Vested Options. B-13 Table of Contents Our management EBITDA for 2009 was less than the management EBITDA target of $5.569 billion set forth in the applicable stock option agreements with respect to 2009. While EFH Corp. did not meet the applicable management EBITDA target, which was originally established in 2007, it exceeded the management EBITDA target established by the O&C Committee in the beginning of 2009 for purposes of the EAIP. In addition, EFH Corp.s actual SG&A for 2009 was less than the targeted amount of SG&A set by the O&C Committee. Given these achievements, as well as the successful attainment of most of the other annual financial and operational performance targets that were established by the O&C Committee at the beginning of 2009, the O&C Committee exercised its discretionary authority under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan and approved the vesting of the 2009 Original Performance Vested Options. In the future, we may make additional discretionary grants of stock options or other equity-based compensation to reward high performance or achievement. Equity Investment In addition to being granted Stock Option Awards, several of our Named Executive Officers (including Messrs. Young, Keglevic, Campbell and Burke) have an equity investment in EFH Corp. These investments have been made through a direct cash investment for shares of EFH Corp. common stock (Mr. Young) and/or through the receipt of restricted stock units (Mr. Young) or deferred shares of EFH Corp. common stock (Messrs. Keglevic, Campbell and Burke) (i) as a result of the executive officer foregoing the right to receive certain payments from EFH Corp., whether in respect of outstanding equity awards issued prior to the Merger or otherwise (Messrs. Campbell and Burke) or (ii) as consideration for compensation forfeited by the executive officer when he left his former employer to join EFH Corp. (Messrs. Young and Keglevic). We believe such investment strongly aligns the interests of our Named Executive Officers with the interests of our shareholders and provides increased incentive to our executive officers to maximize financial and operational performance because the value of their investment is dependant upon the success of EFH Corp. In addition, as we are a private company, the illiquid nature of the investment provides additional retentive value. Other Elements of Compensation General Our executive officers generally have the opportunity to participate in certain of our broad-based employee compensation plans, including our Thrift (401(k)) Plan, retirement plans and non-qualified benefit plans. Please refer to the footnotes to the Summary Compensation table for a more detailed description of our Thrift Plan, the narrative that follows the Pension Benefits table for a more detailed description of our Retirement Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the footnotes to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table for a more detailed description of our Salary Deferral Program. B-14 Table of Contents Perquisites We do not believe that a significant amount of perquisites fit within our compensation philosophy. Those perquisites that exist are intended to serve as part of a competitive total compensation program and to enhance our executive officers ability to conduct company business. These benefits include financial planning, a preventive physical health exam and reimbursement for certain spousal travel expenses. Expenditures for the perquisites outlined above are disclosed by individual in footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table. The following is a summary of perquisites offered to our Named Executive Officers that are not available to all employees: Executive Financial Planning: We pay for our executive officers to receive financial planning services. This service is intended to support them in managing their financial affairs, which we consider especially important given the high level of time commitment and performance expectation required of our executive officers. Furthermore, we believe that such service helps ensure greater accuracy and compliance with individual tax regulations by our executive officers. Annual Executive Physical Health Exam: We pay for our executive officers to receive annual physical health exams. The health of our executive officers is important given the vital leadership role they play in directing and operating the company. Our executive officers are important assets of EFH Corp., and this benefit is designed to help ensure their health and long-term ability to serve our shareholders. Spouse Travel Expenses: From time to time, we pay for an executive officers spouse to travel with the executive officer when taking a business trip. Contingent Payments We have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Young, Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke. Each of the employment agreements provides that certain payments and benefits will be paid upon the expiration or termination of the agreement under various circumstances, including termination without cause, resignation for good reason and termination of employment within a fixed period of time following a change in control. We believe these provisions are important in order to attract and retain the caliber of executive officers that our business requires and provide incentive for our executive officers to fully consider potential changes that are in our and our shareholders best interest, even if such changes would result in the executive officers termination of employment. For a description of the applicable provisions in the employment agreements of our Named Executive Officers see Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. Other On February 15, 2010, the O&C Committee approved several changes to Mr. Youngs compensation arrangements, including certain amendments to his employment agreement and his stock option agreement. Generally, these changes were made after considering relevant market compensation data and for retention purposes. Pursuant to Mr. Youngs amended employment agreement, Mr. Youngs base salary was increased from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000, which increase will be effective retroactively to January 1, 2010, and Mr. Young was granted a new cash-based retention incentive award (the Retention Award). Under the terms of the Retention Award, Mr. Young will be entitled to receive on September 30, 2012, to the extent Mr. Young remains employed by EFH Corp. on such date (with customary exceptions for death, disability and leaving for good reason or termination without cause), an additional one-time, lump-sum cash payment equal to 100% of the aggregate Executive Annual Incentive Plan award received by (or otherwise payable to) Mr. Young for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. In addition, Mr. Youngs amended employment agreement provides that EFH Corp. will (i) purchase, on behalf of Mr. Young, a 10 year term life insurance policy in an insured amount equal to $10,000,000 and (ii) adopt a supplemental retirement plan for Mr. Young that vests on December 31, 2014 (with customary exceptions for death, disability and leaving for good reason or termination without cause) with a value of $3,000,000. B-15 Table of Contents Pursuant to Mr. Youngs amended stock option agreement, Mr. Young received a grant of 3,000,000 new stock options under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan at a strike price of $3.50 per share. Half of Mr. Youngs new stock options are cliff-vested options that will vest 100% on September 30, 2014, and the other half are time-vested options that will vest 20% per year over a five-year period beginning September 30, 2009. In connection with the grant of these new stock options, Mr. Young surrendered to EFH Corp. 1,500,000 unvested performance-related stock options that were granted to Mr. Young when he joined EFH Corp. Also, in February 2010, the O&C Committee increased Mr. Burkes base salary to $630,000. The increase took effect retroactively on January 1, 2010. Accounting and Tax Considerations Accounting Considerations Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the total amount of compensation expense to be recorded for stock-based awards (e.g., Stock Option Awards granted under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan) is based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. This fair value is then recorded as expense over the vesting period, with an offsetting increase in paid-in capital. The amount of compensation expense is not subsequently adjusted for changes in our share price, for the actual number of shares distributed, or for any other factors except for true-ups related to estimated forfeitures compared to actual forfeitures. The surrendered shares are considered modifications to the original awards and are treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award. The compensation expense related to the new award represents the incremental costs of the surrendered shares and is based on the new grant date fair value and is recognized over its new vesting period. Income Tax Considerations Section 162(m) of the Code limits the tax deductibility by a publicly held company of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the CEO or any other of its three most highly compensated executive officers other than the principal financial officer. Because EFH Corp. is a privately-held company, Section 162(m) will not limit the tax deductibility of any executive compensation for 2009. The O&C Committee administers our compensation programs with the good faith intention of complying with Section 409A of the Code.

The Retirement Plan contains both a traditional defined benefit component and a cash balance component. Only employees hired before January 1, 2002 may participate in the traditional defined benefit component. Accordingly, none of the Named Executive Officers participates in the traditional defined benefit component. Employees hired after January 1, 2002 and before October 1, 2007 are eligible to participate in the cash balance component. In addition, effective December 31, 2009, certain assets and liabilities under the Salary Deferral Program and the Supplemental Retirement Plan were transferred to the cash balance component of the Retirement Plan. Accordingly, Messrs. Campbell and Burke have participated and may continue to participate in the cash balance component of the Retirement Plan; and Messrs. Young, Keglevic and Walters participate in the cash balance component of the Retirement Plan solely with respect to amounts that were transferred from the Salary Deferral Program. Under the cash balance component of the Retirement Plan, hypothetical accounts are established for participants and credited with monthly contribution credits equal to a percentage of the participants compensation (3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5% or 6.5% depending on the participants combined age and years of accredited service), contribution credits equal to the amounts transferred from the Salary Deferral Program and/or the Supplemental Retirement Plan effective as of December 31, 2009 and interest credits on all of such amounts based on the average yield of the 30-year Treasury bond for the 12 months ending November 30 of the prior year. The Supplemental Retirement Plan provides for the payment of retirement benefits, which would otherwise be limited by the Code or the definition of earnings under the Retirement Plan. Under the Supplemental Retirement Plan, retirement benefits under the cash balance component are calculated in accordance with the same formula used under the Retirement Plan. Participation in EFH Corp.s Supplemental Retirement Plan has been limited to employees of all of its businesses other than Oncor, who were employed by EFH Corp. (or its participating subsidiaries) on or before October 1, 2007. Accordingly, Messrs. Campbell and Burke participate in the Supplemental Retirement Plan, and Messrs. Young, Keglevic and Walters are not eligible to participate in the Supplemental Retirement Plan. B-21 Table of Contents Benefits accrued under the Supplemental Retirement Plan after December 31, 2004, are subject to Section 409A of the Code. Accordingly, certain provisions of the Supplemental Retirement Plan have been modified in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A and related guidance. The present value of the accumulated benefit for the Retirement Plan (the cash balance component) was calculated as the value of their cash balance account projected to age 65 at an assumed growth rate of 4.75% and then discounted back to December 31, 2009 at 5.90%. No mortality or turnover assumptions were applied. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation2009 (1) The following table sets forth information regarding plans that provide for the deferral of the Named Executive Officers compensation on a basis that is not tax-qualified for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009: Name Executive Contributions in Last FY ($) Registrant Contributions in Last FY ($) (2) Aggregate Earnings in Last FY ($) Aggregate Withdrawals/ Distributions($) (3) Aggregate Balance at Last FYE ($) (4) John F.

Burke   86,658  233,262 Rizwan Chand   28,960 (116,068 )  (1) The amounts reported in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table include deferrals and the company match under the Salary Deferral Program. The amounts reported as Executive Contributions in Last FY are salary deferrals and are also included as Salary in the Summary Compensation Table. Under EFH Corp.s Salary Deferral Program each employee of EFH Corp. and its participating subsidiaries who is in a designated job level and whose annual salary is equal to or greater than an amount established under the Salary Deferral Program ($110,840 for the program year beginning January 1, 2009) may elect to defer up to 50% of annual base salary, and/or up to 100% of any bonus or incentive award, for a maturity period of seven years, for a maturity period ending with the retirement of such employee, or for a combination thereof. EFH Corp. makes a matching award, which vests at the end of the applicable maturity period (subject to acceleration or forfeiture under certain circumstances), equal to 100% of up to the first 8% of salary deferred under the Salary Deferral Program. Deferrals are credited with earnings or losses based on the performance of investment alternatives under the Salary Deferral Program selected by each participant. At the end of the applicable maturity period, the trustee for the Salary Deferral Program distributes the deferred compensation, any vested matching awards and the applicable earnings in cash as a lump sum or in annual installments at the participants election made at the time of deferral. EFH Corp. is financing the retirement option portion of the Salary Deferral Program through the purchase of corporate-owned life insurance on the lives of participants. The proceeds from such insurance are expected to allow EFH Corp. to fully recover the cost of the retirement option. Beginning in 2010, certain executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, will not be eligible to participate in the Salary Deferral Program. (2) The amount included in Registrant Contributions in Last FY is attributable to EFH Corp.s matching award under the Salary Deferral Program. (3) The Aggregate Withdrawals/Distributions($) column excludes amounts transferred from the Supplemental Retirement Plan and/or Salary Deferral Program to the cash balance component of the Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2009 for Messrs. Young ($37,500), Keglevic ($48,511), Walters ($71,283) and Burke ($25,000). In accordance with the terms of the Salary Deferral Plan, Mr. Chand forfeited $39,606 of company matching and received a distribution of the remaining balance of his account upon termination of his employment. (4) A portion of the amounts reported as Aggregate Balance at Last FYE are also included in the Summary Compensation Table as follows: for Mr. Young, $80,000 and $66,667 of executive contributions are included as Salary for 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $80,000 and $66,667 of company matching contributions are included as All Other Compensation for 2009 and 2008, respectively; for Mr. Keglevic, $48,000 and $20,000 of executive contributions are included as Salary for 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $48,000 and $20,000 of company matching contributions are included as All Other Compensation for 2009 and 2008, respectively; for Mr. Walters, $46,000 and $30,667 of executive contributions are included as Salary for 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $46,000 and $30,667 of company matching contributions are included as All Other Compensation for 2009 and 2008, respectively; for Mr. Burke, $48,000 and $27,417 of executive contributions are included as Salary for 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $48,000 and $27,417 of company matching contributions are included as All Other Compensation for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The amounts reported as Aggregate Balance at Last FYE reflect decreases resulting from the amounts transferred from the Supplemental Retirement Plan and/or Salary Deferral Program to the cash balance component of the Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2009 for Messrs. Young ($37,500), Keglevic ($48,511), Walters ($71,283) and Burke ($25,000). B-22 Table of Contents Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control The tables and narrative below provide information for payments to each of the Named Executive Officers (or, as applicable, enhancements to payments or benefits) in the event of his termination, including if such termination is voluntary, for cause, as a result of death, as a result of disability, without cause or for good reason or without cause or for good reason in connection with a change in control. The information in the tables below is presented in accordance with SEC rules, assuming termination of employment as of December 31, 2009. Employment Arrangements with Contingent Payments As of December 31, 2009, each of Messrs. Young, Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke had employment agreements with change in control and severance provisions as described in the following tables. In addition, in October 2009, the O&C Committee approved several changes to the compensation arrangements for all of the Named Executive Officers other than Messrs. Young and Chand, which changes were effective as of December 31, 2009 but not yet documented in such Named Executive Officers employment agreements. Certain of these changes affected the potential payments of Messrs. Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke and are reflected in the following tables. In February, 2010, Mr. Youngs employment agreement was amended and restated effective retroactively on January 1, 2010. Because the changes to Mr. Youngs employment agreement were not effective as of December 31, 2009, they are not reflected in the following table for Mr. Young, but are described elsewhere in this Annex B. Mr. Chand had an employment agreement, and the change in control and severance terms included in the employment agreement governed until his employment with EFH Corp. terminated in October 2009. With respect to each Named Executive Officers employment agreement, a change in control is generally defined as (i) a transaction that results in a sale of substantially all of our assets to another person and such person having more seats on our Board than the Sponsor Group, (ii) a transaction that results in a person not in the Sponsor Group owning more than 50% of our common stock and such person having more seats on our Board than the Sponsor Group or (iii) a transaction that results in the Sponsor Group owning less than 20% of our common stock and the Sponsor Group not being able to appoint a majority of the directors to our Board. Each Named Executive Officers employment agreement includes customary non-compete and non-solicitation provisions that generally restrict the Named Executive Officers ability to compete with us or solicit our customers or employees for his own personal benefit during the term of the employment agreement and 24 months (with respect to Mr. Young) or 18 months (with respect to Messrs. Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke) after the employment agreement expires or is terminated. In addition, in October 2009, the O&C Committee approved the adoption of a new LTI to be included by amendment in the employment agreement of Messrs. Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke. Under the terms of the LTI, in the event of the death or disability of any such Named Executive Officer, his termination without cause or resignation for good reason (or in the event we elect not to extend his employment term), or his termination without cause or resignation for good reason (or in the event we elect not to extend his employment term) within 24 months following a change in control of EFH Corp., in each case prior to September 30, 2012, such Named Executive Officer shall be entitled to receive the LTI, or a pro rata portion thereof, calculated as (i) 75% of the aggregate EAIP award actually earned by the Named Executive Officer for any applicable fiscal year completed prior to the date of the Named Executive Officers termination, plus (ii) for a termination occurring in fiscal year 2009, 2010, or 2011, 75% of the Named Executive Officers prorated annual performance-based cash bonus for the year of termination. In February 2010, Mr. Youngs employment agreement was amended to add a similar new LTI that is calculated based on 100% of the aggregate EAIP award actually earned by Mr. Young for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. B-23 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, each of Messrs. Young, Keglevic, Campbell, Walters and Burke had stock option agreements. Under the stock option agreement for each Named Executive Officer, in the event of such Named Executive Officers termination without cause or resignation for good reason (or in the event we elect not to extend his employment term) following a change in control of EFH Corp., such Named Executive Officers Original Time Vested Options would become immediately exercisable as to 100% of the shares of EFH Corp. common stock subject to such options immediately prior to the change in control. As of December 31, 2009, the fair market value of the shares of EFH Corp. common stock underlying each Named Executive Officers Original Time Vested Options was less than the exercise price of such options. 1.

All of EFIH Finances equity interests are owned by EFIH. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Policies and Procedures Relating to Related Party Transactions The Board has adopted a policy governing EFH Corp. and its subsidiaries, including EFIH and EFIH Finance, regarding related person transactions. Under this policy, a related person transaction shall be consummated or shall continue only if: 1. the Audit Committee of the Board approves or ratifies such transaction in accordance with the policy and if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arms length dealings with an unrelated third party; 2. the transaction is approved by the disinterested members of the Board or the Executive Committee of the Board; or 3. the transaction involves compensation approved by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board. For purposes of this policy, the term related person includes EFH Corp.s directors, executive officers, 5% shareholders and their immediate family members. Immediate family members means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of a director, executive officer or 5% shareholder. A related person transaction is a transaction between EFH Corp. or its subsidiaries, including EFIH and EFIH Finance, and a related person, other than the types of transactions described below, which are deemed to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee of the Board: 1. any compensation paid to a director if the compensation is required to be reported under Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; 2. any transaction with another company at which a related persons only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer), director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of that companys ownership interests; 3. any charitable contribution, grant or endowment by EFH Corp. to a charitable organization, foundation or university at which a related persons only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer) or director; 4. transactions where the related persons interest arises solely from the ownership of EFH Corp.s equity securities and all holders of that class of equity securities received the same benefit on a pro rata basis; 5. transactions involving a related party where the rates or charges involved are determined by competitive bids; 6. any transaction with a related party involving the rendering of services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, as rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority; 7. any transaction with a related party involving services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture, or similar service; B-32 Table of Contents 8. transactions available to all employees or customers generally (unless required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, if applicable); 9. transactions involving less than $100,000 when aggregated with all similar transactions; 10. transactions between EFH Corp. and its subsidiaries or between subsidiaries of EFH Corp.; 11. transactions not required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and 12. open market purchases of the EFH Corp. or its subsidiaries debt or equity securities and interest payments on such debt. The Board has determined that it is appropriate for the Audit Committee of the Board to review and approve or ratify related person transactions. Accordingly, at least annually, management reviews related person transactions to be entered into by EFH Corp. or its subsidiaries, if any. After review, the Audit Committee of the Board approves/ratifies or disapproves such transactions. Management updates the Audit Committee of the Board as to any material changes to such related person transactions. In unusual circumstances, EFH Corp. or its subsidiaries may enter into related person transactions in advance of receiving approval, provided that such related person transactions are reviewed and ratified as soon as reasonably practicable by the Audit Committee of the Board. If the Audit Committee of the Board determines not to ratify such transactions, EFH Corp. shall make all reasonable efforts to cancel or otherwise terminate such transactions. Transactions described below under Related Person TransactionsTransactions with Sponsor Affiliates are not related person transactions under the EFH Corp. policy because they are not with a director, executive officer, 5% shareholder or any of their immediate family members, but are described in the interest of greater disclosure. Related Person Transactions Transactions with Sponsor Affiliates Affiliates of the Sponsor Group participated in the debt exchange offers completed in November 2009 by EFH Corp., EFIH and EFIH Finance to exchange new senior secured notes for certain EFH Corp. and TCEH notes. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and KKR Capital Markets LLC were paid fees in the amounts of $750,000 and $260,000, respectively, as compensation for their services as dealer managers in the debt exchange offers and TPG Capital, L.P. received a fee in the amount of $260,000 as compensation for the advisory services it rendered in connection with the debt exchange offers. From time to time affiliates of the Sponsor Group may acquire debt or debt securities issued by EFIH and/or EFIH Finance in open market transactions or through loan syndications. Director Independence Because of their relationships with the Sponsor Group or with EFH Corp. directly, none of the managers on the EFIH Board or the directors on the EFIH Finance Board would be considered independent. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION Neither EFIH nor EFIH Finance has a compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent function. As described above, all compensation matters for EFIH and EFIH Finance, including compensation philosophy, are administered by EFH Corp. For a description of the compensation committee interlocks and insider participation of the O&C Committee of EFH Corp., please see the disclosure set forth under Executive CompensationCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation above.

(a) Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes: (1) to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; (3) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering; (4) that, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness; provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use; and (5) that, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrants under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrants undertake that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrants pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrants will be sellers to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrants relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; II-10 Table of Contents (ii) any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants or used or referred to by the undersigned registrants; (iii) the portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrants or their securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants; and (iv) any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrants to the purchaser. (b) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
