UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, THE TERM "FISCAL YEAR" REFERS TO OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING MAY 31. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, THE TERM "COMMON STOCK" REFERS TO SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. CORPORATE BACKGROUND We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 27, 2006. Our offices are currently located at 5348 Vegas Dr., Suite 112, Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. Our telephone number is (702) 441-0703. We have a website at http://www.easycdyearbook.com. The information contained on our website does not form a part of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. We are a development stage company with no revenue and limited operations to date. We are focused on developing and offering a video program called "How to publish a Multimedia Yearbook" that teaches users how to publish a multimedia yearbook for a school or club, using existing computer equipment and open source software. A multimedia yearbook is a CD/DVD that contains video, photos, audio and text that is PC and Mac compatible. Our video will provide instruction on various areas of multimedia including, among others, downloading & installing free image manipulation software, collecting and editing digital photos, installing a free video editing tool, recording audio and creating interactive menus. Our vision is to offer schools and clubs an electronic yearbook as an alternative to their traditional printed yearbook. Our target market is K-12 schools in North America. We currently have no revenues and, while our website is complete, we have not yet completed development of our video product. We expect to have the commercial product available for sale by the end of 2008, and begin generating revenues during our 2009 fiscal year. When we complete the development and production of our product, we plan to focus our marketing efforts in North America. We also plan to develop revenues from the sale of our product exclusively by sale over the Internet. Our product will be priced for mass market consumption so that schools with an interest in producing their own multimedia yearbook can purchase our product. If we are successful and have the financial and cash resources to do so, we then plan to expand our video program with complementary videos for other areas of multimedia. We also plan to expand our business from sales generation exclusively from the Internet to having our products sold to customers through other consumer channels such as retailers, wholesalers, or other direct sale methods. Since our inception, we have not made any significant purchases or sale of assets, nor have we been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. 1 SUMMARY OF THE OFFERING Shares of common stock being offered by the selling stockholders: 1,886,400 shares of our common stock.

Market for the common stock: There is no public market for our common stock. After the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we intend to have a market maker file an application on our behalf to have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.

The information contained in this table should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" and the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this prospectus. Our auditors have issued an audit opinion which includes a statement describing their doubts about whether we will continue as a going concern. In addition, our financial status creates substantial doubt whether we will continue as a going concern. STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS Period from Inception (June 27, 2006) to May 31, 2008 ------------ Net loss $ 4,695 Net loss per common share: -- Basic and diluted (less than $0.01 per share) 0 Weighted average number of Common shares outstanding: 5,815,261 BALANCE SHEET DATA May 31, 2008 ------------ Total assets $ 47,946 Total liabilities -- Total Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity $ 47,946 3 RISK FACTORS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS AND OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR COMPANY. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. AS A RESULT, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AS A COMPANY IN THE EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT WITH AN UNPROVEN BUSINESS STRATEGY, OUR LIMITED HISTORY OF OPERATIONS MAKES EVALUATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS DIFFICULT. We were incorporated on June 27, 2006. We currently have no products, customers, or revenues. Our business prospects are difficult to predict because of our limited operating history, early stage of development and unproven business strategy. Our primary business activities are focused on the development and marketing of an instructional video program on creating a multimedia yearbook. Although we believe that our video product has significant profit potential, we may not attain profitable operations and our management may not succeed in realizing our business objectives. OUR BUSINESS PLAN MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL, AND IF IT FAILS, WE WILL NOT HAVE ALTERNATE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS TO OFFER TO ENSURE OUR CONTINUATION AS A GOING CONCERN. The success of our business plan is dependent on the development of our sole product, our instructional video program on creating a multimedia yearbook. Our ability to develop this video program is unproven, and the lack of operating history makes it difficult to validate our business plan. In addition, the success of our business plan is dependent upon the market acceptance of our system. Should this system be too narrowly focused or should the target market not be as responsive as we anticipate, we will not have in place alternate services or products that we can offer to ensure our continuation as a going concern. WE HAVE MAINTAINED LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. Our management believes that the prior investment of approximately $52,600 by our current stockholders will be sufficient to commence and continue our planned activities for approximately 12 months after this offering. We expect, however, to continue to incur operating losses in future periods. These losses will occur because we do not yet have any revenues to offset the expenses associated with the development, marketing and sales of our video program. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be successful in generating revenues in the future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate revenues, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. We have incurred net losses of $4,695 for the period from June 27, 2006 (date of inception) through May 31, 2008. We anticipate generating losses for the next 12 months, with revenues beginning no earlier than the fiscal year of 2009. Therefore, we may be unable to continue operations in the future as a going concern. No adjustment has been made in the accompanying financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities which could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent 4 auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the accompanying financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have completed only initial stages of our business plan and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to generate enough revenue from our business in order to achieve profitability. It is not possible at this time for us to predict with assurance the potential success of our business. The revenue and income potential of our proposed business and operations are unproven, and the lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate the future prospects of our business. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in our Company. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN OR STAY IN BUSINESS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. Our ability to successfully develop our technology and to eventually produce and sell our services to generate operating revenues depends on our ability to obtain the necessary financing to implement our business plan. We raised approximately $52,600 from private placements of our common stock, which we required to commence operations and which will help us remain operational during the next 12 months. However, we will require additional financing, through issuance of debt and/or equity, in order to establish profitable operations. Such financing, if required, may not be forthcoming. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business. BECAUSE OUR CURRENT OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE NOT RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO RECOVER AGAINST THEM. Both of our officers and directors are located outside of the United States: one resides in Tanzania and one in Canada. Were one or more shareholders to bring an action against management in the United States and succeed, either through default or on the merits, and obtain a financial award against an officer or director of the Company, that shareholder may be required to enforce and collect on his, her or its judgment in these countries, unless the officer or director owned assets which were located in the United States. Further, shareholder efforts to bring an action in these countries against its citizens for any alleged breach of a duty in a foreign jurisdiction may be difficult, as prosecution of a claim in a foreign jurisdiction, and in particular a foreign nation, is fraught with difficulty and may be effectively, if not financially, unfeasible. WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK OF OUR INABILITY TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS. Our management has limited experience in marketing our proposed product and no distribution system has yet been developed and tested. While we have plans for marketing and sales, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified individuals with marketing and sales expertise. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our services will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services. IF OUR ESTIMATES RELATED TO EXPENDITURES ARE ERRONEOUS OR INACCURATE, OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL AND YOU COULD LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Our success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our management's estimates of expenditures for legal and accounting services, website development, development and production of our video, and administrative expenses, which 5 management estimates to total approximately $40,000 over the next twelve months. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Expenditures" below for additional detail. If such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate, or we encounter unforeseen costs, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, which could result in the failure of our business and you could lose your entire investment. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST OUR COMPETITORS. We are engaged in a rapidly evolving technology industry, and face competition from other companies which offer designated software to publish a multimedia yearbook. Our competitors may have greater resources, research and development staff, sales and marketing staff, and facilities than we do. In addition, other recently developed technologies are, or may in the future be, the basis of competitive products. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop technologies and products that are more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology and product obsolete or noncompetitive. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL COLLECTIVELY ALLOCATE ONLY A PORTION OF THEIR TIME TO OUR COMPANY'S BUSINESS WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EASY CD YEARBOOK'S SUCCESS. Currently, our officers and directors allocate only a portion of their time, or up to approximately 20 hours per week, to the operation of Easy CD Yearbook's business. If our business develops faster than anticipated, or if their other commitments require them to devote more substantial amounts of time, our ability to create and sustain a successful business could be negatively impacted. WE NEED TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT OUR PRODUCTS AND ONGOING OPERATIONS. The development and marketing of our products and services will continue to place a significant strain on our management and other resources. Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan. The loss of the services of Almaymoon Mawji, our President, Treasurer and a Director, would negatively impact our ability to sell our products, which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth. Currently, we have no employment agreement with Mr. Mawji and do not anticipate entering into any such agreement in the foreseeable future. RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK THERE IS CURRENTLY NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY PUBLIC MARKET WILL DEVELOP OR THAT OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE QUOTED FOR TRADING. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our securities and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the securities offered herein will develop after this offering, or, if developed, be sustained. After the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we intend to identify a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") to have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We do not currently have a market maker who is willing to participate in this application process, and even if we identify a market maker, there can be no assurance as to whether such application will be accepted. Our common stock may never be quoted on the 6 Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or, even if quoted, a public market may not materialize. If our securities are not eligible for initial quotation, or if quoted, are not eligible for continued quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or a public trading market does not develop, purchasers of the common stock may have difficulty selling or be unable to sell their securities should they desire to do so, rendering their shares effectively worthless and resulting in a complete loss of their investment. BECAUSE WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO "PENNY STOCK" RULES ONCE OUR SHARES ARE QUOTED ON THE OVER-THE-COUNTER BULLETIN BOARD, THE LEVEL OF TRADING ACTIVITY IN OUR STOCK MAY BE REDUCED. Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks" are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges or quoted on Nasdaq). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer's presumed control over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors" must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules. If a trading market does develop for our common stock, these regulations will likely be applicable, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares. FINRA SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a stockholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock. STATE SECURITIES LAWS MAY LIMIT SECONDARY TRADING, WHICH MAY RESTRICT THE STATES IN WHICH YOU CAN SELL THE SHARES OFFERED BY THIS PROSPECTUS. If you purchase shares of our common stock sold by the selling stockholders in this offering, you may not be able to resell the shares in any state unless and until the shares of our common stock are qualified for secondary trading under the applicable securities laws of such state or there is confirmation that an exemption, such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals, is available for secondary trading in such state. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in registering or qualifying our common stock for secondary trading, or identifying an available exemption for secondary trading in our 7 common stock in every state. If we fail to register or qualify, or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of, our common stock in any particular state, the shares of common stock could not be offered or sold to, or purchased by, a resident of that state. In the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock, the market for the common stock will be limited which could drive down the market price of our common stock and reduce the liquidity of the shares of our common stock and a stockholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock at all or at current market prices, which could increase a stockholder's risk of losing some or all of his investment. THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE THAT YOU MAY PAY FOR THE SHARES. Even if our shares are quoted for trading on the OTCBB following this offering and a public market develops for our common stock, the market price of our common stock may be volatile. It may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors: * variations in quarterly operating results; * our announcements of significant contracts and achievement of milestones; * our relationships with other companies or capital commitments; * additions or departures of key personnel; * sales of common stock or termination of stock transfer restrictions; * changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, if any; and * fluctuations in stock market price and volume. Your inability to sell your shares during a decline in the price of our stock may increase losses that you may suffer as a result of your investment. Our insiders beneficially own a significant portion of our stock, and accordingly, may have control over stockholder matters, the company's business and management. As of June 23, 2008 our executive officers and directors beneficially own 5,500,000 shares of our common stock in the aggregate, or approximately 74.46% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Mr. Almaymoon Mawji, our President, Treasurer and a Director, owns 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 33.85%, and Zahirali Kaba, our Secretary and a Director, owns 3,000,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 40.61%. Our As a result, our executive officers, directors and affiliated persons will have significant influence to: * elect or defeat the election of our directors; * amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws; * effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and * affect the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote. Moreover, because of the significant ownership position held by our insiders, new investors will not be able to effect a change in the company's business or management, and therefore, shareholders would be subject to decisions made by management and the majority shareholders. In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors and executive officers, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Management's stock ownership may discourage a 8 potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES IN THIS OFFERING WAS DETERMINED BY US AND MAY NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL MARKET PRICE FOR THE SECURITIES. The initial offering price of the common stock offered by the selling stockholders pursuant to this prospectus the same price at which the selling stockholders purchased such securities from us in a private placement which closed on March 31, 2008. This price of $0.025 per share was determined by us arbitrarily. The price is not based on our financial condition and prospects, market prices of similar securities of comparable publicly traded companies, certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in similar activities to ours, or general conditions of the securities market. The price may not be indicative of the market price, if any, for the common stock in the trading market after this offering. The market price of the securities offered herein, if any, may decline below the initial public offering price. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against various companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. If instituted against us, regardless of the outcome, such litigation would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which would increase our operating expenses and affect our financial condition and business operations. BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK MUST RELY ON STOCK APPRECIATION FOR ANY RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT. There are no restrictions in our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution. We have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, holders of our common stock will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on their investment in our common stock. ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK MAY RESULT IN IMMEDIATE DILUTION TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. We are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 7,386,400 shares are issued and outstanding. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privilege of such shares, without consent of any of our stockholders. We may issue shares in connection with financing arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuances will result in immediate dilution to our existing shareholders' interests, which will negatively affect the value of your shares.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS We are not providing any tax advice as to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the securities offered herein. In making an investment decision, investors are strongly encouraged to consult their own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal, state and any applicable foreign tax consequences relating to their investment in our securities. USE OF PROCEEDS We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the selling stockholders pursuant to this prospectus. The selling stockholders named herein will receive all proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common stock in this offering. Please see "Selling Stockholders" below for a list of these individuals. We will pay all expenses (other than transfer taxes) of the selling stockholders in connection with this offering. DETERMINATION OF THE OFFERING PRICE There is no established public market for our shares of common stock. The offering price of $0.025 per share is the same price at which the selling stockholder purchased the shares from us in a private placement which closed on March 31, 2008. We believe that this price reflects the appropriate price that a potential investor would be willing to invest in our company at this initial stage of our development. This price bears no relationship whatsoever to our business plan, the price paid for our shares by our founders, our assets, earnings, book value or any other criteria of value. The offering price should not be regarded as an indicator of the future market price of the securities, which is likely to fluctuate. 10 The selling stockholders will offer the shares of common stock for resale at $0.025 per share until our shares are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. See "Plan of Distribution" for additional information. MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MARKET INFORMATION There is no established public market for our common stock. After the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we intend to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, to have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We do not currently have a market maker who is willing to list quotations for our common stock, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our shares will develop, or, if developed, that it will be sustained. We have issued 7,386,400 shares of our common stock since the Company's inception on June 27, 2006, all of which are restricted shares. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" below for information with respect to some of these shares. There are no outstanding options or warrants or securities that are convertible into shares of common stock. HOLDERS We had 39 holders of record of our common stock as of June 23, 2008. SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS We do not have any compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. DIVIDEND POLICY We have not paid any dividends since our incorporation and do not anticipate the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future. At present, our policy is to retain earnings, if any, to develop and market our product. The payment of dividends in the future will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, capital requirements, and operating financial conditions. DILUTION The shares of common stock to be sold by the selling stockholders are shares that are currently issued and outstanding. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing stockholders as a result of the offering by the selling stockholders pursuant to this prospectus. SELLING STOCKHOLDERS The selling stockholders named in this prospectus are offering all of the 1,886,400 shares of common stock offered through this prospectus.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION This prospectus relates to the registration of the resale of 1,886,400 shares of our common stock on behalf of the selling stockholders named herein. The selling stockholders may sell some or all of their shares at a fixed price of $0.025 per share until our shares are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. 13 Sales by selling stockholders must be made at the fixed price of $0.025 until a market develops for the stock. The shares may be sold or distributed from time to time by the selling stockholders or by pledgees, donees or transferees of, or successors in interest to, the selling stockholders, directly to one or more purchasers (including pledgees) or through brokers or dealers who act solely as agents. The distribution of the shares may be effected in one or more of the following methods: * Ordinary broker transactions, which may include long or short sales, * Transactions involving cross or block trades on any securities or market where our common stock is trading, * Purchases by brokers or dealers as principal and resale by such purchasers for their own accounts pursuant to this prospectus, * an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; * ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers; * privately negotiated transactions; * at the market to or through market makers or into an existing market for the shares; * through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether exchange listed or otherwise); * In other ways not involving market makers or established trading markets, including direct sales to purchasers or sales effected through agents; or * Any combination of the foregoing. The selling security holders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. In addition, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers who may engage in shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers that require the delivery by such broker-dealers of the shares, which shares may be resold thereafter pursuant to this prospectus. Brokers, dealers, or agents participating in the distribution of the shares may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent (which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer may be in excess of customary commissions). Neither the selling stockholders nor we can presently estimate the amount of such compensation. We know of no existing arrangements between the selling stockholders and any other stockholder, broker, dealer or agent relating to the sale or distribution of the shares. We do not anticipate that either our stockholders or we will engage an underwriter in the selling or distribution of our shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of the selling stockholders pursuant to this prospectus. We have agreed to bear the expenses of the registration of the shares, including legal and accounting fees, and such expenses are estimated to be approximately $17,350. The selling stockholders named in this prospectus must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in the offer and sale of the common stock being offered by them. The selling stockholders and any 14 broker-dealers who execute sales for the selling stockholders may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In particular, during such times as the selling stockholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable laws and may among other things: 1. Not engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our common stock; 2. Furnish each broker or dealer through which common stock may be offered, such copies of this prospectus from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer, and 3. Not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities permitted under the Exchange Act. Any commissions received by broker-dealers and any profit on the resale of shares sold by them while acting as principals might be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the Securities Act. STATE SECURITIES - BLUE SKY LAWS Transfer of our common stock may also be restricted under the securities regulations or laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as "Blue Sky" laws. Absent compliance with such individual state laws, our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions. Because the securities registered hereunder have not been registered for resale under the Blue Sky laws of any state, the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future, should be aware that there may be significant state Blue-Sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to sell the securities and of purchasers to purchase the securities. Accordingly, investors may not be able to liquidate their investments and should be prepared to hold the shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time. REGULATION M We have informed the selling stockholders that Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act may be applicable to them with respect to any purchase or sale of our common stock. In general, Rule 102 under Regulation M prohibits any person connected with a distribution of our common stock from directly or indirectly bidding for, or purchasing for any account in which it has a beneficial interest, any of the shares or any right to purchase the shares, for a period of one business day before and after completion of its participation in the distribution. During any distribution period, Regulation M prohibits the selling stockholders and any other persons engaged in the distribution from engaging in any stabilizing bid or purchasing our common stock except for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the open market price of the common stock. None of these persons may effect any stabilizing transaction to facilitate any offering at the market. As the selling stockholders will be offering and selling our common stock at the market, Regulation M will prohibit them from effecting any stabilizing transaction in contravention of Regulation M with respect to the shares. We also have advised the selling stockholders that they should be aware that the anti-manipulation provisions of Regulation M under the Exchange Act will apply to purchases and sales of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders, and that there are restrictions on market-making activities by persons engaged in the distribution of the shares. Under Regulation M, the selling stockholders or their agents may not bid for, purchase, or attempt to induce any person to bid for or purchase, shares of our common stock while such selling stockholders 15 are distributing shares covered by this prospectus. Regulation M may prohibit the selling stockholders from covering short sales by purchasing shares while the distribution is taking place, despite any contractual rights to do so under the Agreement. We have advised the selling stockholders that they should consult with their own legal counsel to ensure compliance with Regulation M. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES COMMON STOCK Our authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The holders of our common stock: * Have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available therefore, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors; * Are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; * Do not have pre-emptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights; and * Are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote. The shares of common stock are not subject to any future call or assessment and all have equal voting rights. There are no special rights or restrictions of any nature attached to any of the common shares and they all rank at equal rate or " pari passu,", each with the other, as to all benefits, which might accrue to the holders of the common shares. All registered stockholders are entitled to receive a notice of any general annual meeting to be convened by our Board of Directors. At any general meeting, subject to the restrictions on joint registered owners of common shares, on a showing of hands every stockholder who is present in person and entitled to vote has one vote, and on a poll every stockholder has one vote for each shares of common stock of which he is the registered owner and may exercise such vote either in person or by proxy. To the knowledge of our management, at the date hereof, our officers and directors are the only persons to exercise control, directly or indirectly, over more than 10% of our outstanding common shares. See "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management". We refer you to our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, copies of which were filed with the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and to the applicable statutes of the State of Nevada for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities. As of June 23, 2008, there were 7,386,400 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND RIGHTS There are no outstanding options, warrants, or rights to purchase any of our securities. 16 PREFERRED STOCK We are authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001. As of June 23, 2008 there were no preferred shares issued and outstanding. NON-CUMULATIVE VOTING Holders of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. CASH DIVIDENDS As of the date of this registration statement, we have not paid any cash dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of our Board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, into our business. TRANSFER AGENT The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Holladay Stock Transfer, Inc., 2939 North 67th Place, Suite C, Scottsdale, AZ 85251, tel. (480) 481-3940, fax (480) 481-3941. The transfer agent is responsible for all record-keeping and administrative functions in connection with our issued and outstanding common stock. SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Prior to this offering, there was no public market for our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities. Upon completion of this offering, based on our outstanding shares as of June 23, 2008, we will have outstanding an aggregate of 7,386,400 shares of our common stock. Of these shares, upon effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, the 1,886,400 shares covered hereby will be freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. The remaining 5,500,000 restricted shares of common stock to be outstanding after this offering are owned by our executive officers and directors, known as our "affiliates," and may not be resold in the public market except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or under an exemption under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or otherwise. RULE 144 In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who is not one of our affiliates and who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned 17 shares of our common stock that are deemed restricted securities for at least six months would be entitled after such six-month holding period to sell the common stock held by such person, subject to the continued availability of current public information about us (which current public information requirement is eliminated after a one-year holding period). A person who is one of our affiliates, or has been an affiliate of ours at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned shares of our common stock that are deemed restricted securities for at least six months would be entitled after such six-month holding period to sell his or her securities, provided that he or she sells an amount that does not exceed 1% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding, or 73,864 shares immediately after this offering (or, if our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, the average weekly trading volume of the shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale), subject to the continued availability of current public information about us, compliance with certain manner of sale provisions, and the filing of a Form 144 notice of sale if the sale is for an amount in excess of 5,000 shares or for an aggregate sale price of more than $50,000 in a three-month period. Rule 144 is not available for resales of restricted securities of shell companies or former shell companies until one year elapses from the time that such company is no longer considered a shell company. EXPERTS No expert or counsel named in this prospectus as having prepared or certified any part of this prospectus or having given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered or upon other legal matters in connection with the registration or offering of the common stock was employed on a contingency basis or had, or is to receive, in connection with the offering, a substantial interest, directly or indirectly, in the Company, nor was any such person connected with the Company as a promoter, managing or principal underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer or employee. Our financial statements for the period from June 27, 2006 (inception) to May 31, 2008, included in this prospectus have been audited by Moore and Associates, Chartered as set forth in their report included in this prospectus. LEGAL REPRESENTATION The validity of the issuance of the common stock offered hereby will be passed upon for us by Gersten Savage LLP, 600 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, included in the opinion letter filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement of which this prospectus is a part. OUR BUSINESS OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY We are a development stage company that was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on June 27, 2006. We are planning to produce and market a video program called "How to publish a Multimedia Yearbook". The program will be designed for teachers and students who wish to organize and publish a multimedia yearbook for their school or club. A multimedia yearbook is a CD/DVD that contains video, photos, audio and text that is PC and Mac compatible. Our product and services are currently in the development stage and are not ready for commercial sale. We anticipate our product will be available at the end of 2008. 18 Our goal is to offer a process to an inexpensive electronic multimedia yearbook that can replace or be a supplement to the traditional printed yearbook. We plan to employ open-source software that is accessible to the public in the creation of the multimedia yearbook, as well as existing equipment that will likely be found in any school, such as scanners, cameras and computers with CD/DVD burners. Our video program will cover all the necessary steps to publish a multimedia yearbook for a school or a club. It will be a series of instructional videos that will teach specific skills in the various areas of multimedia, and will include the following: Session 1* - Downloading & Setting up free image manipulation software Session 2* - How to use the free image manipulation software. Session 3 - Downloading & Setting up free video editor software. Session 4 - How to use the free video editor software Session 5 - Batch conversion (with image & video processing). Session 6 - Introduction to slideshows. Session 7 - How to build interactive menus. Session 8 - Introduction to an open source CD and DVD writing program. Session 9 - Design CD/DVD Label. Session 10 - How to burn the complete project. - ---------- * Already available on our website. Our video program will also include a complete "How to" guide designed for teachers. This guide will assist teachers to establish a class curriculum to study various aspects of producing a multimedia yearbook, and will cover the following areas, among others: division of labor between students, define primary tasks, choosing a main theme, collecting media content, editing, and final distribution. Our offices are currently located at 5348 Vegas Dr., Suite 112, Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. Our telephone number is (702) 441-0703. We have a website at http://www.easycdyearbook.com. The information contained on our website does not form a part of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. We have commenced only limited operations, primarily focused on organizational matters, initial product development efforts and efforts related to this offering. THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY Virtually all North American high schools and colleges, and many elementary and middle schools, publish yearbooks. UNITED STATES According to statistics made available by the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education - National Center for Education Statistics, there were 97,000 public elementary and secondary schools in the United States during 2005-2006, and an estimated 49.6 million students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools during 2007-08. In the private segment there were an estimated 6.1 million students enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools during 2007-08. 19 CANADA According to a Canada e-Book made available by Statistics Canada, Canada's National Statistical Agency, in 1999-2000, there were 16,024 elementary and secondary schools in Canada, only 4% of which had enrollments of 1,000 students or more (we do not currently have up to date information regarding the current number of schools in Canada). We plan to concentrate our marketing efforts primarily to elementary and high schools. These marketing efforts will be geared towards attracting elementary schools seeking an inexpensive substitute to the printed yearbook, and to high schools seeking an inexpensive multimedia supplement to their traditional yearbook. See "Marketing and Sales Strategy" below. COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGY We are not aware of any competitor or other entity offering a similar product focused on "How to publish a Multimedia Yearbook" that would compete with us in the online environment. Some of our potential competitors offer designated software to publish a multimedia yearbook for a school or a club. These include Yeardisk Creator by Yeardisk, Digital Journey by Digital Journey LLC, and My Old YearbookTM CD, by Edge Computer Consulting, Inc. These companies currently dominate the online multimedia yearbook market and we expect them to remain the dominant force for the time being. We believe our primary competitive advantage is that our product would enable schools and clubs to publish a low-budget multimedia yearbook as a replacement or supplement to their yearbook, as it requires only use of open source free software and existing equipment that would likely be found at any school. Further, our strategy is to emphasize that our video program will teach the skills and concepts of multimedia generally, which can be used for any multimedia project, including a multimedia yearbook. MARKETING & SALES STRATEGY Our marketing efforts will be directed towards building a network of relationships with schools and clubs in the North America. We will emphasize how our video program can be an inexpensive replacement or supplemental to the traditional printed yearbook, as well as a "green," or environmentally-friendly, alternative to the printed yearbook. Initially, we plan to gain a customer base through a targeted web campaign. We estimate that our initial marketing expenses for the first year will be approximately $8,000. We also intend to employ the following techniques: SEARCH ENGINES: Once our video program is ready for commercial use, we plan to submit our website to search engines that robotically index the Web. Such search engines include Google, Yahoo, MSN, AOL Search, and Ask.com. Some of these feed search content to the other main search engines and portal sites. RECIPROCAL LINKS: We plan to find complementary websites and request a reciprocal link to our website. INTERNET MARKETING: We plan to conduct Internet marketing such as advertising on news forums, web seminars, email campaigns, web advertising, e-newsletters, online public relations and issuing press releases. BRANDING: While it may initially be difficult for a start-up company to establish a consumer brand name, we realize the critical importance of making "POWERED BY EASY CD YEARBOOK" a symbol of quality in the marketplace. We will 20 insure wherever possible that this critical "branding experience" will appear on all of our services and web pages. We plan to price our product at $379 initially when downloaded or viewed online, and at a slightly higher price for a boxed version on DVD. We also plan to offer a discount to those schools and clubs that agree to link their website to our website. DISTRIBUTION Our video program will be available on DVD and as a direct download/view from our website. SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES We believe there are no constraints on the sources or availability of products and supplies related to our business. We will be producing our own product, and the distribution of our product will be over the Internet. DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS We plan on selling our video program and services directly to schools or clubs over the Internet. Our video program will be priced for mass market consumption. Therefore, we do not anticipate dependence on one or a few major customers for at least the next 12 months or the foreseeable future. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISE RESTRICTIONS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & CONCESSIONS We have not entered into any franchise agreements or other contracts that have given, or could give rise to, obligations or concessions. We are planning to produce a video program and intend to protect it with copyright and trade secrecy laws. We do not hold any other intellectual property. Easy CD Yearbook is planning to develop all of its own video and software content for the foreseeable future and intends to copyright or obtain other protection over these assets if and when it has the cash resources to do so. We do not hold any other intellectual property and we do not anticipate any additions in the foreseeable future. EFFECT OF EXISTING OR PROBABLE GOVERNMENT REGULATION We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND COSTS We have not incurred any research and development costs to date. We have plans to undertake certain research and development activities during the first two years of operation related to the development of our video program. . For additional details please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Plan of Operation" below. 21 FUTURE PLANS If we are successful and have the financial and cash resources to do so, we plan to expand our video program with complementary videos for other areas of multimedia. We also plan to expand our business from sales generation exclusively from the Internet to having our products sold to customers through other consumer channels such as retailers, wholesalers, or other direct sale methods. EMPLOYEES We have commenced only limited operations, and therefore currently have no employees other than our executive officers, who spend up to approximately 20 hours a week on our business. When we commence full operations, we expect to hire full-time management and administrative support staff. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY We do not own interests any real property. We currently maintain our corporate office at 5348 Vegas Dr., Suite 112, Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. We pay monthly rent of $75 for use of this space. This space is currently sufficient for our purposes, and we expect it to be sufficient until we commence full operations. REPORTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS We will voluntarily make available to our stockholders an annual report, including audited financials, on Form 10-K. We are not currently a reporting company, but upon effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will be required to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. You may obtain copies of these reports from the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. or on the SEC's website, at www.sec.gov. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. We will also make these reports available on our website. LEGAL MATTERS We know of no existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. Our address for service of process in Nevada is EastBiz.com, Inc., 5348 Vegas Dr., Suite 112, Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. MANAGEMENT The name, age and position of each of our directors and executive officers are as follows: 22 Name Age Position ---- --- -------- Almaymoon Mawji 32 President, Treasurer, and Director Zahirali Kaba 43 Secretary and Director MR. ALMAYMOON MAWJI Mr. Mawji is our President, Treasurer and a Director. He has served in these capacities since we were incorporated on June 27, 2006. From mid 1999 until February 2008, Mr. Mawji was the vice president of sales and enrollment for the Sunridge Child Learning Center in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He holds a BSc in Biological Sciences from the University of Calgary with a minor in business management. MR. ZAHIRALI KABA Mr. Kaba is our Secretary and a Director, and has served in these capacities since we were incorporated on June 27, 2006. Mr. Zahirali has been a self-employed businessman since 2000, involved in several areas of the economy in Tanzania, where he resides, which primarily includes the import and export of gemstones and other precious stones. He is also involved in the domestic mining of gemstones which supplies his gemstone export business. BOARD COMPOSITION Our Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, but not more than nine, and that our shareholders shall determine the number of directors at each regular meeting. Each director serves for a term that expires at the next regular meeting of the shareholders or until his successor is elected and qualified. COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS We do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee, compensation committee, nominating committee, executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. Nor do we have an audit committee "financial expert." As such, our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee and handles matters related to compensation and nominations of directors. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE We are not subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or national securities association and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our board comprised of a majority of "independent directors." Our determination of independence of directors is made using the definition of "independent director" contained in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"), even though such definitions do not 23 currently apply to us because we are not listed on NASDAQ. We have determined that none of our directors currently meet the definition of "independent" as within the meaning of such rules as a result of their current positions as our executive officers. SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES We have no significant employees other than the executive officers described above. FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS There are no familial relationships among any of our officers and directors. INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS No director, person nominated to become a director, executive officer, promoter or control person of our company has, during the last five years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to any federal or state securities or banking or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting involvement in any business activity, or finding any violation with respect to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy petition been filed by or against the business of which such person was an executive officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two years prior thereto. STOCKHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless, every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors, as applicable, and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications, and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year, our Board will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION We have not paid since our inception, nor do we owe, any compensation to our executive officers, Mr. Almaymoon Mawji, and Mr. Zahirali Kaba. We have no employment agreements with either of our executive officers. OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT 2008 FISCAL YEAR-END We do not currently have a stock option plan nor any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. No individual grants of stock options or other equity incentive awards have been made to any executive officer or any director since our inception; accordingly, none were outstanding at May 31, 2008. 24 EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS, TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS There are currently no employment or other contracts or arrangements with our executive officers. There are no compensation plans or arrangements, including payments to be made by us, with respect to our officers, directors or consultants that would result from the resignation, retirement or any other termination of such directors, officers or consultants from us. There are no arrangements for directors, officers, employees or consultants that would result from a change-in-control. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS We have not compensated our directors for their service on our Board of Directors since our inception. There are no arrangements pursuant to which directors will be compensated in the future for any services provided as a Director. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS Other than the transactions discussed below, we have not entered into any transaction nor are there any proposed transactions in which any of our directors, executive officers, stockholders or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing had or is to have a direct or indirect material interest. On June 27, 2006, pursuant to the terms of a subscription agreement, we sold 2,500,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Almaymoon Mawji, our President, Treasurer and Director, for cash payment to us of $0.001 per share, or $2,500 in the aggregate. On June 27, 2006 pursuant to the terms of a subscription agreement, we sold 3,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Zahirali Kaba, our Secretary and Director, for cash payment to us of $0.001 per share, or $3,000 in the aggregate. Our officers and directors may be considered promoters of the Company due to their participation in and management of the business since its incorporation. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of June 23, 2008 for: * each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock; * each of our executive officers; * each of our directors; and * all of our executive officers and directors as a group. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities identified in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to 25 applicable community property laws, and the address for each person listed in the table is c/o Easy Cd Yearbook Inc., 5348 Vegas Dr., Suite 112, Las Vegas, NV 89108 USA. The percentage ownership information shown in the table below is calculated based on 7,386,400 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of June 23, 2008. We do not have any outstanding options, warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock. Name of Amount and Nature of Percentage Title of Class Beneficial Owner Beneficial Ownership of Class - -------------- ---------------- -------------------- -------- Common Stock Almaymoon Mawji 2,500,000 33.85% President, Treasurer and Director Common Stock Zahirali Kaba 3,000,000 40.61% Secretary and Director All officers as a Group 5,500,000 74.46% We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of our Company. We do not have any issued and outstanding securities that are convertible into common stock. Other than the shares covered by the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we have not registered any shares for sale by security holders under the Securities Act. None of our stockholders are entitled to registration rights. DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us, we have been advised that it is the Securities and Exchange Commission's opinion that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in such act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 26 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS.

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE STATED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$) AND ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. OVERVIEW We are a development stage company with limited operations and no revenues from our business operations. We are planning to produce and market a video program called "How to publish a Multimedia Yearbook," which is a program that will be designed for teachers and students who wish to organize and publish a multimedia yearbook for their school or club. A multimedia yearbook is a CD/DVD that contains video, photos, audio and text that is PC and Mac compatible. Our product and services are currently in the development stage and are not ready for commercial sale. We anticipate our product will be available at the end of 2008. Our goal is to offer a process to an inexpensive electronic multimedia yearbook that can replace or be a supplement to the traditional printed yearbook. We plan to employ open-source software that is accessible to the public in the creation of the multimedia yearbook, as well as existing equipment that will likely be found in any school, such as scanners, cameras and computers with CD/DVD burners. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenues until we have completed development of our "How to publish a Multimedia Yearbook" video program. PLAN OF OPERATION We have not generated any revenues since our inception on June 27, 2006. We believe that our current funding will allow us to begin our product development, market our video program, and remain in business for 12 months. We intend to begin to generate revenues no earlier than the fiscal year of 2009. If we are unable to generate revenues within 12 months of the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part for any reason, or if we are unable to make a reasonable profit within 12 months of the effectiveness of the registration statement, we may have to suspend or cease operations. At 27 the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash. If we need additional funds, we may seek to obtain additional funds through additional private placement(s) of our securities or loans. We have no other financing plans at this time. Our business is premised on the theory that multimedia yearbooks will become the future standard, as they integrate the benefits of the printed yearbook and video yearbook into a CD/DVD. A multimedia yearbook contains text, images, audio, and video. While a traditional paper yearbook may contain a few dozen pages, a multimedia yearbook can contain hundreds or even thousands of pages. The end product of a multimedia yearbook is either a CD-ROM or a DVD that is PC and Mac compatible. We believe that there the multimedia yearbook will be the preferred form of yearbook for school and clubs, and thus there will be a market opportunity for our company for our product, because it offers several advantages over printed yearbooks. These include potential cost-savings, as there are currently high expenses associated with a printed yearbook, the capacity to include greater quantities of information in the electronic form of yearbook than can be held in a traditional printed yearbook, and the benefits to the environment as an electronic yearbook eliminates the need to cut and print such large quantities of paper. Our current business objectives are: * to engage a third party firm to produce our video program; * to publish the "How To" guide; * to execute our marketing plan and to create interest in our product; and * to establish our website as a major `hub' for instructional videos on multimedia. Our goals over the next 12 months are to: * produce our video program; * drive traffic to our website; * collect information and create customer lists from our website and email campaigns; * generate revenue by fiscal year of 2009; and * achieve break-even results of operations. ACTIVITIES TO DATE We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 27, 2006. We are a development stage company. From our inception to date, we have not generated any revenues, and our operations have been limited to organizational, start-up, and capital formation activities. Prior to the date hereof, we have secured shared office space for our corporate offices and created a brand logo for our business. We hired a third party website developer and launched our website at www.easycdyearbook.com. We have published a series of free instructional videos on our website to demonstrate our concept. EXPENDITURES The following chart provides an overview of our budgeted expenditures by significant area of activity over the next 12 months. These expenditures are described in detail below under "Milestones." 28 June 2008 to September 2008 to December 2008 to March 2009 June 2008 August 2008 November 2008 February 2009 to May 2009 to June 2009 ----------- ------------- ------------- ----------- ------------ Legal/Accounting $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 8,000 Transfer Agent 500 200 -- 200 900 Website Development 1,000 500 500 500 2,500 Video Production 7,000 7,000 -- -- 14,000 "How To" Guide 2,000 -- -- -- 2,000 Computer Equipment 700 700 700 700 2,800 Advertising/Marketing -- -- 4,000 4,000 8,000 Office Rent 225 225 225 225 900 Office Supply 250 250 250 250 1,000 Telephone 140 140 140 140 560 ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- $11,815 $ 9,015 $ 7,815 $ 8,015 $40,660 ======= ======= ======= ======= ======= MILESTONES JUNE - NOVEMBER 2008 Main Objectives: * Identify a contractor to produce our video program * Produce our video program * Publish "How To" guide During the next six months, we plan to identify a contractor and produce our video program. Our President and director, Mr. Mawji, will approach several video production contractors for the purpose of developing our video program. We will focus our efforts identifying a contractor that we believe will be able to execute our proposed video program in a costly and timely manner. The third party contractor's main duty will be to produce 10 instructional video sessions. We already identified those sessions that will teach how to publish a multimedia yearbook using open source software and existing equipment that can likely be found at any school. Our budget for the production of our video program is $14,000. DECEMBER 2008 - MAY 2009 Main Objectives: * Execute our marketing plan * Establish our website as a major `hub' for instructional videos on multimedia We plan to gain customer awareness by using a variety of different marketing initiatives such as: email campaigns, search engine promotions and web seminars, web advertising, e-newsletters, online public relations and press releases. 29 We will also focus our efforts by adding useful content to our website such as free instructional videos in different areas of multimedia, free knowledge base, free technical forum communities and useful links. Our management believes that by providing quality free video content we will attract customers to our website. We will be targeting K-12 schools and clubs in the North America. Both of our directors and officers will be performing this task. Our budget for the web marketing campaign is $8,000. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS During the period from June 27, 2006 (date of inception) through May 31, 2008, we incurred a net loss of $4,695. This loss consisted primarily of incorporation costs, administrative expenses and the design of our website. Since inception, we have sold 7,386,400 shares of common stock. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2008, the Company remained in the development stage and generated no revenue. The Company incurred net losses of $3,031 and $1,664 for the twelve month periods ending May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, respectively. General and administrative expenses were $811 for the year ended May 31, 2008, compared to $145 for the same period ended 2007. The Company also incurred $2,000 in consulting expenses during the year ended May 31, 2008, which were not incurred during the prior year. The increase in expenses during the year ended May 31, 2008 are attributed to an increase in development and organizational activities during the year ended May 31, 2008. PURCHASE OR SALE OF EQUIPMENT We have not purchased or sold, and we do not expect to purchase or sell, any plants or significant equipment over the twelve months. REVENUES We had no revenues for the period from June 27, 2006 (date of inception) through May 31, 2008. We believe that we will be able to commence the marketing and distribution of our product by the beginning of 2009, with revenues beginning no earlier than the fiscal year of 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our balance sheet as of May 31, 2008 reflects assets of $47,946. Cash and cash equivalents from inception to date have been sufficient to provide the working capital necessary to operate to date, and we expect it to help us remain operational during the next twelve months. Our activities to date have been supported by equity financing, through the private placements of our common stock on the date of our inception, June 27, 2006, and on March 31, 2008, through which we raised approximately $52,600. We have sustained losses in all previous reporting periods with an inception to date loss of $4,695 as of May 31, 2008. We anticipate generating losses and, 30 therefore, may be unable to continue operations in the future. We anticipate that in the future we will be required to seek funding from our stockholders and/or other qualified investors to pursue our business plan. If we require additional capital, we would have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATION Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the accompanying financial statements expressing concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS We do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. SEASONALITY We expect that our future sales will be impacted by seasonal demands, as we expect that sales will be tied to the school-year calendar, and concentrated during the spring semesters or the months closest to the ends of the traditional school year. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 31 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EASY CD YEARBOOK, INC.

(A Development Stage Company) We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Easy CD Yearbook, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) as of May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2008, May 31, 2007 and since inception on June 27, 2006 through May 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Easy CD Yearbook, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) as of May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2008, May 31, 2007 and since inception on June 27, 2006 through May 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $4,695, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 4. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Moore & Associates, Chartered - ----------------------------------------- Moore & Associates Chartered Las Vegas, Nevada June 4, 2008 2675 S.

(A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY 31, 2008 NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on June 27, 2006. The Company has limited operations and in accordance with SFAS #7, is considered a development stage company and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. As a development stage enterprise, the Company discloses the deficit accumulated during the development stage and the cumulative statements of operations and cash flows from inception to the current balance sheet date. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a May 31 fiscal year end. EARNINGS PER SHARE In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128"), which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. SFAS No. 128 supersedes the provisions of APB No. 15, and requires the presentation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 128 effective June 27, 2006 (inception). Basic earnings (loss) per share amount are computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments, consisting of accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of such instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial statements. F-6 EASY CD YEARBOOK, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D) MAY 31, 2008 INCOME TAXES Income taxes are provided in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Software development costs representing capitalized costs of design, configuration, coding, installation and testing of the Company's website up to its initial implementation. Upon implementation, the asset will be amortized to expense over its estimated useful life of three years using the straight-line method. Ongoing website post-implementation costs of operation, including training and application maintenance, will be charged to expense as incurred. See Note 5. NOTE 3. ADVERTISING The Company's policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company had not incurred any advertising expense as of May 31, 2008. NOTE 4. GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has net losses for the period from inception (June 27, 2006) to May 31, 2008 of $4,695. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. F-7 EASY CD YEARBOOK, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D) MAY 31, 2008 Management is planning to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. There can be no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all, and is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts. NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The officers and directors of the Company are involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. NOTE 6. WEBSITE Accumulated Cost Amortization Net Book Value ---- ------------ -------------- Website $1,276 $35 $1,241 Website costs are amortized on a straight line basis over 3 years, its estimated useful life. NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES The Company uses the liability method, where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. During fiscal 2008, the Company incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is $4,695 at May 31, 2008, and will expire in the year 2028. As at May 31, 2008, deferred tax assets consisted of the following: Net operating losses $ 704 Less: valuation allowance (704) ----- Net deferred tax asset $ -- ===== NOTE 8. NET OPERATING LOSSES As of May 31, 2008, the Company has a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $4,695, which will expire 20 years from the date the loss was incurred. F-8 EASY CD YEARBOOK, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D) MAY 31, 2008 NOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AUTHORIZED The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001. All common stock shares have equal voting rights, are non-assessable and have one vote per share. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they choose to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company. ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING For transactions other than those with employee's stock, issuances are in accordance with paragraph 8 of SFAS 123, where issuances shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received. Transactions with employee's stock issuance are in accordance with paragraphs (16-44) of SFAS 123, where issuances shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is the more reliable measure. On June 27, 2006, the Company issued 5,500,000 common shares to its directors for cash, valued at $0.001 per share or $5,500. Since inception (June 27, 2006) to the year ended May 31, 2008, the Company accepted subscriptions for 1,886,400 shares of common stock from 37 investors pursuant to a series of private placement transactions which closed on March 31, 2008. The private placements were not subject to any minimum investment, and were priced at $0.025 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $47,160. The Company accepted the subscriptions on March 31, 2008.

ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Our officers and directors are indemnified as provided by the Nevada Revised Statutes and by our Bylaws. Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, director immunity from liability to a company or its stockholders for monetary liabilities applies automatically unless it is specifically limited by a company's Articles of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation do not specifically limit our directors' immunity. Excepted from that immunity are: (a) a willful failure to deal fairly with the company or its stockholders in connection with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of interest; (b) a violation of criminal law, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful; (c) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal profit; and (d) willful misconduct. Our Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by Nevada law; provided, however, that we may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with our directors and officers; and, provided, further, that we shall not be required to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding, or part thereof, initiated by such person unless such indemnification: (a) is expressly required to be made by law, (b) the proceeding was authorized by our Board of Directors, (c) is provided by us, in our sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in us under Nevada law or (d) is required to be made pursuant to the Bylaws. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and control persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy, and is, therefore, unenforceable. ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES Since inception, we have issued unregistered securities to the persons, as described below. None of these transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions or any public offering, and we believe that each transaction was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") by virtue of Section 4(2) thereof, or Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated thereunder. All II-1 recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about us. On March 31, 2008, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,886,400 shares of our common stock to 37 non-US seed capital investors at a purchase price of $0.025 per share, without registration under the Securities Act, for total gross proceeds of $47,160. These shares were sold pursuant to subscription agreements accepted on March 31, 2008. We completed this offering pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act. We believed that this exemption from registration was available as each purchaser represented to us that they were a non-U.S. person as defined in Regulation S, and we did not engage in distribution of these shares in the United States. On June 27, 2006, pursuant to the terms of a subscription agreement, we sold 2,500,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Almaymoon Mawji, our President, Treasurer and Director, for cash payment to us of $2,500. We believe this issuance was deemed to be exempt under Regulation S of the Securities Act, as no advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the securities, the offering and sale was made only to Mr. Almaymoon Mawji who is a non-U.S. citizen, and transfer was restricted by us in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act. On June 27, 2006 pursuant to the terms of a subscription agreement, we sold 3,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Zahirali Kaba, our Secretary and Director, for cash payment to us of $3,000. We believe this issuance was deemed to be exempt under Regulation S of the Securities Act, as no advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the securities, the offering and sale was made only to Mr. Almaymoon Mawji who is a non-U.S. citizen, and transfer was restricted by us in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act.

II-2 UNDERTAKINGS The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"); (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this registration statement (or the most-recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement; (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Act to any purchaser, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. II-3 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the Registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada on June 25, 2008.
