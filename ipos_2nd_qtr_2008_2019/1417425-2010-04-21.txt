In this Prospectus, the terms “NXT Nutritionals,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. OVERVIEW We are a developer and marketer of a proprietary, patent-pending, all–natural, healthy sweetener sold under the brand name SUSTA™ and other food and beverage products. SUSTA™ is being sold as a stand-alone product and it is the common ingredient for all of our products. We also market and sell Healthy Dairy® which is enhanced by the revolutionary taste and nutritious ingredients contained in SUSTA™. Our mission is to provide consumers with unique, healthy, delicious products that promote a healthier lifestyle and combat obesity and diabetes. CORPORATE STRUCTURE Pursuant to a unit purchase agreement as of October 31, 2008, NXT Nutritionals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, acquired 100% of the membership interest in NXT, LLC and Healthy Dairy, two limited liability companies incorporated in the State of Delaware. In exchange, NXT Nutritionals, Inc. issued a total of 14,000,000 shares of its common stock to the unit holders of the Healthy Dairy and NXT, LLC and 6,000,000 shares of its common stock to Healthy Brands, LLC as a consultant to Healthy Dairy and NXT, LLC. As a result of the closing of the unit purchase, NXT, LLC and Healthy Dairy, LLC became the wholly owned subsidiaries of NXT Nutritionals, Inc. On February 12, 2009, we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement with NXT Nutritionals, Inc., and the NXT Shareholders, pursuant to which, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of NXT Nutritionals, Inc. from the NXT Shareholders. In exchange, we issued to the NXT Shareholders, their designees or assigns, 22,480,000 shares of our common stock or 63.06% of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding after the closing of the Share Exchange. As a result, NXT Nutritionals, Inc became our wholly owned subsidiary. BUSINESS We are a developer and marketer of a proprietary, patent-pending, all–natural, healthy sweetener sold under the brand name SUSTA™ and other food and beverage products. SUSTA™ is being sold as a stand-alone product and it is the common ingredient for all of the Company’s products. We also market and sell Healthy Dairy® which is enhanced by the revolutionary taste and nutritious ingredients contained in SUSTA™. Our initial focus will be to bring SUSTA™ to the retail marketplace nationwide, expand the Healthy Diary® product line from the east coast to nationwide reach, and eventually to expand the Healthy Dairy® to include product lines such as cup yogurt and ice cream. PRODUCTS SUSTA™ Natural Sweetener SUSTA™ is an all natural, healthy sweetener that has minimal calories and low glycemic index. It is a proprietary blend of inulin fiber, fructose, botanical extracts, natural flavors, vitamins, minerals, and probiotics that is patented in Australia and New Zealand and patent-pending in the U.S. and Canada. -1- SUSTA ™ is used in coffees, teas, other beverages, cereals, foods and any other foods that require a sweetener. SUSTA™ is targeted at individuals craving sweeteners but not the calories from sugar, and is feasible for people with diabetes. Not only does SUSTA™ sweeten the taste of food without all of the side effects of sugars or chemicals, it also contains healthy probiotics, vital dietary fiber, antioxidants and key cellular nutrients, leading to an increased metabolism. SUSTA™ simultaneously supports the health of bones, heart and immune system. Due to its revolutionary attributes, SUSTA™ is well positioned to be one of the leading natural alternative sweeteners in the marketplace. We will market SUSTA™ in three primary categories: · SUSTA TM as a table top sweetener alternative to sugar and other sweeteners, · SUSTA TM as an ingredient used in beverages, cereals, baked goods, dairy products, candy and chewing gum, and · NXT/SUSTA TM branded products including Healthy Dairy® and other SUSTA™ branded products to be launched by the Company. Brand awareness of SUSTA™ will be driven by our aggressive marketing campaign and our massive incent trial program. Additionally, more traditional levers in the retail sales channel like advertising, trade incentives, price promotions, couponing, and demonstrations will be employed. . We target consumer food and beverage companies to incorporate SUSTA™ into their products to provide a healthy alternative to sugar, artificial sweeteners and other natural sweeteners that do not provide the nutritional and health benefits of SUSTA™. Healthy Dairy® Yogurt Smoothies We have developed a line of SUSTA™ -enhanced best-in-class, non-fat reduced-calorie yogurt smoothies which are marketed as Healthy Dairy®. Healthy Dairy® which combines appealing packaging, the health benefits of SUSTA TM , and great taste, is offered in 5 different flavors: strawberry, peach, mixed berry, tropical fruit, and strawberry-banana. Healthy Dairy® represents our proof of concept for the taste and health benefits in SUSTA™ which is the primary sweetener in Healthy Dairy®. Healthy Dairy® contains cultured pasteurized skim milk, real fruit, pure cane sugar, soluble fiber, tapioca starch, natural flavors, phytosterols (plant sterols), SUSTA™, antioxidant botanicals, and many beneficial vitamins totaling 170 calories per bottle. Healthy Dairy® contains SUSTA™ and important nutrients that promote health and wellness with outstanding taste and sweetness with significantly fewer calories than our key competitors.

Before purchasing any of the shares of common stock, you should carefully consider the following factors relating to our business and prospects. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. In such case, you may lose all or part of your investment. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this process before investing in our common stock. Risks Relating to Our Business OUR LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY MAY NOT SERVE AS AN ADEQUATE BASIS TO JUDGE OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We have a relatively limited operating history. Such limited operating history and the unpredictability of the sweetener, and food and beverage industry makes it difficult for investors to evaluate our businesses and future operating results. An investor in our securities must consider the risks, uncertainties, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. The risks and difficulties we face include challenges in accurate financial planning as a result of limited historical data and the uncertainties resulting from having had a relatively limited time period in which to implement and evaluate our business strategies as compared to older companies with longer operating histories. WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. The revenues from the sales of our beverage products and the projected revenues from the sales of these products are not adequate to support our expansion and product development programs at this time. We will need substantial additional funds to: -4- · effectuate our business plan and expand our product line; · file, prosecute, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights; and · produce and market our products. There are no assurances that future funding will be available on favorable terms or at all. If additional funding is not obtained, we will need to reduce, defer or cancel development programs, planned initiatives, or overhead expenditures to the extent necessary. The failure to fund our capital requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the sale of additional equity securities to raise financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations that could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. NEWLY DEVELOPED PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH MARKET NEEDS RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND EARNINGS. Our business is particularly subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes, and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes. If we fail to invest in extensive market research on consumer health needs in each market we target, we may face limited market acceptance of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings. WE MAY ENCOUNTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN OUR BUSINESS AND FAILURE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE. We believe that existing and new competitors will continue to improve their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics. We expect that we will be required to continue to invest in product development and productivity improvements to compete effectively in our markets. Our competitors could develop more efficient products or undertake more aggressive and costly marketing campaigns than ours, which may adversely affect our marketing strategies and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include: · the taste and flavor of products; · trade and consumer promotions; · rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products; · attractive and different packaging; · branded product advertising; and · pricing In periods of reduced demand for our products, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our selling prices to meet competition or maintain selling prices, which would likely sacrifice market share. Sales and overall profitability would be reduced in either case. In addition, we cannot assure that additional competitors will not enter our existing markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition. WE RELY ON THE SERVICES OF CERTAIN KEY PERSONNEL. Our business relies on the efforts and talents of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Francis McCarthy. The loss of Mr. McCarthy’s service could adversely affect the operations of our business. Although we have entered into a two year employment agreement with Mr. McCarthy and Mr. McCarthy has not indicated any intention of leaving us, the loss of his service for any reason could have a very negative impact on our ability to fulfill on our business plan. -5- WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN OR HIRE SUCH PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE, OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTS AND IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, and our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Competition for senior management and senior technology personnel is intense, the pool of qualified candidates is very limited, and we may not be able to retain the services of our senior executives or senior technology personnel, or attract and retain high-quality senior executives or senior technology personnel in the future. Such failure could materially and adversely affect our future growth and financial condition. PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AGAINST US COULD RESULT IN ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES. As with other food producers, we are also exposed to risks associated with product liability claims if the consumption of our products results in injury or illness. We cannot predict what impact such product liability claims or resulting negative publicity would have on our business or on our brand image. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages, diversion of management resources and require us to make significant payments and incur substantial legal expenses, although we do carry product liability insurance for potential product liability claims. Even if a product liability claim is not successfully pursued to judgment by a claimant, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim. Finally, serious product quality concerns could result in governmental action against us, which, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, loss of certain licenses, or other governmental penalties. WE COMPETE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS BRAND-CONSCIOUS, AND UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN BRAND NAME RECOGNITION OUR SALES MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brand by our targeted consumers. In addition, our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors and consumers of our brand. Although we believe that we have made progress towards establishing market recognition for our brand in the industry, it is too early in the product life cycle of the brand to determine whether our products and brand will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors, grocery stores, retailers and consumers. WE RELY PRIMARILY ON THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND INDEPENDENT RETAILERS, AND THIS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY AND PROFITABLY DISTRIBUTE AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING MARKETS AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS INTO OTHER GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS. Except for the sales through the internet, we do not sell our products directly to our end customers. We primarily rely on third-party distributors and retailers for the sale and distribution of our products. To the extent that our distributors are distracted from selling our products or do not expend sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products, our sales will be adversely affected. Our ability to maintain our distribution network and attract additional distributors will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Some of these factors include: (i) the level of demand for our brand and products in a particular distribution area; (ii) our ability to price our products at levels competitive with those offered by competing products and (iii) our ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by distributors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet all or any of these factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. Furthermore, shortage of adequate working capital may make it impossible for us to do so. Our inability to achieve any of these factors in a geographic distribution area will have a material adverse effect on our relationships with our distributors in that particular geographic area, thus limiting our ability to maintain and expand our market, which will likely adversely affect our revenues and financial results. -6- OUR FUTURE SUCCESS RELIES UPON SUSTA™, ALL-NATURAL, PATENT-PENDING, HEALTHY SWEETENER. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE PATENTS WILL BE GRANTED. EVEN IF THEY ARE GRANTED, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ENFORCE THE PATENTS THROUGH LITIGATION OR OTHERWISE. THE LOSS OF EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO SUSTA COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We believe that our business does not infringe upon the valid proprietary rights of others, but there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. If infringement claims are brought against us, there can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources to defend against such claims or prevent an adverse judgment against us. In the event of an unfavorable ruling on any such claim, there can be no assurance that a license or similar agreement to utilize the intellectual property rights in question relied upon by us in the conduct of our business will be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. In the event of an unfavorable ruling on any such claim, there can be no assurance that a license or similar agreement to utilize the intellectual property rights in question relied upon by us in the conduct of our business will be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. SUSTA™ is patent-pending in the United States and Canada. There can be no assurance any of these pending patents will be granted or, even if they are, that we will have the resources to enforce these patents through litigation or otherwise. In addition, patents granted by the United States Patent Office do not guarantee that competitors in overseas locations will not imitate our products, or patent similar products in other nations. WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS AND, IF IT IS NOT AVAILABLE WHEN WE NEED IT, WE MAY NEED TO REDUCE OUR PLANNED DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING EFFORTS, WHICH MAY REDUCE OUR SALES REVENUES. We believe that our existing working capital and cash available from operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. The development and marketing of new products and the expansion of distribution channels and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources. In addition, if the markets for our products develop more slowly than anticipated, or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenues, we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital. As a result, we could be required to raise additional capital. We cannot assure that additional capital, if required, will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. WE MAY NEVER PAY ANY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Risks Related to Our Common Stock OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD WHICH MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR STOCK PRICE AND LIQUIDITY. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq system. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our Common Stock, could depress the trading price of our Common Stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. -7- THERE IS LIMITED LIQUIDITY ON THE OTCBB. When fewer shares of a security are being traded on the OTCBB, volatility of prices may increase and price movement may outpace the ability to deliver accurate quote information. Due to lower trading volumes in shares of our Common Stock, there may be a lower likelihood of one's orders for shares of our Common Stock being executed, and current prices may differ significantly from the price one was quoted at the time of one's order entry. OUR COMMON STOCK IS THINLY TRADED, SO YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL AT OR NEAR ASKING PRICES OR AT ALL IF YOU NEED TO SELL YOUR SHARES TO RAISE MONEY OR OTHERWISE DESIRE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR SHARES. Currently our Common Stock is quoted in the OTC Bulletin Board market and the trading volume we will develop may be limited by the fact that many major institutional investment funds, including mutual funds, as well as individual investors follow a policy of not investing in Bulletin Board stocks and certain major brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending Bulletin Board stocks because they are considered speculative, volatile and thinly traded. The OTC Bulletin Board market is an inter-dealer market much less regulated than the major exchanges and our Common Stock is subject to abuses, volatility and shorting. Thus there is currently no broadly followed and established trading market for our Common Stock. An established trading market may never develop or be maintained. Active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. Absence of an active trading market reduces the liquidity of the shares traded there. The trading volume of our Common Stock has been and may continue to be limited and sporadic. As a result of such trading activity, the quoted price for our Common Stock on the OTC Bulletin Board may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of its fair market value. Further, if we cease to be quoted, holders would find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our Common Stock and as a result, the market value of our Common Stock likely would decline. OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO PRICE VOLATILITY UNRELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our Common Stock. YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL YOUR COMMON STOCK AT OR ABOVE YOUR PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO YOU. The following factors may add to the volatility in the price of our common stock: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; government regulations, announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; our capital commitments; and additions or departures of our key personnel. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time, including as to whether our common stock will sustain its current market price, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price. -8- IF WE FAIL TO REMAIN CURRENT ON OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD, WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO SELL OUR SECURITIES AND THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. Companies trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, such as Revolutions Medical Corporation, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and must be current in their reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTC Bulletin Board. If we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTC Bulletin Board. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities could be adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of shareholders to sell their securities in the secondary market. INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY MAY BE SUBSJECT TO DILUTION CAUSED BY CONVERSION OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE AND/OR EXERCISE OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES A AND SERIES B WARRANTS. In connection with a private offering closed on August 27, 2009, we issued a number of 3-year convertible debentures, representing an aggregate principal amount of $3,173,000, which are convertible into shares of our Common Stock at $.40 per share at any time during the term of the convertible debentures, a number of Series A Warrants to purchase 100% of the underlying shares of Common Stock of the convertible debenture at an exercise price of $.40 per share and a number of Series B Warrants to purchase 100% of the underlying shares of Common Stock of the convertible debenture at an exercise price of $.60 per share. Upon conversion or exercise of the convertible debenture or the Series A and Series B Warrants, in whole or in part, your investment in the Company will be subject to significant dilution. WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL SERIES C WARRANTS TO PAY OFF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ACCRUED, WHICH WILL CAUSE DILUTON TO YOUR INVESTMENT. In connection with the private offering closed on August 27, 2009, we have not filed the registration statement by the required filing date of October 27, 2009 and are subject to liquidated damages in the amount of 1.0% of the aggregate amount invested in the private offering for every 30-day period or portion thereof, subject to the maximum amount of 9% of the purchase price in the offering. Our Management intends to negotiate with the investors in the private offering to obtain (1) their waiver of the liquidated damages, and/or (ii) their consent to the issuance of Series C Warrants as payment for the liquidated damages. If we issue to those investors Series C Warrants to pay off the liquidated damages, your ownership interest in the Company will be diluted upon their exercise of the Series C Warrants for Common Stock. OUR COMMON STOCK ARE CLASSIFIED AS A “PENNY STOCK” AS THAT TERM IS GENERALLY DEFINED IN THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO MEAN EQUITY SECURITIES WITH A PRICE OF LESS THAN $5.00. OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE SUBJECT TO RULES THAT IMPOSE SALES PRACTICE AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON BROKER-DEALERS WHO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING A PENNY STOCK. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called "penny stocks" to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. As of April 7, 2010, the closing sale price of our common stock was $0.52 per share and, therefore, it is designated a "penny stock." As a "penny stock," our Common Stock may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act of 1934, or the "Penny Stock Rule." This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors" (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. -9- The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth: The basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination, and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Because of these regulations, broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures and/or may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our Common Stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in any secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our Common Stock, if and when our Common Stock becomes publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our Common Stock may decrease, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our Common Stock. Our Common Stock, in all probability, will be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future and our shareholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their common stock. There can be no assurance that our Common Stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our Common Stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of a penny stock if the SEC determines that such a restriction would be in the public interest. Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling security holders. All of the net proceeds from the resale of our common stock will go to the selling security holders as described below in the sections entitled “Selling Security Holders” and “Plan of Distribution”. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders. A portion of the shares of common stock covered by this prospectus are issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. We may receive proceeds in the event some or all of the Warrants held by the selling security holders are exercised for cash. Any proceeds received from the exercise of the warrants will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Determination of Offering Price The prices at which the shares or common stock covered by this prospectus may actually be sold will be determined by the prevailing public market price for shares of common stock, by negotiations between the selling security holders and buyers of our common stock in private transactions or as otherwise described in “Plan of Distribution.” Dilution The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders are provided in Item 7 is common stock that is currently issued. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. Selling Security Holders The common shares being offered for resale by the selling security holders consist of 13,035,808 shares of our common stock held by 47 holders who were investors in our private placement of $5,667,743, through the sale of the Notes and (ii) a number of Series C Warrants exercisable into a number of shares of common stock equal to 100% of the number of common shares upon conversion of the principal amount of the Notes, that we closed on February 26, 2010. The principal amount of each Note is 115% of the subscription proceeds received. -10- The following table sets forth the name of the selling security holders, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each of the selling stockholders as of April 16, 2010 and the number of shares of common stock being offered by the selling stockholders. The shares being offered hereby are being registered to permit public secondary trading, and the selling stockholders may offer all or part of the shares for resale from time to time. However, the selling stockholders are under no obligation to sell all or any portion of such shares nor are the selling stockholders obligated to sell any shares immediately upon effectiveness of this prospectus. All information with respect to share ownership has been furnished by the selling stockholders.

To our knowledge, none of the selling shareholders or their beneficial owners: - has had a material relationship with us other than as a shareholder at any time within the past three years; or - has ever been one of our officers or directors or an officer or director of our predecessors or affiliates - are broker-dealers or affiliated with broker-dealers. Plan of Distribution This prospectus relates to the resale of up to 13,035,808 shares, including (i) 6,517,904 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, and (ii) 6,517,904 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series C Warrants, each held by certain selling security holders. Each selling stockholder of the common stock and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock covered hereby on the principal Trading Market or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A Selling Stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: -14- · ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; · block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; · purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; · an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; · privately negotiated transactions; · settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part; · in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; · through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; · a combination of any such methods of sale; or · any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440. In connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling stockholders may also sell shares of the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). The selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Each selling stockholder has informed the Company that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the Common Stock. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%). The Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the registration of the shares. The Company has agreed to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. -15- Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder. The selling stockholders have advised us that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the Selling Stockholders. We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares may be resold by the Selling Stockholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares of Common Stock covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the selling stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of the common stock by the selling stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act). Description of Securities We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $.001 and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001. As of April 16, 2010, 44,304,568 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, including shares issued pursuant to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement. (a) Common Stock . The holders of the common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws do not provide for cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Accordingly, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors standing for election. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefore. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in the assets remaining after payment of liabilities. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, conversion or redemption rights. (b) Preferred Stock . Our board of directors has the authority, within the limitations and restrictions in our amended articles of incorporation, to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series, without further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control without further action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common Stock, including voting rights, of the holders of our common Stock. In some circumstances, this issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock. We currently have no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

We also market and sell Healthy Dairy® which is enhanced by the revolutionary taste and nutritious ingredients contained in SUSTA™. Our mission is to provide consumers with unique, healthy, delicious products that promote a healthier lifestyle and combat obesity and diabetes. CORPORATE STRUCTURE Pursuant to a unit purchase agreement as of October 31, 2008, NXT Nutritionals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, acquired 100% of the membership interest in NXT, LLC and Healthy Dairy, two limited liability companies incorporated in the State of Delaware.

Our current corporate structure is illustrated in the figure below: -19- BUSINESS We are a developer and marketer of a proprietary, patent-pending, all–natural, healthy sweetener sold under the brand name SUSTA™ and other food and beverage products. SUSTA™ is being sold as a stand-alone product and it is the common ingredient for all of our products. We also market and sell Healthy Dairy® which is enhanced by the revolutionary taste and nutritious ingredients contained in SUSTA™. Our initial focus will be to bring SUSTA™ to the retail marketplace nationwide, expand the Healthy Diary® product line from the east coast to nationwide reach, and eventually to expand the Healthy Dairy® to include product lines such as cup yogurt and ice cream. PRODUCTS SUSTA™ Natural Sweetener SUSTA™ is an all natural, healthy sweetener that has minimal calories and low glycemic index. It is a proprietary blend of inulin fiber, fructose, botanical extracts, natural flavors, vitamins, minerals, and probiotics that is patented in Australia and New Zealand and patent-pending in the U.S. and Canada. SUSTA ™ is used in coffees, teas, other beverages, cereals, foods and any other foods that require a sweetener. SUSTA™ is targeted at individuals craving sweeteners but not the calories from sugar, and is feasible for people with diabetes. Not only does SUSTA™ sweeten the taste of food without all of the side effects of sugars or chemicals, it also contains healthy probiotics, vital dietary fiber, antioxidants and key cellular nutrients, leading to an increased metabolism. SUSTA™ simultaneously supports the health of bones, heart and immune system. -20- Due to its revolutionary attributes, SUSTA™ is well positioned to be one of the leading natural alternative sweeteners in the marketplace. We will market SUSTA™ in three primary categories: · SUSTA TM as a table top sweetener alternative to sugar and other sweeteners, · SUSTA TM as an ingredient used in beverages, cereals, baked goods, dairy products, candy and chewing gum, and · NXT/SUSTA TM branded products including Healthy Dairy® and other SUSTA™ branded products to be launched by the Company. Brand awareness of SUSTA™ will be driven by our aggressive marketing campaign and our massive incent trial program. Additionally, more traditional levers in the retail sales channel like advertising, trade incentives, price promotions, couponing, and demonstrations will be employed. . We target consumer food and beverage companies to incorporate SUSTA™ into their products to provide a healthy alternative to sugar, artificial sweeteners and other natural sweeteners that do not provide the nutritional and health benefits of SUSTA™. Healthy Dairy® Yogurt Smoothies We have developed a line of SUSTA™ -enhanced best-in-class, non-fat reduced-calorie yogurt smoothies which are marketed as Healthy Dairy®. Healthy Dairy® which combines appealing packaging, the health benefits of SUSTA TM , and great taste, is offered in 5 different flavors: strawberry, peach, mixed berry, tropical fruit, and strawberry-banana. Healthy Dairy® represents our proof of concept for the taste and health benefits in SUSTA™ which is the primary sweetener in Healthy Dairy®. Healthy Dairy® contains cultured pasteurized skim milk, real fruit, pure cane sugar, soluble fiber, tapioca starch, natural flavors, phytosterols (plant sterols), SUSTA™, antioxidant botanicals, and many beneficial vitamins totaling 170 calories per bottle. Healthy Dairy® contains SUSTA™ and important nutrients that promote health and wellness with outstanding taste and sweetness with significantly fewer calories than the Company’s key competitors. MARKET OPPORTUNITIES With a significant growth market, SUSTA™ is much more than a next generation standalone sweetener. We will use this all-natural product as the basis for a growing line of healthy food products. Healthy Dairy® is a SUSTA™-enhanced product. With SUSTA™ as the base sweetener, there is virtually no end to the development of products that we can produce or license that will have immediate appeal to the growing number of refined averse and health conscious consumers. SUSTA™ Natural Sweetener SUSTA™ is well-positioned to be a competitive natural alternative sweetener in the U.S. table top sweetener market. The rise in type-II diabetes and the epidemic proportion of obesity result in an increased market demand for minimal calorie, natural and healthy sweeteners. SUSTA™ is uniquely formulated to take advantage of this demand, and is targeted at individuals craving sweeteners but not the calories from sugar, and is feasible for people with diabetes. Our target demographics include: · Diabetics, individuals on diets, and those proactively managing obesity. Given today’s environment, with the increase in obesity and diabetes, this is a mass market product. · The most important group is that of head-of-household moms that bring healthy choices into the household. These moms, who range in age from 20 to 50 years old, make the key food purchase decisions for the household, are employed, and are concerned about health and fitness for their families. · Not far behind in terms of focus are consumers who shun synthetic sweeteners. This list is headed by consumers who have an affinity for natural products, many of whom are fanatical as it relates to purchasing natural products. Consumers are increasingly aware that “you are what you eat” – this awareness has led to a change in consumer behavior as evidenced by the growth of the organic and all natural food sector. · And finally, SUSTA™ aimed at those that have active lifestyles and are wellness advocates who tend to be sports enthusiasts, such as runners, bikers, climbers, walkers, devoted exercisers. -21- Healthy Dairy® Yogurt Smoothies Healthy Dairy®, now sold in thousands of stores in 14 states, has been exceedingly well-received in a short period of time. The drinkable yogurt market is a 6% share ($221 Million) of the $3.5 Billion yogurt market that is growing annually by 5% in the U.S. and 10% globally leaving much room for sustainable growth. In addition, the Healthy Dairy® production line can be extended to launch new products such as Healthy Dairy® yogurt cups and Healthy Dairy® ice creams which will generate more market opportunities for the Company. MARKETING STRATEGY Our initial efforts are focused on launching SUSTA™ into the U.S. table top sweetener market, and targeted at the natural sweeteners segment that is less entrenched and has less formidable competitors. Brand awareness of SUSTA™ will be driven by an aggressive marketing and public relations campaign and a massive sampling program. Additionally, more traditional levers like advertising, trade incentives, price promotions, couponing, and demonstrations will be employed. Because of the health benefits of SUSTA™, especially for diabetics, we will partner with a number of health organizations, including the American Diabetes Association. Consumers will be able to buy SUSTA™ products online with a percentage of each sale allocated toward such charitable organization with whom we partner. We will continue to engage a number of high profile celebrities as our spokesperson who will help drive awareness of SUSTA™ by appearing in commercials, making public appearances, heading our cause marketing campaign and appearing on popular television shows. Because an increasing number of consumers are learning and searching for information on the internet rather than via traditional advertising on TV or in print media, we will take advantage of social networking sites to enhance SUSTA™ brand awareness. Health Forum and SUSTA™ recipes contests will be part of our on-line strategy. We have also developed a medical advisory board whose mission is to advise us on scientific advances regarding our products as well as to communicate the health benefits of SUSTA™ to consumers. DISTRIBUTION SUSTA™ Natural Sweetener We intend to capture market share in the mainstream grocery channel that we have already begun penetrating with our Healthy Dairy® over the last two years, with several thousand locations up and down the East Coast. Leading brokers in the country, including C&S and United Distributors, have agreed to carry SUSTA™. Whole Foods, the leading natural grocery chain, has also agreed to carry SUSTA™. Management believes that our established relationships with these groups, through existing Healthy Dairy® sales, will allow us to quickly scale up our marketing efforts with SUSTA. Healthy Dairy® Yogurt Smoothies Healthy Dairy® recognizes the importance of the distribution and selling functions to a sustainable business and therefore implemented the following actions: · Contracted distribution with C&S Wholesale Grocers who has provided first-class warehousing & distribution services for over 85 years to many U.S. customers. With over 60 warehouse facilities throughout the United States, C&S Associates serve some of the largest supermarket chains in the nation. C&S Wholesale Grocers ensures fair grocery prices for retailers and consumers by: o Purchasing goods directly from the manufacturer o Storing stock in vast secure warehouse facilities -22- o Distributing products to independent grocery stores, supermarkets & military bases o Passing on great savings to consumers assuring quality products at the best prices The chart below indicates the stores currently carrying SUSTA™ and Healthy Dairy®: COMPETITION SUSTA™ Natural Sweetener SUSTA™’s major competitors in the table top sweetener market are: Splenda 61% market share Equal 13% market share Sweet’n Low 13% market share Other 13% market share includes a variety of competitors – best known brands/producers in this segment include NutraSweet, ADM, & Cargill ( Source: IRI – Information Resources International ) Although we compete against all of the products and companies listed, there are major differences between our SUSTA™ and the competitive field in the retail marketplace for alternative sweeteners. SUSTA™ is an all-natural, low calorie sweetener that contains a proprietary blend of probiotics, botanical extracts, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that is unique in the retail marketplace today. SUSTA™ as a nutritional sweetener aids in digestion and supports the immune system, is rich in fiber, nutrients, antioxidants and probiotics and is low glycemic. SUSTA™ is like a sugar-shield in the food we eat. SUSTA™ works with the body naturally to help tame and transform problem-making, fast absorbing sugars and carbohydrates, into slower absorbing, healthier protected energy . SUSTA™ provides vital dietary fiber, antioxidants and key cellular nutrients that are needed for a smoother running, more calorie efficient metabolism. And importantly, SUSTA™ nutrition supports the health of the bones, heart, and immune system. Management views Splenda, Equal, Sweet’N Low and Truvia (the most prominent of the all natural brands based on the Stevia plant) as its main competitors. We will position SUSTA™ as a healthy, all natural, low calorie alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners with our “Naturally Healthy, Naturally Sweet” campaign. -23- While McNeil Nutritionals has established Splenda as the dominant brand in the space, our management believes that with our differentiation marketing plan, which includes celebrity marketing, public relations, a major cause marketing program, and a massive sampling program, we will be ideally positioned to a) start off by taking market share from other all-natural sweeteners that do not have the features and health benefits of SUSTA™, and b) after establishing SUSTA™, we will begin to take market share from Splenda and the other major artificial sweetener brands. Executing this plan on a nationwide basis will be contingent on the Company’s ability to continue to raise capital. Healthy Dairy® Yogurt Smoothies Healthy Dairy® is the only major brand of yogurt smoothies that contains plant sterols, which may reduce the risk of heart disease and help lower cholesterol when combined with a low saturated fat and cholesterol diet. We believe that today’s consumers who are concerned about living longer and healthier lives will increasingly switch to Healthy Dairy® as consumer awareness of our products increases upon the launch of our advertising, celebrity marketing and public relations campaigns. Our product has high nutritional content, no fat and 1/3 less calories than our closest competitor. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Patent Following years of research and development, SUSTA™ has been developed into a proprietary formulation that is patented in New Zealand and Australia and patent-pending in United States and Canada. The patent for SUSTA™ is held by NXT, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NXT Nutritionals, Inc. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a carbohydrate modifying formulation or agent of synergistic ingredients, pertaining to the metabolism of mono and disaccharides. Metabolically, the formulation of the invention slows the absorption of sugars, modifies the release of insulin, and stabilizes blood sugar response. Additionally, the oral ingestion of the formulation of the invention prevents or reduces the formation of dental caries by inhibiting the metabolic capability of dental plaque-forming bacteria to convert sugars into erosive, tooth-decaying acids. The formulations of the invention provide direct and indirect positive effects on sugar metabolism and blood sugar response. Thus, the formulations of the invention, when consumed in normal amounts, do not adversely contribute or aggravate such conditions as obesity, diabetes, or dietary-based, hormone related hyperactivity such as that often described in young children. A formulation of the invention may be in liquid or dry form. That is, it may be in the form of a powder that comprises or contains the formulation, or in the form of a liquid, either an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid. In one preferred aspect, the invention provides a finished, water-based beverage, into which the formulation of the invention is incorporated. Moreover, the invention provides a finished water-based beverage, which is acidified and which includes a formulation of the invention. The invention also includes a method of slowing absorption of sugars, for instance, from the intestine of a subject (including but not limited to a human individual), that comprises administering to the subject, or making available for ingestion by the mammal, a formulation of the invention. The formulation becomes effective when in an aqueous medium, which may be provided extrinsically, for instance by oral or intravenous administration or ingestion of an aqueous liquid containing the formulation, or intrinsically, for instance by ingestion of a solid formulation of the invention which is acted on by the body’s digestive secretions and conveyed to and through the body’s digestive system (an aqueous environment). Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description as follows: -24- DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention provides a formulation having desirable properties built upon synergistic ingredients; maintaining low simple sugar levels; and slowing down the normally rapid absorption of simple sugars from the gut. This objective best optimizes energy levels by thwarting the potential destabilizing effects on blood sugar and insulin response, by preferably utilizing a polysaccharide matrix of complex carbohydrates and soluble gum fibers. The invention provides numerous advantages not found in other agents including, but not limited to, limiting the effects of excessive use of ingredients, such as sugar, that may promote greater oxidative stress and actually reduce energy. Ingredients are preferably chosen from among those that neutralize and inhibit free radical production and oxidative stress and, therefore, help to protect the cellular energy generating mechanisms. Moreover, presently preferred ingredients are those that assist in the cellular utilization and burning of fuels for energy. The composition of the invention also provides multiple tiered uses of various timed caloric energy fuels plus the sweetness system disclosed herein for longer, sustained energy. Trademark NXT Nutritionals also owns several registered trademarks, including Healthy Dairy®, which applies to its all natural line of dairy products including our Healthy Dairy® non fat yogurt smoothies, and SUSTA: Turns Calories into Healthy Energy®.

The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low bid prices for our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board as reported by various OTCBB market makers. The quotations do not reflect adjustments for retail mark-ups, mark-downs, or commissions and may not necessarily reflect actual transactions.

The decrease is primarily attributable to low sales from two of the Company’s major distributors as well as the sharp decline in the United States economy. The Company also launched the natural sweetener product (SUSTA) on April 30, 2009. The Company has experienced limited sales on the SUSTA product. Gross Profit: Gross profit decreased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease is primarily attributable to offering significant discounts and favorable terms with our distributors and customers in an effort to maintain and increase brand awareness, and increased slotting fees. The Company also realized an increase in the cost of raw materials during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses increased 475% during the year ended December 31, 2009, up to $6,906,598 from $1,200,719 during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a significant increase in professional and consulting fees associated with the Company complying with SEC reporting requirements. The Company also issued stock based compensation to two celebrities for the use of their name and likeness during 2009, resulting in a significant expense. Other Income and Expenses: Other income and expenses increased by approximately $(16,927,277) to $(16,982,672) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $(55,395) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to the loss on extinguishment recognized when bridge investors converted into the new offering which was closed on August 27, 2009, to liquidated damages incurred, to the interest on the Company’s notes to related parties, interest accrued on convertible notes, amortization of debt discount of the discounts incurred on the issuance of the convertible notes, and amortization of debt issuance costs incurred on the raise of convertible notes. Provision for Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are determined based on the tax effect of items subject to differences in book and taxable income. The Company had no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. There is approximately $19,208,000 of net operating loss carry-forwards, which expire in 2029. See Note 8 of the 2009 and 2008 financial statements for tables and a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the statutory federal rate (34%) for continuing operations. -28- Going Concern: As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $(23,952,894) during the year ended December 31, 2009, and as of that date, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $1,535,693. Those factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management of the Company plans to address this concern by doing the following: ▪ Raising additional capital convertible note offerings ▪ Securing favorable raw material and manufacturing rates with our vendors ▪ Continuing to increase brand awareness for Healthy Dairy Yogurt Smoothies and the SUSTA Brand. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to do all or most of the above listed steps. As illustrated above, the Company has already been successful in setting its plan in action and looks forward to further progress as the year progresses. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. Year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Increase/(Decrease) Current Assets $ 291,206 $ 582,925 $ (291,719 ) Current Liabilities $ 1,826,899 $ 2,286,851 $ (459,952 ) Working Capital (Deficit) $ (1,535,693 ) $ (1,703,926 ) $ (168,233 ) As of December 31, 2009, we had a working capital deficit of $1,535,693 as compared to a working capital deficit of $1,703,926 as December 31, 2008, a decrease of $168,233. The decrease is primarily a result of the Company incurring increased expenses for professional and consulting fees. The Company’s sales have decreased by approximately $1,360,000 and the corresponding accounts receivable balance has decreased by $135,527. The decrease is also a result of a decrease in related party loans and convertible notes along with an decrease in cash of $205,744, an decrease in accounts receivable of $135,527, an increase in inventory of $82,552, and a decrease of prepaid expenses of $33,000. Net cash used for operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $(2,115,070) and $(837,546), respectively. The Net Loss for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $(23,952,894) and $(864,260) respectively. Net cash obtained through all financing activities for year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,909,326 as compared to $1,042,925 for the year ended December 31, 2008. Management anticipates being able to fund the Company’s foreseeable liquidity requirements through the $5.7M secured convertible note offering the company closed in February 2010. The Company continues to explore potential expansion opportunities in the industry in order to boost sales, while leveraging distribution systems to consolidate lower costs. -29- Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which amends previous guidance to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as annual financial statements in the current economic environment. This pronouncement was effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations; however, these provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820 resulted in additional disclosures with respect to the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events,” which establishes general standards of accounting for, and disclosures of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This pronouncement was effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial position; however, the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 855 resulted in additional disclosures with respect to subsequent events. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance now codified as FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” as the single source of authoritative non-governmental U.S. GAAP. FASB ASC Topic 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. All existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the FASB Codification will be considered non-authoritative. These provisions of FASB ASC Topic 105 were effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and, accordingly, were effective for the Company for the current fiscal reporting period. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations, but will impact the Company’s financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre-codification standards. On the effective date of FASB ASC Topic 105, the Codification superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards, and all other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became non-authoritative. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updated guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. This update requires new disclosures on significant transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (including the reasons for these transfers) and the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3. This update also requires a reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis. In addition to these new disclosure requirements, this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements. For example, this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities. This update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. This update will become effective for the Company with the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will become effective for the Company with the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2011. The Company will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes. Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this update will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. -30- Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies and procedures, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition The Company records revenue for both the yogurt smoothie and for the natural sweetener when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the product is delivered, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the related customer receivable is reasonably assured. There is no stated right of return for products. Sales are recognized upon shipment of products to customers. The Company allows deductions in the form of credits for products unsold during its shelf life which is on average 3 to 4 months. The Company’s reserve for accounts receivable takes these potential future credits into consideration. Beneficial Conversion Feature For convertible debt issued in 2009, the convertible feature (See Note 5) indicated a rate of conversion that was below market value. As a result, the Company recorded a "beneficial conversion feature" ("BCF") and related debt discount. When the Company records a BCF, the relative fair value of the BCF would be recorded as a debt discount from the face amount of the respective debt instrument. The discount would be amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. At each commitment date during 2009, the convertible debt instruments had an effective conversion rate per share in excess of the market price per share. Stock-based compensation Generally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards’ grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable. The expense resulting from share-based payments are recorded in cost of goods sold or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations, depending on the nature of the services provided. -31- OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities” (SPEs). CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE On February 12, 2009, we dismissed Gately & Associates, LLC ("Gately") as our independent registered public accounting firm following the change in control of the Company on the closing of the Share Exchange on February 12, 2009. The Company engaged Gately to audit its financial statements for the period from April 25, 2006 (inception) to December 31, 2007. The decision to change accountants was approved and ratified by the Company’s Board of Directors. The report of Gately on the financial statements of the Company for the period from April 25, 2006 (inception) ended December 31, 2007 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle. Additionally, during period from the Company’s inception (April 25, 2006) to December 31, 2007, there were no disagreements with Gately on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure. While Gately was engaged by the Company, there were no disagreements with Gately on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure with respect to the Company, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of Gately would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report on the Company’s financial statements for period from April 25, 2006 (inception) to December 31, 2007. We engaged Berman & Company P.A. as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm as of February 12, 2009.

The Company also has a consulting agreement with Bartolomei Pucciarelli, LLC, a related party to Mr. Briones, to provide accounting and tax services pursuant to which Mr. Briones will receive a total of 200,000 of our common shares over a two year time period. A copy of the employment agreement was filed on a Form 8-K on February 12, 2009 and is incorporated herein by reference. Family Relationships None. Conflicts of Interest Certain potential conflicts of interest are inherent in the relationships between our officers and directors, and us. From time to time, one or more of our affiliates may form or hold an ownership interest in and/or manage other businesses both related and unrelated to the type of business that we own and operate. These persons expect to continue to form, hold an ownership interest in and/or manage additional other businesses which may compete with ours with respect to operations, including financing and marketing, management time and services and potential customers. These activities may give rise to conflicts between or among the interests of us and other businesses with which our affiliates are associated. Our affiliates are in no way prohibited from undertaking such activities, and neither we nor our shareholders will have any right to require participation in such other activities. Further, because we intend to transact business with some of our officers, directors and affiliates, as well as with firms in which some of our officers, directors or affiliates have a material interest, potential conflicts may arise between the respective interests of us and these related persons or entities. We believe that such transactions will be effected on terms at least as favorable to us as those available from unrelated third parties. With respect to transactions involving real or apparent conflicts of interest, we have adopted policies and procedures which require that: (i) the fact of the relationship or interest giving rise to the potential conflict be disclosed or known to the directors who authorize or approve the transaction prior to such authorization or approval, (ii) the transaction be approved by a majority of our disinterested outside directors, and (iii) the transaction be fair and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized or approved by our directors. Term of Office Our directors are appointed for a one-year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our shareholders or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board. All officers and directors listed above will remain in office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. There are no agreements with respect to the election of directors. We have not compensated our directors for service on our board of directors, any committee thereof, or reimbursed for expenses incurred for attendance at meetings of our board of directors and/or any committee of our board of directors. Officers are appointed annually by our board of directors and each executive officer serves at the discretion of our board of directors. We do not have any standing committees. Our board of directors may in the future determine to pay directors’ fees and reimburse directors for expenses related to their activities. -37- None of our officers and/or directors have filed any bankruptcy petition, been convicted of or been the subject of any criminal proceedings or the subject of any order, judgment or decree involving the violation of any state or federal securities laws within the past five (5) years. Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings To our knowledge, during the past five (5) years, none of our directors, executive officers, promoters, control persons, or nominees has been: § the subject of any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; § convicted in a criminal proceeding or is subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); § subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or § found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law. The Audit Committee Members: David Deno and Mark Giresi We have a separately-designated standing audit committee established as contemplated by Section 10A of the Exchange Act. The board of directors has determined that Mr. Deno is an “audit committee financial expert”, as that term is defined by the SEC in Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K. Stockholders should understand that this designation is an SEC disclosure requirement relating to Mr. Deno’s experience and understanding of certain accounting and auditing matters, which the SEC has stated does not impose on the director so designated any additional duty, obligation or liability than otherwise is imposed generally by virtue of serving on the audit committee and/or the board of directors. The audit committee’s responsibilities include, among other things, (i) assisting the board of directors in its oversight of our compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, which includes oversight of the quality and integrity of our financial reporting, internal controls, and audit functions, and (ii) direct and sole responsibility for the appointment, retention, compensation, and monitoring of the performance of our independent registered public accounting firm. Potential Conflicts of Interest We are not aware of any current or potential conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors. Compliance With Section 16(A) Of The Exchange Act. Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are required to furnish copies to the Company. To the best of the Company’s knowledge, any reports required to be filed were timely as of the date hereof. -38- EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table shows for the periods indicated, compensation awarded to or paid to, or earned by, our officer and director.

Our directors and officers are indemnified as provided by the Delaware corporate law and our Bylaws. We have agreed to indemnify each of our directors and certain officers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions described above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than our payment of expenses incurred or paid by our director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. We have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction. We will then be governed by the court’s decision. -41- NXT NUTRITIONALS HOLDINGS, INC.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included the consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $23,952,894 and net cash used in operations of $2,115,070 for the year ended December 31, 2009; and has a working capital deficit of $1,535,693, and a stockholders' deficit of $3,319,708 at December 31, 2009. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plan in regards to the matters is also described in Note 3. Berman & Company, P.A.

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the following: the fair value of warrants granted, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating losses. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. Risks and uncertainties The Company operates in an industry that is subject to intense competition and change in consumer demand. The Company's operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks including the potential risk of business failure. The Company has experienced, and in the future expects to continue to experience, variability in sales and earnings. The factors expected to contribute to this variability include, among others, (i) the cyclical nature of the grocery industry, (ii) general economic conditions in the various local markets in which the Company competes, including the general downturn in the economy over the past year, (iii) the volatility of prices pertaining to food and beverages in connection with the Company’s distribution of product, and (iv) effective use of slotting fees paid as well as advertising. These factors, among others, make it difficult to project the Company’s operating results on a consistent basis. F-6 NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008 Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution. The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable represents trade obligations from customers that are subject to normal trade collection terms. The Company periodically evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable and considers the need to establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collection experience and specific customer information. Accordingly, the actual amounts could vary from the recorded allowances. The Company does not charge interest on past due receivables. Receivables are determined to be past due based on payment terms of original invoices. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, the Company did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) valuation method.

For purpose of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The carrying amounts of the Company’s short term financial instruments, approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments. Beneficial Conversion Feature For convertible debt issued in 2009, the convertible feature (See Note 5) indicated a rate of conversion that was below market value. As a result, the Company recorded a "beneficial conversion feature" ("BCF") and related debt discount. When the Company records a BCF, the relative fair value of the BCF would be recorded as a debt discount from the face amount of the respective debt instrument. The discount would be amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. At each commitment date during 2009, the convertible debt instruments had an effective conversion rate per share in excess of the market price per share. Original Issue Discount For certain convertible debt issued in 2009, the Company provided the debt holder with an original issue discount. The original issue discount was equal to three years of simple interest at 10% of the proceeds raised. The original issue discount was recorded to debt discount reducing the face amount of the note and is being amortized to interest expense over the maturity period of the debt. Derivative Financial Instruments Fair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments, and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments. Once determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives. In addition, the fair value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are also valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, the Company did not have any derivative financial instruments. F-8 NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008 Segment information During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, the Company only operated in one segment; therefore, segment information has not been presented. Revenue recognition The Company records revenue for both the yogurt smoothie and for the natural sweetener when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the product is delivered, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the related customer receivable is reasonably assured. There is no stated right of return for products. Sales are recognized upon shipment of products to customers. The Company allows deductions in the form of credits for products unsold during its shelf life which is on average 3 to 4 months. The Company’s reserve for accounts receivable takes these potential future credits into consideration. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had no reserves. Expenses such as slotting fees and sales discounts are accounted for as a direct reduction of revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded slotting fees and discounts of $127,269 and $641,319, respectively. Cost of sales Cost of sales represents costs directly related to the production and manufacturing of the Company’s yogurt smoothie products. Costs include product development, freight, packaging and print production costs. Advertising Costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising for the Company are charged to operations as incurred. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Year Ended December 31, 2008 $3,019,962 $584,120 Stock-based compensation Generally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards’ grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable. The expense resulting from share-based payments are recorded in cost of goods sold or general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations, depending on the nature of the services provided. F-9 NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008 Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ,” which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 740-20, “Income Taxes – Intraperiod Tax Allocation,” clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740-20 by prescribing guidance for the recognition, de-recognition and measurement in financial statements of income tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FASB ASC Topic 740-20 requires that any liability created for unrecognized tax benefits is disclosed. The application of FASB ASC Topic 740-20 may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets. The Company would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, the Company did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Earnings per share In accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share,” basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The Company had the following potential common stock equivalents at December 31, 2009: Convertible debt – face amount of $3,665,338, conversion price of $0.40 9,163,345 Common stock warrants, conversion price of $0.40 (Series “A”) and $0.60 (Series “B”) 21,906,781 Total common stock equivalents 31,070,126 The Company had the following potential common stock equivalents at December 31, 2008: Convertible debt – face amount of $800,000, conversion price of $0.40 2,000,000 Common stock warrants, conversion price of $0.40 (Series “A”) 2,000,000 Total common stock equivalents 4,000,000 F-10 NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008 Since the Company reflected a net loss in 2009 and 2008, respectively, the effect of considering any common stock equivalents, if outstanding, would have been anti-dilutive. A separate computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share is not presented. In connection with the reverse acquisition and recapitalization, all share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated. Recent accounting pronouncements In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 820, “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which amends previous guidance to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as annual financial statements in the current economic environment. This pronouncement was effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations; however, these provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820 resulted in additional disclosures with respect to the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 855, “ Subsequent Events ,” which establishes general standards of accounting for, and disclosures of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This pronouncement was effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial position; however, the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 855 resulted in additional disclosures with respect to subsequent events. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance now codified as FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 105, “ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ,” as the single source of authoritative non-governmental U.S. GAAP. FASB ASC Topic 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. All existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the FASB Codification will be considered non-authoritative. These provisions of FASB ASC Topic 105 were effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and, accordingly, were effective for the Company for the current fiscal reporting period. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations, but will impact the Company’s financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre-codification standards. On the effective date of FASB ASC Topic 105, the Codification superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards, and all other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became non-authoritative. F-11 NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008 In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updated guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. This update requires new disclosures on significant transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (including the reasons for these transfers) and the reasons for any transfers in or out of Level 3. This update also requires a reconciliation of recurring Level 3 measurements about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis. In addition to these new disclosure requirements, this update clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements. For example, this update clarifies that reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities. This update also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. This update will become effective for the Company with the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will become effective for the Company with the interim and annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2011. The Company will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes. Other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this update will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Note 3 Going Concern and Liquidity As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $23,952,894 and net cash used in operations of $2,115,070 for the year ended December 31, 2009; and has a working capital deficit of $1,535,693, and a stockholders’ deficit of $3,319,708. The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on Management's plans, which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The Company may need to incur additional liabilities with certain related parties to sustain the Company’s existence. The Company will require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well as to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company believes its current available cash along with anticipated revenues may be insufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In February 2010, the Company issued secured convertible notes and warrants for net proceeds of approximately $5,700,000 (See Note 10 (B)). The Company believes that the utilization of its unique ingredient “SUSTA” will allow new product development that will provide future positive cash flows, however, sales to date have been nominal. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies Litigations, Claims and Assessments From time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm its business. The Company is currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that they believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse affect on its business, financial condition or operating results. F-21 NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008 Note 8 Income Taxes At December 31, 2009, the Company has a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $19,208,000 available to offset future taxable income expiring through 2029. Utilization of these net operating losses may be limited due to potential ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2009 was $7,735,000. The net change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2009 was an increase of $7,418,400. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, Management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2009. The effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Net operating loss carry forward $ 7,735,000 $ 317,000 Valuation allowance (7,735,000 ) (317,000 ) Net deferred tax asset $ - $ - There was no income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 due to the Company’s net losses. The Company’s tax expense differs from the “expected” tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, (computed by applying the Federal Corporate tax rate of 34% to loss before taxes and 9.5% for State Corporate taxes, the blended rate used was 41%), as follows: F-22 NXT Nutritionals Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 and 2008 December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Current federal tax expense $ (7,370,000) $ (266,000) Current state tax expense (2,276,000) (82,000) Non-deductible stock comp 1,911,000 31,000 Change in Potential NOL benefits 7,735,000 317,000 Change in valuation allowance (7,735,000 ) (317,000 ) Income tax expense $ - $ - The following is a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the United States federal income tax rate to the income taxes reflected in the statement of operations: December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Tax expense (credit) at statutory rate-federal (31%) (31%) State tax expense net of federal tax (10%) (10%) Changes in valuation allowance 41% 41% Tax expense at actual rate 0% 0% Note 9 Employment Agreements On February 12, 2009, the Company entered into two employment agreements with its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The terms of the agreements are as follows: (1) CEO ● 3 year term ● $120,000 annual salary (2) CFO ● 2 year term ● Cash for services rendered by the CFO’s accounting firm at a fixed rate of $39,000 per year. ● 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, having a fair value of $2,000 ($0.01/share), based upon the fair value of services rendered to third parties for services rendered.

Full ratchet provision – The notes contain a provision in which the conversion price can be reduced in any event the Company issues any security or debt instrument with a lower consideration per share in any future offering.
