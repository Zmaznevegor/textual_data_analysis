This summary does not contain all of the information you should consider before investing in our securities. You should read the entire prospectus, including Risk Factors and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes before making an investment decision. We, us, our company, our, Endurance Exploration and the Company refer to the combined business of Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, but do not include the shareholders of Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. Business Overview Our Corporate History and Background We were incorporated as Tecton Corporation, a Nevada corporation, on January 19, 2006, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hemis Corporation. On December 1, 2006, Hemis declared a dividend of Tecton shares to all shareholders as of that date and concurrently cancelled its share ownership Tecton. The effect of this dividend declaration and share cancellation was that Tecton was spun off as an independent company. On January 2, 2014, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. As used in this report, the terms we, us, our, Endurance and the Company mean Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation), unless otherwise indicated. Prior to June 2008, we were engaged in the exploration and acquisition of uranium properties that were either past producers or had been the subject of prior work programs and/or contained historic resources. On or about June 1, 2008, we ceased/discontinued operations of our uranium exploration activities; and had incurred to that point a net operating loss of approximately $5,600,000 since inception as we have sought to restructure and find a suitable business opportunity. We were deemed a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, from the discontinuance of operations in 2008 until the filing of our Form 8-K on December 31, 2013, relating to the acquisition of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC, on that date. Endurance Exploration Group, LLC On December 31, 2013, we completed the purchase of 100% of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (Endurance LLC), from its members in exchange for 20,550,539 shares of our common stock. Micah Eldred, who serves as our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Carl Dilley who serves as one of our directors and our Vice President, were the owners of all of the interests in Endurance LLC. Messrs. Eldred and Dilley were also the beneficial owners of a majority of our common stock at the time. Endurance LLC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, and its operations are now our primary focus. Endurance LLC was formed in 2009 to explore, from an operational and financial perspective, the feasibility and potential economic return of recovering historic and modern day shipwreck cargos. Based on the business started by Endurance LLC, we have developed a research methodology with three goals. The first goal is to establish a comprehensive understanding of the larger economic, technological and social trends that lead to the transport of physical wealth across oceans during different historical periods, along with creating a High Interest list of shipwrecks and their cargos lost across various historical periods. Conflict, accidents and acts of nature claimed a percentage of all voyages, and many of the shipwrecked vessels are believed to have carried a valuable cargo. The second objective is to identify, from this population of potential shipwreck losses, those shipwrecks that could be legally salvaged and recovered, and the cargos sold, with a positive return on the capital investment required for their location and recovery. The third goal is to move those projects which had the potential to generate positive investment returns into an operational phase with a high, risk-adjusted, chance of success; and, to develop a portfolio of projects in various stages of research, search, survey and recovery. 8 To that end, we have evaluated historical shipwreck databases holding in excess of 125,000 entries as well as undertaken contextual and keyword library and archival searches. It is important to note that even these massive repositories of data reflect just a small percentage of the 3,000,000+ shipwrecks the United Nations estimates lay on the ocean floor. From these databases and other searches, we have developed an initial High Interest list of approximately 400 shipwrecks. Using criteria including (but not limited to) depth, potential search area, legal concerns, difficulty of excavation and potential value, we further culled the High Interest list to approximately two-dozen targets, the Target List. In order for a shipwreck to qualify for our Target List, and to potentially move forward as an Operational Target (OT) -one that we may consider for the search and survey operation phase- the shipwreck must possess the following criteria: Known Cargo of Value. Based upon the historical and archival records, an OT must contain a quantifiable cargo of value. While the historical records may not provide our researchers with an exact present day value of a potential cargo, we must be able to determine a quantifiable range of its estimated value based upon cargo manifests or other archival documents. Known Navigational Data . Our research must provide information that would allow us to establish a geographically definable search and sinking location and, subsequently, an economically feasible search area for any potential target. Legal Salvage and Clear Path to Title. Admiralty law, salvage law, and various sovereign nations laws and regulations concerning the search and salvage of historical and modern shipwrecks are complex. Prior to pursuing an OT, we must be able to establish a clear legal path to the title of any potential recovery, and search and recovery must be made in compliance with international laws and regulations or under specific country permissions. Potential Returns Exceed Risk-Adjusted Cost of Search and Recovery. Prior to moving a shipwreck from our Target List to an Operational Target, we evaluate a large number of factors to determine the potential search and recovery costs, and the risks associated with such search and recovery. Items considered include: a targets location and likely depth, its location from the nearest operational port, the complexity and costs of potential search and salvage, legal issues to title, and many other factors; and, we develop an initial search plan and budget for each potential project. We recognize the high risk, yet potentially high rewards, of our business; and, we realize that we will not be successful finding or salvaging every project we undertake. Therefore, prior to moving any project onto the Operational Target list, we take a risk-adjusted approach to the potential returns that a project can provide; and we determine if, on a risk-adjusted basis, the potential target is economically feasible and appropriate to add to our portfolio of Operational Targets. Project  Connaught has now reached operational status. For project Connaught we have now surveyed over 700 square miles in the Western Atlantic Ocean in search of a sunken passenger liner carrying a substantial cargo of gold coinage. In addition to this manifest cargo, we also expect to find additional valuables among the personal stores of the ships passengers. In October of 2014 we announced the discovery of the steamship Connaught . In July 2015, we were granted exclusive salvage rights by the US Federal Courts. Please refer to Current & Ongoing Projects for additional information. For pre-operational project  Black Marlin , in November 2013, Endurance LLC entered into a contract with the sovereign government of an island nation in the Indian Ocean. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for and recover the Black Marlin and her silver cargo. Net proceeds of our recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split between us (75%) and the island government (25%). This contract also allows for other potentially valuable targets of opportunity within the territorial waters of this nation. We are currently pursuing an option to extend the existing contract. Please refer to Current & Ongoing Projects for additional information. 9 We believe this survey and recovery capability combined with our proprietary research will allow us to conduct approximately two deep-water surveys per yearly weather window, should we have sufficient capital to undertake such operational surveys. Description of Key Equipment In 2011, Endurance LLC began purchasing key equipment for operations. Our equipment purchases have included a 100-foot survey vessel, tethered side-scan sonar units, and light work-class and inspection Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), Shackleton 1 and Squirt. Survey Ship Our 100-foot survey ship has been recently refurbished to include a sonar winch and the latest in electronics and side-scan sonar survey equipment. Depending on the timeframe, circumstances and our other commitments, we may use this ship or charter another vessel of similar or greater capability. Sidescan Sonar Side-scan sonar is currently the industry-standard search methodology used for oceanic search operations. An unmanned side-scan sonar unit, or towfish, is towed behind a manned surface vessel at a pre-set altitude above the seafloor. The sonar unit sends out a ping or sound-wave to acoustically map terrain, natural obstructions and man-made objects, including shipwrecks and jettison cargo. To engage in search operations, we have purchased side-scan sonar systems. Our dual-frequency systems may be set for a range of velocities, search widths and resolutions for both area mapping and high-resolution target prosecution up to 2,000 meters in depth. Our system is compatible with third-party hardware and software systems and meets IHO & NOAA survey specifications. Beyond shipwreck surveys, the system is also capable of cable and pipeline surveys, channel conditioning, geophysical surveys, mine countermeasures and search and recovery operations. Our sonar systems are a flexible platform from both a hardware and software standpoint, and may continue to be upgraded with industry-standard, off-the-shelf sensor packages. Potential shipwreck targets found by sonar will be catalogued, evaluated and eventually visually prosecuted using the Shackleton 1 or Squirt ROV systems, or other systems chartered or rented for inspection and recovery missions. ROV Shackleton 1 The Remotely-Operated Vehicle (ROV) system Shackleton 1 is a light work-class ROV. This system is comprised of underwater lighting, still and motion picture cameras and a single robotic manipulator arm. Initially designed for mid-water industrial applications, the ROV has been redesigned for shipwreck search, identification and cargo recovery operations. Beyond shipwreck operations, the system is also capable of cable and pipeline inspection and repair, geophysical sampling and search and recovery operations. ROV system Shackleton 1 is currently in disassembled condition for storage following a scheduled overhaul and will be reassembled prior to any operational requirements. 10 Employees The Company has five corporate officers. Each officer is also an officer of other entities and not full time employees of the Company. Other Employees and Contractors We utilize contract personnel for vessel operation during our survey periods, and intend to continue to use contract technicians to perform marine survey and recovery operations in the future. From time to time, we have or intend to hire other contractors, subcontractors and consultants to perform specific services. Project Operations Research During the Colonial period (1500-1850), the world economy was highly dependent on the physical transportation of bullion coinage, precious metals and high-value non-ferrous metals. A small percentage of shipping during this period was lost to storm, fire, acts of war, natural disasters and other causes, both known and unknown. The administration of this economic system required state-level bureaucratic oversight and record-keeping. Many of these historic records are available in publications, libraries, archives and digitized formats in depositories across the world. Though many records have been lost to time, enough remain to create in-depth, credible project profiles for potential excavation targets. To that end, we have created a series of regional and period-specific databases from which to compare, evaluate and select potential targets for research, discovery and eventual excavation and recovery. The graphics below are a visual representation of selected world regions containing our High Interest database of shipwrecks and their approximate location and time of sinking. 11 12 Before search or recovery operations may begin, we seek to understand every factor necessary to mount a recovery operation with a high probability of success. These factors include, but are not limited to: The historical context of the shipwreck, including political forces, technological developments, important contextual persons and events and the public reaction to the loss. Any images of the shipwreck, including still photography, motion pictures, drawing, paintings, recreations and/or models. A complete sinking timeline, including as much information as possible on weather patterns, departure date/time, intended course, course corrections, witness/observer statements. This includes any statement, fact or event material in any way to the sinking. A proposed search area with a high-probability of success, including an evaluation of all factors listed in the Sinking Timeline as well as any territorial boundaries or environmental factors. An Identification Guide, enabling rapid qualification or rejection of potential targets based on sonar and visual imagery, thus limiting expensive ship time on station. Cargo evaluation, evaluating the historical records on the targets cargo and potential modern-day value. Any encumbering factors, including territorial ownership of waters, insurance claims, potential cargo claims and sovereign rights. We will not begin a project without a legal path to possession. All of the above information is gleaned from publications, libraries, archives and digitized medium. Development of further projects is a continuous, ongoing process. 13 Search Most operational projects begin with a sonar search phase. We have outfitted our vessel with state-of-the-art sonar systems, an industry standard for underwater search operations. Our vessel tows the sonar systems to map the seafloor and search for targets. Potential targets are then selected from the sonar imagery using a combination of computerized post-processing and expert evaluation. While some shipwreck targets may be positively identified using high-resolution sonar system, others may need visual identification using an underwater camera ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) system or an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). Recovery Once a target is positively identified, excavation and recovery operations will begin using our Shackleton 1 light-work class ROV system, or other chartered ROV systems. Shackleton 1 will document the site using sonar, still and motion-picture imagery. It will then be used for any necessary excavation, as well as coinage, bullion and/or other recovery operations. Post-Recovery Conservation Coinage, precious metals and non-ferrous metals typically require a minimum amount of post-recovery conservation. In order to preserve the value of the recovered cargo, we will have an on-site facility capable of properly storing and transporting all recovered coinage, precious metals and non-ferrous metals to definitive and final conservation and storage prior to sale. Sales We intend to recover coinage and bullion precious metals, including but not limited to gold and silver. We believe that bullion metals, numismatically-graded coinage and non-graded coinage have significant value in the collector market. We intend to sell the existing independent coin dealers as well as directly to the collector and consumer market through the internet. Current & Ongoing Projects Project Connaught Research Summary The Connaught was a steam-powered packet ship, part of a fast and indispensable transatlantic communication link, the perfect vessel to rapidly ferry mails and passengers between Britain and the United States. Large for her time, she was a side-wheel steamer constructed almost entirely of iron. On her last voyage, the Connaught left Great Britain, bound for the United States. She carried several dozen first-class passengers, more than four hundred steerage passengers and a full crew of nearly 130. The Connaught also disembarked with a cargo of gold coins, and the Captain assumed an uneventful voyage. According to reports, when heavy seas set in, the Connaught began to roll heavily. Though the initial problem was temporarily fixed, twelve hours later the same roll started again. Making matters worse, fire broke out. Buckets and pumps were manned, but the water rose rapidly and extinguished the furnaces, rendering the ship immobile. The fire quickly spread, driving the passengers above decks. The purser and two men attempted to rescue the gold shipment, but were driven back by the smoke and flames. A nearby ship came to the rescue, bravely maneuvering close to the Connaught and running a line between the two to facilitate transfer of passenger. Per age-old protocol, the Captain was the last man off the ship. 14 Virtually nothing was saved. Nearly every trunk and stitch of clothing was lost, including all the money of the first-class passengers. Early the next morning, a passing ship fell in with the Connaught, shadowing the stricken vessel through her final hours. The burning Connaught exploded and sank by the stern, leaving only an overturned lifeboat, light portions of the decking and a few trunks. The passing ship spent an hour recovering debris, dutifully recorded the sinking position, and then sailed on to New York. Historic image of Paddle Steamship Connaught Source: National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, U.K. Project Connaught  Current Status In October of 2014 we positively identified the location of the Connaught through sonar imagery and video footage. In July 2015, we were granted exclusive salvage rights by the US Federal Courts, and we returned to the site of the Connaught to begin salvage efforts, and retrieved the first artifacts from the debris field. Our salvage operations have been temporarily hampered by the discovery of a mass of man-made debris and large commercial fishing nets concentrated around the aft section of the wreck. We have determined the appropriate equipment and methodology to clear these obstacles, and intend to return to the wreck site with these tools as soon as practical. Given the task list and the short weather window that we can work in the North Atlantic, we intend to resume our salvage operations in summer of 2016. The cost of recovering the cargo of the Connaught is estimated to be $1,200,000 - $1,500,000. The Company needs additional working capital to recover the cargo of the Connaught . There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position to recover the cargo of the Connaught . 15 High-resolution sonar image of the steamship Connaught Source: Endurance Exploration Group, Inc.

This trade was based on the exchange of precious metals for goods, and silver was the only European payment acceptable to Asian trading partners. The Black Marlin was one such vessel engaged in this trade. She was an English East Indiaman, more than 700 tons, three decks high and armed with many cannon. In addition to the silver coin expected by Asian merchants, she also carried lace, golden fabric, beaver fur, tobacco, wine, cloth and iron nails. The shipping routes of the time took the English ship to the Indian Ocean for resupply in the middle of her long voyage to the East. According to reports, unknown to her Captain and crew, nearby European enemy ships were hunting for English shipping. They discovered the Black Marlin was in the area and sailed to intercept. The European enemy ships approached the English ship under a false flag and prepared to attack. The trap set and ready to attack, the Europeans demanded the surrender of the English vessel. Instead of surrendering, the English captain counterattacked, and the vessels began to exchange heavy cannon fire, beginning a pitched fight that would continue over many hours. In a last-ditch effort to escape, the English ship unfurled her sails and attempted to sail away. The Europeans quickly caught up and soon the English ship was disabled and unable to continue fighting. Rather than surrender, the Captain of the English ship set his own vessel on fire, escaping in a small boat with a chosen group of men while allowing his own ship and abandoned sailors to burn. The fire reached the gunpowder storage, and the English ship burned vigorously and sank, taking with her a rich cargo of silver. We believe this shipwreck lies at a depth of between 500-3000 meters of water. Woodcut graphic depicting the sinking of Black Marlin Source: “ A Sea Fight in 1690. (1893) Tuapeka Times, Rōrahi XXV. ” 18 Project “ Black Marlin ” – Current Status In November 2013, Endurance LLC entered into a contract with the sovereign government of an island nation in the Indian Ocean. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for the location and recover the Black Marlin and her silver cargo. We are currently pursuing an option to extend the existing contract. Net proceeds of our recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split between us (75%) and the island government (25%). The Company needs additional working capital to undertake the search for the Black Marlin. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position to search for, or recover the Black Marlin. By selecting Black Marlin as our second project and since the Black Marlin was reported to have been lost within 12 nautical miles of land, it was necessary, in the ordinary course of our business, to seek permission of the coastal state to work in their territorial waters. We are not under any obligation to undertake this project and if, at any time, events in the area or our continuing research revealed a lost shipwreck that is a more logical choice to undertake as our second project, we will make that change in project priorities. Project Black Marlin  Targets of Opportunity Wahoo and Dolphin As part of discussions pertaining to project Black Marlin,  we have learned of two shallow-water targets of opportunity within the same territorial waters as the Black Marlin. Believed to be English East Indiaman, these wrecks (code-named Dolphin and Wahoo) remain unidentified at this time. Until these wrecks are identified, it will not be possible to generate any estimate on the potential value, if any. We expect to begin operations on these wrecks in conjunction with the Black Marlin in 2016. Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concession Currently, we neither own nor rely on any patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises. We have been granted a concession for shipwreck search and recovery in the territorial waters of an East African island nation by the government of that nation. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for and recover the Black Marlin and her silver cargo. Net proceeds of our recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split between us (75%) and the island government (25%). Competition There are a number of competing entities engaged in aquatic research, survey, inspection and the various aspects of the shipwreck salvage business. One or more of these competing entities may locate and recover a shipwreck that we intend to locate and recover. In addition, these competing entities may be better capitalized and may have greater resources to devote to their pursuit of shipwreck salvage. Governmental and Environmental Regulation We are subject to local, state and national taxation. Additionally, our operations are subject to a variety of national, federal, state, local and international laws. In particular, the legal, political, or civil initiatives of countries, international governing bodies and/or other maritime jurisdictions may restrict our operations and prevent or cause us to suspend or abort particular searches or salvage operations. 19 Project Black Marlin  Government or environmental regulations that may restrict our operations. The island nation has signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (the LOS). In this capacity and in keeping with the provisions of the LOS, the island nation asserts jurisdiction over its territorial waters, defined by the LOS as 12 nautical miles, 22.2 kilometers or 13.1 miles from the low water mark of the coastal state. Based upon our historical research, we believe the Black Marlin sank within the territorial waters of the island nation. While the island nation is not a signatory to nor has it ratified the International Convention on Salvage (ICS), the Company and its contractors operate in accordance the provisions of the ICS. Those provisions state generally, that in undertaking salvage a salvage company shall exercise due care in order to minimizing damage to the environment. Damage to the environment is defined by the Treaty under Article 1 (d) as follows: Damage to the environment means substantial physical damage to human health or to marine life or resources in coastal or inland waters or areas adjacent thereto, caused by pollution, contamination, fire, explosion or similar major incidents. The Company and its contractors take into account complying with the ISC when estimating costs for the Black Marlin cargo recovery operations. The island country has no written laws or regulations with respect to salvage operations in general and has placed no additional restrictions on the operations of the Company when it begins operations to locate and recover the Black Marlins cargo. Project Connaught  Government or environmental regulations that may restrict our operations. We believe that the target site identified as Connaught is the wreck of the Connaught a paddlewheel steamer that sank in October 1860. That shipwreck is located approximately 125 miles off the coast of the United States of America (U.S.). While the U.S. has not ratified the LOS, this location is recognized under U.S. law as being in international waters. The Company has elected to submit itself to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Courts by filing a case in admiralty on October 3, 2014 in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida. The process of adjudicating ownership and claims, including the Companys request for a salvage claim or, in the alternative, title to the ship and its cargo, will proceed in the U.S. Court pursuant to U.S. admiralty law. The right to salvage a privately own vessel is not subject to approval of the U.S. Courts or any government agency. Once a party has submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Courts, the Court can determine the ownership rights to the cargo salvaged and the amount of a salvage award according to precedent cases ruled upon by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Company makes its claims based upon those legal precedents. The United States Coast Guard undertakes marine environmental protection in U.S. waters pursuant to Volume IX of its Marine Environmental Protection  Marine Safety Manual  COMDTINST M16000.14. As specified in Chapter 1 on page 16, the U.S. Coast Guard also looks to the International Convention on Salvage for guidance on salvage operations even though the U.S. has not ratified that treaty. The Company and its contractors expect to conduct salvage operations within the guidelines of the ICS. The Company and its contractors take into account complying with the ISC when estimating costs for the Connaught cargo recovery operations. 20 THE OFFERING Securities being offered Up to 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock underlying warrants. Our Common Stock is described in further detail in the section of this prospectus titled DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES. Offering Type The Offering is being conducted on a best efforts basis, there is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the Offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. Per Share Price $0.25 No Revocation Once you submit a Subscription Agreement and the Company accepts it, you may not revoke or change your subscription or request a refund of monies paid. All accepted subscriptions are irrevocable, even if you subsequently learn information about us that you consider to be materially unfavorable. Duration of Offering The Offering shall continue until all shares offered hereunder have been sold or until the expiration of a 180 day period from the date of effectiveness of this Registration Statement, unless such period is extended by our Board of Directors. Number of Shares Outstanding Before the Offering As of the date of this Registration Statement there are 43,024,369 shares of Common Stock, and 0 shares of Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding. Upon the completion of the Offering under this Registration Statement, there will be 54,024,369 shares of Common Stock outstanding provided all of the shares offered hereby are sold and all the shares underlying warrants are issued. Ticker Symbol EXPL  Listed on the OTCQB Net Proceeds to the Company The Company is offering 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value and at an offering price of $0.25 per Share for maximum net proceeds to the Company of $2,207,915. The full subscription price will be payable at the time of subscription and any such funds received from subscribers in this Offering will be released to the Company when subscriptions are received and accepted. Substantial expenditures will be required to enable the Company to scale up its operations and quality of services. While the Company believes that if all shares offered hereunder are sold, the net proceeds should be sufficient to permit the Company to continue operations and meet its capital requirements for approximately twelve (12) months, it is anticipated that the Company may need to raise additional capital to maintain operations, facilitate future growth and support its long-term growth initiatives. In addition, if not all of the Shares offered hereunder are sold, the Company will need to obtain substantial additional funds much sooner, and possibly within twelve (12) months after this Offering to grow and expand its operations. Therefore, it is likely that the Company would need to seek additional financing through subsequent future private sales of its debt or equity securities to fund its growth plans. There can be no assurance, however, that such efforts can generate availability of additional funds when needed, or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Any such additional financing may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to curtail its expansion plans, which will adversely affect its revenue and profitability. Use of Proceeds If all of the shares of Common Stock offered hereunder are sold, the net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the shares will be approximately $2,207,915. The offering proceeds will be utilized mainly for expenditures relating to our shipwreck search and salvage operations. 21 FINANCIAL SUMMARY In the tables below, we provide you with our summary financial data for the periods indicated.

We have only just begun operations, and thus have no way to evaluate the likelihood that we will be successful in our efforts to locate and monetize lost shipwrecks. You should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by similar companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The search for shipwrecks as a business is inherently risky. We may not find any commercially exploitable shipwrecks. In such a case, we may be unable to continue operations, and you could lose your entire investment. We have a limited operating history with a history of losses and expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future. We have yet to establish any history of profitable operations. We have not generated any revenues since January 19, 2006 (inception) and do not anticipate that we will generate revenues which will be sufficient to sustain our operations in the near future. Unless and until we are able to generate revenues we will continue to sustain losses. There is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring losses from operations and insufficient cash resources to meet our business objectives, all of which means that we may not be able to continue operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, reflect net losses of $973,512 and $684,114 respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In light of the acquisition of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC on December 31, 2013, and since both entities were under common control, the comparative financial statements are presented as if the previously separated entities were combined. We are currently evaluating acquisitions and other business opportunities. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to recover and monetize valuable shipwreck cargoes and to secure investment capital from future funding opportunities. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in these efforts. Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. As changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategy to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. In any of these events our costs may increase, and we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets. We will continue to experience losses from both pre-operational expenditures as well as planned operations. We have experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since our inception. Even if we do generate operating income in the future, subsequent developments in our industry, customer base, business or cost structure, or an event such as litigation may cause us to experience operating losses. We may not become profitable in the future. 24 We are subject to macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control as well as the business, financial, operating and other risks of start-up companies, all of which may adversely affect our financial results and growth. Macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control as well as the business, financial, operating and other risks of a shell company can adversely affect us. These factors include: changes and volatility in general economic conditions, including the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. and financial markets; war, civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events; outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases; climate change and resource scarcity, such as water and energy scarcity; natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, hurricanes, floods, oil spills and nuclear incidents; low consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment and depressed housing prices; domestic and international political and geo-political conditions; changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs; the costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with applicable laws and regulations; changes in operating costs, including, but not limited to, energy, benefits, insurance and unanticipated costs resulting from force majeure events; and the lack of availability, or increase in the cost, of capital for us. We may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses or through business alliances. These acquisitions and investment activities may be unsuccessful or divert our managements attention. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other businesses or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing businesses. In many cases, we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Acquisitions or investments in businesses, or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to: issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders; spending cash and incurring debt; assuming contingent liabilities; and creating additional expenses. 25 We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all, or that the ability to obtain financing will not be restricted by the terms of a revolving credit facility or other indebtedness we may incur. The success of any such acquisitions or investments will also depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations. We may experience difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, or other assets, including difficulties relating to: coordinating sales, distribution and marketing functions; integrating technology information systems; and preserving the important licensing, distribution, marketing, customer, labor and other relationships of the acquired assets. In addition, any such acquisitions, investments, or alliances could demand significant attention from our management that would otherwise be available for our regular business operations, which could harm our business. We may be unsuccessful in raising the necessary capital to fund operations and capital expenditures. Our ability to generate cash flow is dependent upon our ability to find, excavate and monetize the cargo of shipwrecks. We cannot guarantee that the sales of the recovered cargo and/or related products and other available cash sources will generate sufficient cash flow to meet our overall cash requirements. If cash flow is not sufficient to meet our business requirements, we will be required to raise additional capital through other financing activities. Success in raising necessary funds is not guaranteed. We depend on key personnel and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified personnel. Key management and operational personnel may be difficult to replace. We do not have any employment or noncompetition agreements with our key personnel. We may not be able to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future, which could affect our business. Our background research and data-gathering may prove unreliable. The success of any marine salvage project is highly dependent on background research and data. Background research and data-gathering may prove to be imprecise, misleading, incomplete and/or unreliable. This data and research is further affected by the interpretation process due to factors such as analyst misinterpretations, erroneous calculations, and/or translation errors. Operations may be hindered by natural hazards and weather patterns. Marine salvage operations are inherently technologically challenging and may be delayed, suspended or aborted due to weather, sea conditions or other natural hazards. Operations may be dependent on both predictable and unpredictable seasonal weather cycles. We may not be able to logistically begin, continue or complete operations during favorable weather conditions. Both predictable and unpredictable weather events, including but not limited to storms, cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons and tsunamis, may delay, suspend or cause us to abort particular salvage operations. We may discover a commercially exploitable shipwreck cargo but be unable to successfully recover the cargo. If our search program is successful in discovering a commercially exploitable cargo, we may require additional funds in order to advance operations into commercial recovery. In such an event, we may be unable to obtain the funds, equipment and/or personnel in order to continue operations, and we may be unable to generate revenues. 26 We may be unable to establish or maintain rights to recovered objects. Persons and entities other than us may claim title to the shipwrecks and/or valuable cargo that we may recover. Even if we are successful in locating and recovering shipwrecks and/or valuable cargo, we cannot assure we will be able to establish our rights to property recovered if challenged by governmental entities, prior owners, or other attempted salvors claiming an interest therein. In such an event we could spend a great deal of time and money on a shipwreck project, and receive no salvage claim or revenue for our work. Our shipwrecks may be in controlled water where the policies and laws of a certain government may change abruptly, thereby impacting our ability to operate in those zones. The profitability of our operations is directly related to the market price of metals and the numismatic coin market. The market prices of metals and the numismatic coin market fluctuate significantly and are affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the rate of inflation, the exchange rate of the dollar to other currencies, interest rates, global economic and political conditions, and the collectors market. Price fluctuations in the metals and numismatic market from the conception of a potential target to the conclusion of operations can significantly affect profitability. We may begin one or more operations at a time when the price of metals or numismatic coins make operations economically feasible and subsequently incur losses due to market decreases. Adverse fluctuations in the metals or numismatic market may force us to curtail or cease our business operations. We face significant competition from better-established competitors We compete with other interests possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than we do in connection with the discovery and excavation of shipwrecks. Risks Related To Ownership of Our Stock and this Offering The market price of our common stock can be volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when you may want to sell your holdings. The market price of our shares is volatile. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. These factors include: our earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors; changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock; speculation about our business in the press or the investment community; significant developments relating to our relationships with our customers or suppliers; stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publically traded companies and, in particular, those that are in our industry; customer demand for our products; investor perceptions of our industry in general and us in particular; the operating and stock performance of comparable companies; general economic conditions and trends; announcements by us or our competitors of new products, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles; loss of external funding sources; sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or significant shareholders; and additions or departures of key personnel. Securities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. Should this type of litigation be instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs to us and divert our managements attention and resources. Moreover, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock at a time when you want to sell your stock. 27 We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on shares of our common stock and we are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. Should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions. We are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. As our common stock is a penny stock, it is subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, the so called Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by the Penny Stock Rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock. Our common stock is illiquid and subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations. If a liquid market for our common stock does develop, its market price could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting us or our competitors. In addition, the stock market itself is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock. A large number of shares may be eligible for future sale and may depress our stock price. We may be required, under terms of future financing arrangements, to offer a large number of common shares to the public, or to register for sale by future private investors a large number of shares sold in private sales to them. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or a perception that such sales could occur, and the existence of options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock at prices that may be below the then-current market price of our common stock, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities, either of which would decrease the value of any earlier investment in our common stock. 28 Micah Eldred and Carl Dilley own a significant majority of our voting shares and their interests may differ from those of our other shareholders. As of March 31, 2016, Micah Eldred and Carl Dilley, and affiliated entities, own approximately 45.08% and 23.87% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, respectively (see Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management ), and they will have significant influence over the outcome of matters that require shareholder approval, including election of directors and, accordingly, over our business and corporate matters. They may exercise their voting rights in ways that they believe is in their best interests, which may conflict with the interest of our other shareholders. We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering, including for any of the purposes described in the section of this prospectus entitled Use of Proceeds . The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:  variations in our revenues and operating expenses;  actual or anticipated changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;  market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole;  actual or expected changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates;  developments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;  announcements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;  announcements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;  sales of our common stock or other securities by us or in the open market; and  changes in the market valuations of other comparable companies. In addition, if the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or operating results. The trading price of our shares of common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry, even if these events do not directly affect us. Each of these factors, among others, could harm the value of your investment. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of managements attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 29 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the sections entitled Summary, Risk Factors, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Business. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors described in the section captioned Risk Factors above. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipates, believes, could, estimates, expects, intends, may, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, would and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this prospectus. You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in this prospectus, or that we filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. 30 DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of our common shares was arbitrarily determined by our management after consultation with the placement agent and was based upon consideration of various factors including our history and prospects, the background of our management and current conditions in the securities markets. The price of our common shares does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, net worth or other economic or recognized criteria of value. In no event should the offering price of our common shares be regarded as an indicator of any future market price of our securities. USE OF PROCEEDS Assuming we raise 100% of the maximum offering amount from this offering, we estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of stock offered by us will be approximately $2,200,000, based on the public offering price of $0.25 per share, and after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and obtain the working capital necessary to implement our business plan. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds of this offering. However, we currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, vessel and equipment rental and charters, recovery and survey activities, capital expenditures, employee and contractor compensation, reduction in accounts payables and debt, and other corporate purposes. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. Given that there is no minimum offering size, it is possible that we will receive significantly less proceeds than the expected proceeds of $2,200,000. The following is a table that shows the use of proceeds based on the amount of funds we expect to receive on a sliding scale as a percentage of the total offering amount. If 25% of Shares Sold If 50% of Shares Sold If 75% of Shares Sold If 100% of Shares Sold Gross Proceeds $ 625,000 $ 1,250,000 $ 1,875,000 $ 2,500,000 Placement Agent Fees 62,500 125,000 187,500 250,000 Offering Expense 42,085 42,085 42,085 42,085 General Corporate Purposes $ 520,415 $ 1,082,915 $ 1,090,830 $ 2,207,915 DIVIDEND POLICY We intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. Should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions. 31 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our capitalization as of December 31, 2015 (audited). You should read this table in conjunction with Use of Proceeds, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

These prices reflect inter-dealer prices without retail mark-up, mark-down, or commission, and may not necessarily reflect actual transactions. The following table sets forth the high and low bid prices for the common stock as reported for each quarterly period from the last two years. High and Low Bid Prices on Our Common Stock Year Quarter Ended High Low 2016 March 31 $0.445 $0.20 2015 December 31 $0.60 $0.15 2015 September 30 $1.00 $0.41 2015 June 30 $1.00 $0.21 2015 March 31 $0.57 $0.10 2014 December 31 $0.60 $0.10 2014 September 30 $0.6099 $0.25 2014 June 30 $1.10 $0.41 As of March 31, 2016 there were 413 active shareholders of record. The Board of Directors believes that the number of beneficial owners is greater than the number of record holders because a portion of our outstanding common stock is held in broker street names for the benefit of individual investors. 32 Warrants and Options As of March 31, 2016, we had issued non-qualified options to a number of our officers, directors, and employees to purchase 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at any time prior to December 31, 2017, with an exercise price of $0.25 per share, and placement agent warrants to purchase 574,000 shares of our common stock at any time prior to December 22, 2025, with an exercise price of $0.25 per share.

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans The following table summarizes the equity compensation plans under which our equity securities could be issued as of March 31, 2016: Number of Securities to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights Weighted Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column) Equity compensation plans approved by shareholders 0 0 0 Equity compensation plans not approved by shareholders (1) 5,000,000 $ 0.25 2,000,000 Totals 5,000,000 $ 0.25 2,000,000 (1) Includes shares of our common stock authorized for awards under the 2014 Non-qualified Stock Option Plan. Our Board of Directors adopted the 2014 Non-qualified Stock Option Plan on December 31, 2013. The Plan will terminate on December 31, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the Board. Under the Plan, 7 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance to non-employee directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors. The terms of each option award will be determined by the Board, or a duly appointed board committee, provided that no employee may receive options to purchase more than 5 million shares under the Plan, the exercise price must be at least equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock (as defined in the Plan) on the date of grant, and no option may be exercisable more than 10 years after the date of grant. Shares awarded under the Plan may be from authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. 33 DILUTION If you invest in our common shares, your investment will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share you will pay in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of our common shares immediately after this offering. Investors participating in this offering will incur immediate, substantial dilution. Our net tangible book value as of December 31, 2015 was $0.008, per common share (audited), based on 43,024,369 common shares outstanding. Investors will incur further dilution from (i) assuming the sale by us of 10,000,000 common shares offered in this offering at an assumed public offering price of $0.25 per Common share, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, our as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31, 2015 would have been $0.048, per Common share. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $0.040 per Common share to our existing shareholders and an immediate dilution of $0.202 per Common share to the new investors purchasing our common shares in this offering. The following table illustrates this per share dilution: Public offering price per Common share $ 0.25 Net tangible book value per Common share as of December 31, 2015 $ 0.008 Net tangible book value per Common share after this offering $ 0.048 Dilution per Common share to new public investors $ 0.202 The discussion and tables above are based on (i) 43,024,369 common shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and (ii) 10,000,000 common shares issued in the public offering. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our shareholders. 34 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The results presented in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations are those of Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries as reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements included herein.

Plan of Operation Side-scan sonar survey operations on Project Connaught began in July of 2013. Over the course of this initial survey, approximately 700 square miles were digitally mapped. This sonar imagery was then post-processed and evaluated for potential targets. In October of 2014 we positively identified the target of Project Sailfish, as that of the Steamship Connaught via video and sonar imagery. We intend to return to the site of the Connaught in 2016 to begin recovering its cargo. The cost of recovering the cargo of the Connaught is estimated to be $1,200,000. The Company needs additional working capital to recover the cargo of the Connaught . There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position to recover the cargo of the Connaught . In November 2013, Endurance LLC entered into a contract with the sovereign government of an island nation in the Indian Ocean. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for and recover the Black Marlin and her silver cargo. We are currently pursuing an option to extend the existing contract. Net proceeds of our recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split between us (75%) and the island government (25%). The cost of finding and recovering the cargo of the Black Marlin is estimated to be $2,000,000. The Company needs additional working capital to undertake the search for the Black Marlin . There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position to search for and recover the cargo of the Black Marlin . 35 Results of Operations The following information represents our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Revenue Since inception through December 31, 2015, we have not generated any revenues. However, during this period of time, the Company has acquired a ship, side scan sonar, topside computer processing of sonar images and a remotely operated vehicle with cameras that can visually inspect things located by the side scan sonar. We have surveyed, using sidescan sonar, over 700 square miles in the North Atlantic. We have positively identified the Steamship Connaught , and have been appointed as salvor-in-possession by the U.S. Federal Court. While we intend to recover and monetize the cargo of the Connaught , there can be no assurance we will be successful in our efforts. We do not expect to generate any revenues until we recover the Connaughts cargo, or the cargo of other shipwrecks. Even if we are successful in recovering shipwreck cargoes, we would expect any future revenues to be highly inconsistent and unreliable in future periods. Expenses We incurred operations and research expenses of $698,849 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $287,468 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $411,381. The primary reason for this increase is a result of the increased spending on salvage operations undertaken in 2015 on the Connaught project. We incurred marketing and promotion expenses of $52,737 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $57,943 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $5,206. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in both advertising and travel expenses. We incurred $81,377 in stock based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $73,150 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $8,227. The primary reason for the increase is the increase in stock based compensation issued to the salvage contractors. We incurred general and administrative expenses of $184,539 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $242,715 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $58,176. The general and administrative costs consist primarily of legal and professional fees. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 consists of cancellation of debt income in the amount of $63,144. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $0. Net Losses For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $973,512 as compared to $684,114 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Current Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have funded our operations through the sale of equity securities and advances made to us by our officers and directors and their affiliated entities. As of December 31, 2015, we had $825 in cash. 36 Net cash used by operating activities was $664,113 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used by investing activities was $54,944 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities was $718,832 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This amount includes $604,832 net of issuance costs, raised from the sale of stock and funds advanced from related parties to facilitate operations for the period. Other Recent Financings On April 7, 2014, we entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement with Endeavour Cooperative Partners, LLC (Endeavour) relating to the conversion of indebtedness to Endeavour in the amount of $35,000. This amount represents the related party debt payable to Endeavour as of that date. The terms of the agreement allowed for Endeavour to convert this debt into common stock at $0.25 per share. Endeavour converted all of such debt into shares, as a result of which we issued 140,000 shares to Endeavour. On April 7, 2014, we entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement with Island Capital Management, LLC (Island), a company owned and controlled by Endeavour, relating to the conversion of indebtedness to Island in the amount of $70,000. This amount represents the related party debt payable to Island as of that date. The terms of the agreement allowed for Island to convert this debt into common stock at $0.25 per share. Island converted all of such debt into shares, as a result of which we issued 280,000 shares to Island. On June 24, 2014, we entered into a contract with Eclipse Group Inc. (Eclipse) for Eclipse to provide personnel and services to us in connection with the operation and monitoring of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in connection with our investigation of a suspected shipwreck located off the coast of New England. Steven Saint Amour, who serves as a member of our Board of Directors, and Joan Saint Amour are the principal shareholders and officers of Eclipse. The contract provides that Eclipse will provide 2 people, including Mr. Saint Amour, for approximately four 12-hour days to operate and monitor the ROV, which will be provided by us. We issued 100,000 shares of common stock to Eclipse Group Inc., with an agreed value of $25,000, under the contract, and reimbursed Eclipse in cash for its cost for the second ROV technician. On May 15, 2015, we entered into a contract with Eclipse Group Inc. (Eclipse) for Eclipse to provide personnel and services to us in connection with the operation and monitoring of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in connection with our investigation of a shipwreck located off the coast of New England. Steven Saint Amour, who serves as a member of our Board of Directors, and Joan Saint Amour are the principal shareholders and officers of Eclipse. The contract provides that Eclipse will provide equipment and personnel. We issued 2,000,000 shares of common stock to Eclipse Group Inc., with an agreed value of $500,000, under the contract, as prepayment for these services. Eclipse will invoice against this prepayment as services are rendered. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , Micah Eldred on the one hand and Carl Dilley and Heather Dilley on the other, made advances to the Company in the aggregate amounts of $281,500 in order to provide the Company with funds to carry on its operations. These advances do not bear interest, are unsecured and have no specific terms of repayment. As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate amount of such advances outstanding was $281,500. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Endeavour Cooperative Partners, LLC made net advances to the Company in the aggregate amount of $67,500, and Micah Eldred made net advances to the Company in the aggregate amount of $25,000 in order to provide the Company with funds to carry on its operations. These advances do not bear interest, are unsecured and have no specific terms of repayment. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of such advances outstanding was $95,500. Interest has not been imputed on this balance as management has deemed it to be immaterial. From April 2015 until November 2015, we engaged in an offering of up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.25 per share to accredited investors pursuant to Rule 506(c) under Regulation D and Regulation S. The offering is now closed, and the Company has sold $750,500 of common stock. The net proceeds after cash issuance costs was $637,832. 37 During the year ended December 31, 2015, Endeavour Cooperative Partners, LLC made net advances to the Company in the aggregate amount of $67,500, and Micah Eldred made net advances to the Company in the aggregate amount of $25,000 in order to provide the Company with funds to carry on its operations. These advances do not bear interest, are unsecured and have no specific terms of repayment. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of such advances outstanding was $95,500. Interest has not been imputed on this balance as management has deemed it to be immaterial Future Capital Requirements Our current available cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Our capital requirements for 2016 will depend on numerous factors, including managements evaluation of the timing of projects to pursue. Subject to our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital (including through possible joint ventures and/or partnerships), we expect to incur substantial expenditures to carry out our business plan, as well as costs associated with our capital raising efforts and being a public company. Our plans to finance our operations include seeking equity and debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements, or other business transactions, that would generate sufficient resources to ensure continuation of our operations. . The sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all of our planned activities and limit our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Research and Development For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred expenses for research consultants and travel of $14,758 and $12,804. Inflation The amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments. 38 Critical Accounting Estimates  Stock Based Compensation We applied the provisions of FASB ASC 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation, to account for our stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. We measure the fair value of each stock option grant at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2015 was $.10. We used the following Black-Scholes assumptions in arriving at the fair value of options granted on December 22, 2015: Expected Life In Years 5.5 Risk-free Interest Rates .990% Volatility 133.77% Dividend Yield 0% Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2015, we had no off balance sheet transactions that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 39 CORPORATE HISTORY AND STRUCTURE Our Corporate History and Background We were incorporated as Tecton Corporation, a Nevada corporation, on January 19, 2006, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hemis Corporation. On December 1, 2006, Hemis declared a dividend of Tecton shares to all shareholders as of that date and concurrently cancelled its share ownership Tecton. The effect of this dividend declaration and share cancellation was that Tecton was spun off as an independent company. On January 2, 2014, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. As used in this report, the terms we, us, our, Endurance and the Company mean Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation), unless otherwise indicated. Prior to June 2008, we were engaged in the exploration and acquisition of uranium properties that were either past producers or had been the subject of prior work programs and/or contained historic resources. On or about June 1, 2008, we ceased/discontinued operations of our uranium exploration activities; and had incurred to that point a net operating loss of approximately $5,600,000 since inception as we have sought to restructure and find a suitable business opportunity. We were deemed a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, from the discontinuance of operations in 2008 until the filing of our Form 8-K on December 31, 2013, relating to the acquisition of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC, on that date. During our restructuring period from June 2008 until December 31, 2013, we: Elected a new slate of directors and appointed a new management team focused on finding a suitable business opportunity for us; Attempted to reorganize our balance sheet through the US Bankruptcy courts by filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, but later withdrew our petition at the request of the court; Brought current our filings with the State of Nevada and our financial reporting and disclosure filings with the SEC; Effected a reverse 1 for 40 reverse split of our common stock; Amended and restated our Articles of Incorporation to increase the total authorized capital stock to 110,000,000 shares, being comprised of 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $.01 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $.001; Paid approximately $292,000 of outstanding debt through the issuance of 12,733,499 newly issued common shares on December 31, 2013; and Entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, on December 31, 2013, to acquire the ownership interests of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC. for 20,550,539 shares of common stock. Our fiscal year end was changed from January 31 to December 31 in November 2013. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB electronic quotation system under the symbol EXPL. Endurance Exploration Group, LLC On December 31, 2013, we completed the purchase of 100% of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (Endurance LLC), from its members in exchange for 20,550,539 shares of our common stock, valued at $0.0186 per share, based upon the net book value of the assets of Endurance LLC of $381,173 as of December 31, 2013. Micah Eldred, who serves as our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Carl Dilley who serves as one of our directors and our Vice President, were the owners of all of the interests in Endurance LLC. Messrs. Eldred and Dilley were also the beneficial owners of a majority of our common stock at the time. Endurance LLC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, and its operations are now our primary focus. 40 OUR BUSINESS Overview Endurance LLC was formed in 2009 to explore, from an operational and financial perspective, the feasibility and potential economic return of recovering historic and modern day shipwreck cargos. Based on the business started by Endurance LLC, we have developed a research methodology with three goals. The first goal is to establish a comprehensive understanding of the larger economic, technological and social trends that lead to the transport of physical wealth across oceans during different historical periods, along with creating a High Interest list of shipwrecks and their cargos lost across various historical periods. Conflict, accidents and acts of nature claimed a percentage of all voyages, and many of the shipwrecked vessels are believed to have carried a valuable cargo. The second objective is to identify, from this population of potential shipwreck losses, those shipwrecks that could be legally salvaged and recovered, and the cargos sold, with a positive return on the capital investment required for their location and recovery. The third goal is to move those projects which had the potential to generate positive investment returns into an operational phase with a high, risk-adjusted, chance of success; and, to develop a portfolio of projects in various stages of research, search, survey and recovery. To that end, we have evaluated historical shipwreck databases holding in excess of 125,000 entries as well as undertaken contextual and keyword library and archival searches. It is important to note that even these massive repositories of data reflect just a small percentage of the 3,000,000+ shipwrecks the United Nations estimates lay on the ocean floor. From these databases and other searches, we have developed an initial High Interest list of approximately 400 shipwrecks. Using criteria including (but not limited to) depth, potential search area, legal concerns, difficulty of excavation and potential value, we further culled the High Interest list to approximately two-dozen targets, the Target List. In order for a shipwreck to qualify for our Target List, and to potentially move forward as an Operational Target (OT) -one that we may consider for the search and survey operation phase- the shipwreck must possess the following criteria: Known Cargo of Value. Based upon the historical and archival records, an OT must contain a quantifiable cargo of value. While the historical records may not provide our researchers with an exact present day value of a potential cargo, we must be able to determine a quantifiable range of its estimated value based upon cargo manifests or other archival documents. Known Navigational Data . Our research must provide information that would allow us to establish a geographically definable search and sinking location and, subsequently, an economically feasible search area for any potential target. Legal Salvage and Clear Path to Title. Admiralty law, salvage law, and various sovereign nations laws and regulations concerning the search and salvage of historical and modern shipwrecks are complex. Prior to pursuing an OT, we must be able to establish a clear legal path to the title of any potential recovery, and search and recovery must be made in compliance with international laws and regulations or under specific country permissions. 41 Potential Returns Exceed Risk-Adjusted Cost of Search and Recovery. Prior to moving a shipwreck from our Target List to an Operational Target, we evaluate a large number of factors to determine the potential search and recovery costs, and the risks associated with such search and recovery. Items considered include: a targets location and likely depth, its location from the nearest operational port, the complexity and costs of potential search and salvage, legal issues to title, and many other factors; and, we develop an initial search plan and budget for each potential project. We recognize the high risk, yet potentially high rewards, of our business; and, we realize that we will not be successful finding or salvaging every project we undertake. Therefore, prior to moving any project onto the Operational Target list, we take a risk-adjusted approach to the potential returns that a project can provide; and we determine if, on a risk-adjusted basis, the potential target is economically feasible and appropriate to add to our portfolio of Operational Targets. Projects code-named Connaught has now reached operational status. For project Connaught we have now surveyed over 700 square miles in the Western Atlantic Ocean in search of a sunken passenger liner carrying a substantial cargo of gold coinage. In addition to this manifest cargo, we also expect to find additional valuables among the personal stores of the ships passengers. In October of 2014 we announced the discovery of the steamship Connaught , previously identified only as Project  Sailfish  . In July 2015, we were granted exclusive salvage rights by the US Federal Courts. Please refer to Current & Ongoing Projects for additional information. For pre-operational project  Black Marlin , in November 2013, Endurance LLC entered into a contract with the sovereign government of an island nation in the Indian Ocean. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for and recover the Black Marlin and her silver cargo. Net proceeds of our recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split between us (75%) and the island government (25%). This contract also allows for other potentially valuable targets of opportunity within the territorial waters of this nation. We are currently pursuing an option to extend the existing contract. Please refer to Current & Ongoing Projects for additional information. We believe this survey and recovery capability combined with our proprietary research will allow us to conduct approximately two deep-water surveys per yearly weather window, should we have sufficient capital to undertake such operational surveys. Description of Key Equipment In 2011, Endurance LLC began purchasing key equipment for operations. Our equipment purchases have included a 100-foot survey vessel, tethered side-scan sonar units, and light work-class and inspection Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), Shackleton 1 and Squirt. Survey Ship Our 100-foot survey ship has been recently refurbished to include a sonar winch and the latest in electronics and side-scan sonar survey equipment. Depending on the timeframe, circumstances and our other commitments, we may use this ship or charter another vessel of similar or greater capability. Sidescan Sonar Side-scan sonar is currently the industry-standard search methodology used for oceanic search operations. An unmanned side-scan sonar unit, or towfish, is towed behind a manned surface vessel at a pre-set altitude above the seafloor. The sonar unit sends out a ping or sound-wave to acoustically map terrain, natural obstructions and man-made objects, including shipwrecks and jettison cargo. 42 To engage in search operations, we have purchased side-scan sonar systems. Our dual-frequency systems may be set for a range of velocities, search widths and resolutions for both area mapping and high-resolution target prosecution up to 2,000 meters in depth. Our system is compatible with third-party hardware and software systems and meets IHO & NOAA survey specifications. Beyond shipwreck surveys, the system is also capable of cable and pipeline surveys, channel conditioning, geophysical surveys, mine countermeasures and search and recovery operations. Our sonar systems are a flexible platform from both a hardware and software standpoint, and may continue to be upgraded with industry-standard, off-the-shelf sensor packages. The sonar towfish of one of our current survey systems was lost during the final days of our 2013 search operations. For more information on project Connaught , please refer to Current & Ongoing Projects . We expect to purchase, charter or otherwise replace this sonar equipment and capability before beginning any future search operations. Potential shipwreck targets found by sonar will be catalogued, evaluated and eventually visually prosecuted using the Shackleton 1 or Squirt ROV systems, or other systems chartered or rented for inspection and recovery missions. ROV Shackleton 1 The Remotely-Operated Vehicle (ROV) system Shackleton 1 is a light work-class ROV. This system is comprised of underwater lighting, still and motion picture cameras and a single robotic manipulator arm. Initially designed for mid-water industrial applications, the ROV has been redesigned for shipwreck search, identification and cargo recovery operations. Beyond shipwreck operations, the system is also capable of cable and pipeline inspection and repair, geophysical sampling and search and recovery operations. ROV system Shackleton 1 is currently in disassembled condition for storage following a scheduled overhaul and will be reassembled prior to any operational requirements. Employees The Company has five corporate officers. Each officer is also an officer of other entities and not full time employees of the Company. A list of the Companys officers and the average number of hours per week each officer expects to devote to Company affairs are as follows: Micah Eldred, Director, President and CEO, 20 hours per week. Carl Dilley, Director and Vice President, 10 hours per week. Christine Zitman, Director, Secretary, Treasurer and CFO, 20 hours per week. Guy Zajonc, Director and Vice President, 20 hours per week. Keith Holloway, Vice President of Shareholder Communications, 30 hours per week. Other Employees and Contractors We utilize contract personnel for vessel operation during our survey periods, and intend to continue to use contract technicians to perform marine survey and recovery operations in the future. From time to time, we have or intend to hire other contractors, subcontractors and consultants to perform specific services. During 2014, two individuals who joined our Board of Directors in January 2014 were employed in various capacities by us as independent contractors. See Compensation Paid to Messrs. Zajonc and Saint Amour in 2014 and Employment Agreements below. 43 Project Operations Research During the Colonial period (1500-1850), the world economy was highly dependent on the physical transportation of bullion coinage, precious metals and high-value non-ferrous metals. A small percentage of shipping during this period was lost to storm, fire, acts of war, natural disasters and other causes, both known and unknown. The administration of this economic system required state-level bureaucratic oversight and record-keeping. Many of these historic records are available in publications, libraries, archives and digitized formats in depositories across the world. Though many records have been lost to time, enough remain to create in-depth, credible project profiles for potential excavation targets. To that end, we have created a series of regional and period-specific databases from which to compare, evaluate and select potential targets for research, discovery and eventual excavation and recovery. The graphics below are a visual representation of selected world regions containing our High Interest database of shipwrecks and their approximate location and time of sinking. 44 45 Before search or recovery operations may begin, we seek to understand every factor necessary to mount a recovery operation with a high probability of success. These factors include, but are not limited to: The historical context of the shipwreck, including political forces, technological developments, important contextual persons and events and the public reaction to the loss. Any images of the shipwreck, including still photography, motion pictures, drawing, paintings, recreations and/or models. A complete sinking timeline, including as much information as possible on weather patterns, departure date/time, intended course, course corrections, witness/observer statements. This includes any statement, fact or event material in any way to the sinking. A proposed search area with a high-probability of success, including an evaluation of all factors listed in the Sinking Timeline as well as any territorial boundaries or environmental factors. An Identification Guide, enabling rapid qualification or rejection of potential targets based on sonar and visual imagery, thus limiting expensive ship time on station. Cargo evaluation, evaluating the historical records on the targets cargo and potential modern-day value. Any encumbering factors, including territorial ownership of waters, insurance claims, potential cargo claims and sovereign rights. We will not begin a project without a legal path to possession. All of the above information is gleaned from publications, libraries, archives and digitized medium. Development of further projects is a continuous, ongoing process. 46 Search Most operational projects begin with a sonar search phase. We have outfitted our vessel with state-of-the-art sonar systems, an industry standard for underwater search operations. Our vessel tows the sonar systems to map the seafloor and search for targets. Potential targets are then selected from the sonar imagery using a combination of computerized post-processing and expert evaluation. While some shipwreck targets may be positively identified using high-resolution sonar system, others may need visual identification using an underwater camera ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) system or an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). Recovery Once a target is positively identified, excavation and recovery operations will begin using our Shackleton 1 light-work class ROV system, or other chartered ROV systems. Shackleton 1 will document the site using sonar, still and motion-picture imagery. It will then be used for any necessary excavation, as well as coinage, bullion and/or other recovery operations. Post-Recovery Conservation Coinage, precious metals and non-ferrous metals typically require a minimum amount of post-recovery conservation. In order to preserve the value of the recovered cargo, we will have an on-site facility capable of properly storing and transporting all recovered coinage, precious metals and non-ferrous metals to definitive and final conservation and storage prior to sale. Sales We intend to recover coinage and bullion precious metals, including but not limited to gold and silver. We believe that bullion metals, numismatically-graded coinage and non-graded coinage have significant value in the collector market. We intend to sell the existing independent coin dealers as well as directly to the collector and consumer market through the internet. Current & Ongoing Projects Project Connaught Research Summary The Connaught was a steam-powered packet ship, part of a fast and indispensable transatlantic communication link, the perfect vessel to rapidly ferry mails and passengers between Britain and the United States. Large for her time, she was a side-wheel steamer constructed almost entirely of iron. On her last voyage, the Connaught left Great Britain, bound for the United States. She carried several dozen first-class passengers, more than four hundred steerage passengers and a full crew of nearly 130. The Connaught also disembarked with a cargo of gold coins, and the Captain assumed an uneventful voyage According to reports, when heavy seas set in, the Connaught began to roll heavily. Though the initial problem was temporarily fixed, twelve hours later the same roll started again. Making matters worse, fire broke out. Buckets and pumps were manned, but the water rose rapidly and extinguished the furnaces, rendering the ship immobile. The fire quickly spread, driving the passengers above decks. The purser and two men attempted to rescue the gold shipment, but were driven back by the smoke and flames. A nearby ship came to the rescue, bravely maneuvering close to the Connaught and running a line between the two to facilitate transfer of passenger. Per age-old protocol, the Captain was the last man off the ship. 47 Virtually nothing was saved. Nearly every trunk and stitch of clothing was lost, including all the money of the first-class passengers. Early the next morning, a passing ship fell in with the Connaught, shadowing the stricken vessel through her final hours. The burning Connaught exploded and sank by the stern, leaving only an overturned lifeboat, light portions of the decking and a few trunks. The passing ship spent an hour recovering debris, dutifully recorded the sinking position, and then sailed on to New York. Historic image of Steamship Connaught Source: National Maritime Museum, Greenwich Project Connaught  Current Status In October of 2014 we positively identified the location of Project Sailfish, the Steamship Connaught through sonar imagery and video footage. In July 2015, we were granted exclusive salvage rights by the US Federal Courts, we returned to the site of the Connaught to begin salvage efforts, and retrieved the first artifacts from the debris field. Our salvage operations were temporarily hampered by the discovery of a mass of man-made debris and large commercial fishing nets concentrated around the aft section of the wreck. We have determined the appropriate equipment and methodology to clear these obstacles, and intend to return to the wreck site with these new tools as soon as practical. Given the task list and the short weather window that we can work in the North Atlantic, we intend to resume our salvage operations in summer of 2016. The cost of recovering the cargo of the Connaught is estimated to be $1,200,000 - $1,500,000. The Company needs additional working capital to recover the cargo of the Connaught . There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position to recover the cargo of the Connaught . 48 High-resolution sonar image of the steamship Connaught Source: Endurance Exploration Group, Inc.

This trade was based on the exchange of precious metals for goods, and silver was the only European payment acceptable to Asian trading partners. The Black Marlin was one such vessel engaged in this trade. She was an English East Indiaman, more than 700 tons, three decks high and armed with many cannon. In addition to the silver coin expected by Asian merchants, she also carried lace, golden fabric, beaver fur, tobacco, wine, cloth and iron nails. The shipping routes of the time took the English ship to the Indian Ocean for resupply in the middle of her long voyage to the East. According to reports, unknown to her Captain and crew, nearby European enemy ships were hunting for English shipping. They discovered the Black Marlin was in the area and sailed to intercept. The European enemy ships approached the English ship under a false flag and prepared to attack. The trap set and ready to attack, the Europeans demanded the surrender of the English vessel. Instead of surrendering, the English captain counterattacked, and the vessels began to exchange heavy cannon fire, beginning a pitched fight that would continue over many hours. In a last-ditch effort to escape, the English ship unfurled her sails and attempted to sail away. The Europeans quickly caught up and soon the English ship was disabled and unable to continue fighting. Rather than surrender, the Captain of the English ship set his own vessel on fire, escaping in a small boat with a chosen group of men while allowing his own ship and abandoned sailors to burn. The fire reached the gunpowder storage, and the English ship burned vigorously and sank, taking with her a rich cargo of silver. We believe this shipwreck lies at a depth of between 500-3000 meters of water. Woodcut graphic depicting the sinking of “ Black Marlin ” Source: “ A Sea Fight in 1690. (1893) Tuapeka Times, Rōrahi XXV. ” 51 Project “ Black Marlin ” – Current Status In November 2013, Endurance LLC entered into a contract with the sovereign government of an island nation in the Indian Ocean. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for the location and recover the Black Marlin and her silver cargo. We are currently pursuing an option to extend the existing contract. Net proceeds of our recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split between us (75%) and the island government (25%). The Company needs additional working capital to undertake the search for the Black Marlin. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in securing additional working capital and therefore cannot represent it will ever be in position to search for, or recover the Black Marlin. By selecting Black Marlin as our second project and since the Black Marlin was reported to have been lost within 12 nautical miles of land, it was necessary, in the ordinary course of our business, to seek permission of the coastal state to work in their territorial waters. We are not under any obligation to undertake this project and if, at any time, events in the area or our continuing research revealed a lost shipwreck that is a more logical choice to undertake as our second project, we will make that change in project priorities. Project Black Marlin  Targets of Opportunity Wahoo and Dolphin As part of discussions pertaining to project Black Marlin,  we have learned of two shallow-water targets of opportunity within the same territorial waters as the Black Marlin. Believed to be English East Indiaman, these wrecks (code-named Dolphin and Wahoo) remain unidentified at this time. Until these wrecks are identified, it will not be possible to generate any estimate on the potential value, if any. We expect to begin operations on these wrecks in conjunction with the Black Marlin in mid-2016. Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concession Currently, we neither own nor rely on any patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises. We have been granted a concession for shipwreck search and recovery in the territorial waters of an East African island nation by the government of that nation. The contract provides us with a three-year period in which to operate within the territorial waters of the nation with full permission to survey for and recover the Black Marlin and her silver cargo. Net proceeds of our recovery efforts, after payment of the costs to transport, store and insure any recovered items, will be split between us (75%) and the island government (25%). Competition There are a number of competing entities engaged in aquatic research, survey, inspection and the various aspects of the shipwreck salvage business. One or more of these competing entities may locate and recover a shipwreck that we intend to locate and recover. In addition, these competing entities may be better capitalized and may have greater resources to devote to their pursuit of shipwreck salvage. Governmental and Environmental Regulation We are subject to local, state and national taxation. Additionally, our operations are subject to a variety of national, federal, state, local and international laws. In particular, the legal, political, or civil initiatives of countries, international governing bodies and/or other maritime jurisdictions may restrict our operations and prevent or cause us to suspend or abort particular searches or salvage operations. 52 Project Black Marlin  Government or environmental regulations that may restrict our operations. The island nation has signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (the LOS). In this capacity and in keeping with the provisions of the LOS, the island nation asserts jurisdiction over its territorial waters, defined by the LOS as 12 nautical miles, 22.2 kilometers or 13.1 miles from the low water mark of the coastal state. Based upon our historical research, we believe the Black Marlin sank within the territorial waters of the island nation. While the island nation is not a signatory to nor has it ratified the International Convention on Salvage (ICS), the Company and its contractors operate in accordance the provisions of the ICS. Those provisions state generally, that in undertaking salvage a salvage company shall exercise due care in order to minimizing damage to the environment. Damage to the environment is defined by the Treaty under Article 1 (d) as follows: Damage to the environment means substantial physical damage to human health or to marine life or resources in coastal or inland waters or areas adjacent thereto, caused by pollution, contamination, fire, explosion or similar major incidents. The Company and its contractors take into account complying with the ISC when estimating costs for the Black Marlin cargo recovery operations. The island country has no written laws or regulations with respect to salvage operations in general and has placed no additional restrictions on the operations of the Company when it begins operations to locate and recover the Black Marlins cargo. Project Connaught  Government or environmental regulations that may restrict our operations. We believe that the target site identified as Connaught is the wreck of the Connaught a paddlewheel steamer that sank in October 1860. That shipwreck is located approximately 125 miles off the coast of the United States of America (U.S.). While the U.S. has not ratified the LOS, this location is recognized under U.S. law as being in international waters. The Company has elected to submit itself to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Courts by filing a case in admiralty on October 3, 2014 in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida. The process of adjudicating ownership and claims, including the Companys request for a salvage claim or, in the alternative, title to the ship and its cargo, will proceed in the U.S. Court pursuant to U.S. admiralty law. The right to salvage a privately own vessel is not subject to approval of the U.S. Courts or any government agency. Once a party has submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Courts, the Court can determine the ownership rights to the cargo salvaged and the amount of a salvage award according to precedent cases ruled upon by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Company makes its claims based upon those legal precedents. The United States Coast Guard undertakes marine environmental protection in U.S. waters pursuant to Volume IX of its Marine Environmental Protection  Marine Safety Manual  COMDTINST M16000.14. As specified in Chapter 1 on page 16, the U.S. Coast Guard also looks to the International Convention on Salvage for guidance on salvage operations even though the U.S. has not ratified that treaty. The Company and its contractors expect to conduct salvage operations within the guidelines of the ICS. The Company and its contractors take into account complying with the ISC when estimating costs for the Connaught cargo recovery operations. 53 MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Set forth below is the name, age and present principal occupation or employment, and material occupations, positions, offices or employments for the past five years of our current directors and executive officers: Officers and Directors Name Age Position Micah Eldred 47 Director, President, Chief Executive Officer Carl Dilley 60 Director and Vice President Christine Zitman 46 Director, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer Guy M.

Term of Office Our directors are appointed for one year terms to hold office until the next annual meeting of our shareholders or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our executive officers are appointed by our Board of Directors and hold office pursuant to employment agreements or until removed by the board. Family Relationships There are no family relationships between or among the directors or executive officers. Director Independence The Board had no independent Directors. Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings During the past ten years there are no events that occurred related to an involvement in legal proceedings that are material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any of our directors, persons nominated to become directors or executive officers. Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Ethics within the meaning of Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Code of Ethics is required that applies to directors and senior officers, such as the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, controller, and persons performing similar functions. Nominations for Directors We do not have a nominating committee. The Board of Directors, sitting as a Board, selects individuals to stand for election as members of the Board. Since the Board of Directors does not include a majority of independent directors, the decision of the Board as to director nominees is made by persons who have an interest in the outcome of the determination. The Board will consider candidates for directors proposed by security holders, although no formal procedures for submitting candidates have been adopted. Unless otherwise determined, not less than 90 days prior to the next annual Board of Directors meeting at which the slate of Board nominees is adopted, the Board will accept written submissions of proposed nominees that include the name, address and telephone number of the proposed nominee; a brief statement of the nominees qualifications to serve as a director; and a statement as to why the shareholder submitting the proposed nominee believes that the nomination would be in the best interests of shareholders. If the proposed nominee is not the same person as the shareholder submitting the name of the nominee, a letter from the nominee agreeing to the submission of his or her name for consideration should be provided at the time of submission. The letter should be accompanied by a résumé supporting the nominees qualifications to serve on the Board of Directors, as well as a list of references. 57 The Board identifies director nominees through a combination of referrals from different people, including management, existing Board members and security holders. Once a candidate has been identified, the Board reviews the individuals experience and background and may discuss the proposed nominee with the source of the recommendation. If the Board believes it to be appropriate, Board members may meet with the proposed nominee before making a final determination whether to include the proposed nominee as a member of managements slate of director nominees submitted to shareholders for election to the Board. Among the factors that the Board considers when evaluating proposed nominees are their knowledge of, and experience in business matters, finance, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. The Board may request additional information from the candidate prior to reaching a determination. The Board is under no obligation to formally respond to all recommendations, although as a matter of practice, it will endeavor to do so. Audit Committee The functions of an audit committee are currently carried out by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that we do not have an audit committee financial expert on our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has determined that the cost of hiring a financial expert to act as a Director and to be a member of an audit committee or otherwise perform audit committee functions outweighs the benefits of having a financial expert. 58 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance Reporting As we do not have a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our directors and officers, and persons who own more than ten-percent (10%) of our common stock, are not required to file reports of ownership on Form 3 and reports of changes in ownership on Forms 4 and 5, with the SEC.

COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Our Articles of Incorporation provides that we shall indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law and that none of our directors will be personally liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability: · for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders; · for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law; · under Nevada law for the unlawful payment of dividends; or · for any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit. These provisions require us to indemnify our directors and officers unless restricted by Nevada law and eliminate our rights and those of our stockholders to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of his or her fiduciary duty of care as a director except in the situations described above. The limitations summarized above, however, do not affect our ability or that of our stockholders to seek non-monetary remedies, such as an injunction or rescission, against a director for breach of his fiduciary duty. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 72 WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION We filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 for the common shares in this offering.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statement of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has significant net losses and cash flow deficiencies. Those conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding those matters are described in Note B. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2015 NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows. Description of Business Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation) (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 19, 2006, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hemis Corporation. On December 1, 2006 Hemis declared a dividend of Tecton shares to all shareholders as of that date and concurrently cancelled its share ownership in the Company. The effect of this dividend declaration and share cancellation was that Tecton was spun off as an independent company. On November 8, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a change of the Companys fiscal year from January 31, to December 31. On December 31, 2013 the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company, in exchange for 20,550,539 shares of the Companys Common Stock being issued to the former members. Endurance Exploration Group LLC is now a wholly owned subsidiary with its operations being the Companys primary focus. Endurance Exploration Group LLC  is engaged in the archaeologically sensitive exploration and recovery of deep-ocean shipwrecks throughout the world. We intend to recover bullion precious metals, numismatic-grade coinage, high-value non-ferrous metals and other valuable cargos from both historic and modern shipwrecks. On January 2, 2014 the Company changed its name to Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. Our corporate headquarters are located in Clearwater, Florida. Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation These consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation) and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015. The acquisition of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group LLC and its wholly owned Panamanian subsidiary formed to hold the registry of a research vessel occurred as of the close of its business on December 31, 2013. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F-6 Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated subsequent events through March 9, 2016 to assess the need for potential recognition or disclosure in this report. Based upon this evaluation, management determined that all subsequent events that require recognition in the financial statements have been included. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at historical cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method at rates based on the assets estimated useful lives which are normally between three and ten years. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or lease term, if shorter. Equipment and Major overhaul items (such as engines or generators) that enhance or extend the useful life of vessel related assets qualify to be capitalized and depreciated over the useful life or remaining life of that asset, whichever is shorter. Certain major repair items required by industry standards to ensure a vessels seaworthiness also qualify to be capitalized and depreciated over the period of time until the next scheduled planned major maintenance for that item. All other repairs and maintenance are accounted for under the direct-expensing method and are expensed when incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no impairment losses recognized for long-lived assets. Income Taxes The Company uses the liability method to record income tax activity. Deferred taxes are determined based upon the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of currently enacted tax laws. The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements uses the threshold of more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination for inclusion or exclusion. Measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold has been met. Net Earnings (Losses) Per Common Share The Company computes earnings (loss) per share by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. Dilutive common stock equivalents may consist of shares issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred shares and the exercise of the Companys stock options (calculated using the treasury stock method). As of December 31, 2015, there were 5,574,000 common stock equivalents that were anti-dilutive and were not included in the calculation. Common stock issuable is considered outstanding as of the original approval date for purposes of earnings per share computations. F-7 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of financial instruments, which include cash, loans receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and advances from related parties were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Management is of the opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from financial instruments. Comprehensive Income The Company records comprehensive income as the change in equity of a business during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. As of December 31, 2015 the Company had no items that represent comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation costs are measured at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The Company determines the fair value of awards using the Black - Scholes valuation model. New Accounting Pronouncements The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. No new standards had any material effect on these financial statements. The accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to the date of these financial statements that were considered significant by management were evaluated for the potential effect on these consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent pronouncements will have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements as presented and does not anticipate the need for any future restatement of these consolidated financial statements because of the retro-active application of any accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to December 31, 2015 through the date these financial statements were issued. NOTE B  GOING CONCERN MATTERS The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements for the period January 19, 2006 (date of inception) to December 31, 2015, the Company incurred losses of $6,957,840. The Company has minimal liquid assets. These factors, among others, indicate that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Companys existence is dependent upon managements ability to develop profitable operations and resolve its liquidity problems. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. F-8 NOTE C  ACQUISITION OF ENDURANCE EXPLORATION GROUP LLC MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS On December 31, 2013 the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company by issuing 20,550,539 shares of its common stock. The majority shareholders of Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Tecton Corporation) also held a majority interest in Endurance Exploration Group LLC, and maintained controlling interests in both entities both before and after the transaction. Accordingly, the acquisition has been accounted for as a corporate re-organization because of the common control. The book value of Endurance Exploration Group LLC at the time of the acquisition was as follows: Cash $ 1,940 Fixed assets - net 448,980 Other assets 3,805 Total assets $ 454,725 Accounts payable assumed $ 8,927 Accrued expenses assumed 4,625 Shareholder loans assumed 60,000 Equity acquired 381,173 Total liabilities and equity $ 454,725 NOTE D  PREPAID EXPENSES On May 15, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Eclipse Group, Inc. to provide services, equipment and/or personnel in support of anticipated Endurance salvage projects, to inspect and recover one or more shipwreck cargoes located by Endurance. The Company issued 2,000,000 common shares at $.25 per share with a value of $500,000. These shares represent a prepayment for Eclipse services pursuant to a schedule of agreed upon costs and rates. Eclipse will invoice the Company on a monthly basis as services are rendered. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Eclipse rendered $150,000 of the services outlined in this agreement, and consequently the remaining balance of $350,000 is included in current assets as a prepaid expense. NOTE E  FIXED ASSETS Fixed assets consist of the following at December 31, 2015 and 2014: December 31, December 31, 2015 2014 Vessels and equipment $ 665,323 $ 610,379 Computers and peripherals 14,092 14,092 679,415 624,471 Less: Accumulated depreciation (355,800) (256,769) Fixed Assets - net $ 323,615 $ 367,702 Depreciation expense was $99,031 and $94,488 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. F-9 NOTE F  ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Loans and notes payable to related parties at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as detailed below are summarized as follows: December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Notes payable  related parties $ 60,000 $ 60,000 Advances from related parties 95,500 281,500 $ 155,500 $ 341,500 On December 31, 2013, the Company completed the purchase of 100% of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC (Endurance LLC), from its members, Micah Eldred and Carl Dilley, in exchange for 20,550,539 shares of the Companys common stock, valued at $0.0186 per share, based upon the net book value of the assets of Endurance LLC, $381,173 as of December 31, 2013. On December 31, 2013, as a consequence of acquiring the membership interests of Endurance LLC, the Company assumed a liability of Endurance LLC to Micah Eldred under a demand promissory note, dated June 19, 2012, in the original principal amount of $60,000, bearing interest at 5%. The note has no stipulated maturity date, and the balance due under the note at December 31, 2015, including accrued interest, was $67,625. The Company has entered into a contract with Island Capital Management LLC, which is owned and controlled by Micah Eldred and Carl Dilley, to serve as its transfer agent. It did not charge the Company for its services during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014. The Company has entered into a contract with Proxy & Printing, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Micah Eldred and Carl Dilley, to provide the Company with EDGAR, XBRL and Proxy services relating to its filings with the SEC. It did not charge the Company for its services during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014. On April 7, 2014, the Company entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement with Endeavour relating to the conversion of indebtedness to Endeavour in the amount of $35,000. This amount represents advances received from Endeavour during 2014 and constitutes the balance of the related party debt payable to Endeavour as of that date. The terms of the agreement allowed for Endeavour to convert this debt into common stock at $0.25 per share. Endeavour converted all of such debt into shares, as a result of which the Company issued 140,000 shares to Endeavour. On April 7, 2014, the Company entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement with Island, a company owned and controlled by Endeavour, relating to the conversion of indebtedness to Island in the amount of $70,000. This amount represents advances received from Island during 2014 and constitutes the balance of the related party debt payable to Island as of that date. The terms of the agreement allowed for Island to convert this debt into common stock at $0.25 per share. Island converted all of such debt into shares, as a result of which the Company issued 280,000 shares to Island. F-10 On June 23, 2014, the Company entered into a contract with Eclipse Group Inc. (Eclipse) for Eclipse to provide personnel and services to the Company in connection with the operation and monitoring of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in connection with our investigation of a suspected shipwreck located off the coast of New England. Steven Saint Amour, who serves as a member of the Companys Board of Directors, and Joan Saint Amour are the principal shareholders and officers of Eclipse. The contract provides that Eclipse will provide 2 people, including Mr. Saint Amour, for approximately four 12-hour days to operate and monitor the ROV, which will be provided by the Company.

On September 3, 2014, the Company entered into a contract with Overseas Marine Vessel Corp, LLC (OMVC) pursuant to which it will provide the Marine Vessel Manisee in support of an estimated 10-day mission to investigate, identify and recovery artifacts from one or more shipwrecks located in our search area off the coast of New England. We will reimburse OMVC in cash for all its out-of-pocket expenses only, including but not limited to, mooring, food, fuel, normal maintenance, satellite communications and crew costs.

These dispositions may be at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market price, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. The selling shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when disposing of shares or interests therein: - ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; - block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; - purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; - an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; - privately negotiated transactions; - short sales effected after the date the registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part is declared effective by the SEC; - through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; - broker-dealers may agree with the selling shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; and - a combination of any such methods of sale. The selling shareholders may, from time to time, pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the common shares owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the common shares, from time to time, under this prospectus, or under an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending the list of selling shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling shareholders under this prospectus. The selling shareholders also may transfer the securities in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. 84 In connection with the sale of our common shares or interests therein, the selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling shareholders may also sell shares of our common shares short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). The aggregate proceeds to the selling shareholders from the sale of the common shares offered by them will be the purchase price of the common shares less discounts or commissions, if any. Each of the selling shareholders reserves the right to accept and, together with their agents from time to time, to reject, in whole or in part, any proposed purchase of common shares to be made directly or through agents. We will not receive any of the proceeds from this offering. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling shareholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchase of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. The selling shareholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved, and in no case will the maximum compensation received by any broker-dealer exceed eight percent (8%). The selling shareholders also may resell all or a portion of the shares in open market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 under the Securities Act, provided that they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of that rule.

Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On May 6, 2013, we entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement with Endeavour Cooperative Partners LLC, a company controlled by Micah Eldred and Carl Dilley which was our largest shareholder at the time, relating to the conversion of indebtedness to Endeavour in the amount of $272,356. This amount represents the debt payable to Endeavour as of that date. The terms of the agreement allowed for Endeavour to convert this debt into preferred stock at $.000172 per share (pre-reverse split), which value was determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and reasonable at the time. The Company did not have sufficient common shares available for issuance in exchange for the debt on these terms, so it was agreed that the Company would issue shares of preferred stock, and such preferred shares would be exchanged on a one-for-one basis in the future for shares of common stock. Although the market price of the common stock was hovering around $0.0002 per share at the time, the Board determined that the market price was not reflective of the true value of the stock. Indications of this included the following facts: · there was very minimal trading activity in the Companys stock, · as of April 30, 2013, the Company had no assets and negative shareholders equity of $352,786, and · between December 15, 2012 and May 3, 2013, Endeavour Cooperative Partners LLC had purchased approximately 29,900,000 shares of Company stock from other shareholders at a price of $0.0001 per share. On May 8, 2013, Endeavour filed a notice of conversion for $3,400 of its debt, in exchange for 19,736,560 of pre-reverse split preferred shares. These shares converted to 493,414 shares of preferred stock after the reverse split, and were converted into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis on December 31, 2013. On December 31, 2013, we entered into an Addendum to the Debt Conversion Agreement, dated May 6, 2013, with Endeavour Cooperative Partners LLC, relating to the conversion of indebtedness to Endeavour in the amount of $289,390. This amount represents the related party debt payable to Endeavour as of that date. The terms of the agreement allowed for Endeavour to convert this debt into common stock at $0.022727 per share, which the Board believed to be based on the value of the stock prior to the closing of the acquisition of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC later that day, based on recent trading activity. Endeavour converted all of such debt into shares on such date, as a result of which we issued 12,733,499 shares to Endeavour. 89 On December 31, 2013, we completed the purchase of 100% of the membership interests of Endurance Exploration Group, LLC (Endurance LLC), from its members in exchange for 20,550,539 shares of our common stock, valued at $0.0186 per share, based upon the net book value of the assets of Endurance LLC of $381,173 as of December 31, 2013. On December 31, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the issuance of, and we issued, options to purchase an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.25 per share any time prior to December 31, 2015. Options were issued to our directors (Micah Eldred, Carl Dilley and Christine Zitman), our employees and certain consultants and service providers as compensation for services rendered and as an inducement for the consultants (Guy Zajonc, Steven Saint Amour) to join our Board of Directors.

On April 7, 2014, we entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement with Island Capital Management, LLC, a company owned and controlled by Endeavour Cooperative Partners LLC, relating to the conversion of indebtedness to Island in the amount of $70,000. This amount represents the related party debt payable to Island as of that date. The terms of the agreement allowed for Island to convert this debt into common stock at $0.25 per share. Island converted all of such debt into shares, as a result of which we issued 280,000 shares to Island. Also, in April 2014, we issued 13,333 shares in satisfaction of those shares that have been issuable since 2008 as explained in Note G of the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Undertakings (A) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: i. To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; ii. To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement. iii. To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Provided, however , that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (6) The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (§ 230.424 of this chapter); (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. 94 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Clearwater, FL, on the 18 th day of April, 2016.
