Because it is a summary, it may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand this offering fully, you should read this entire prospectus and the financial statements and related notes included in this prospectus carefully, including the Risk Factors section. Unless the context requires otherwise, we, us, our,  and the company and similar terms refer to Capital Markets Technologies, Inc., and our subsidiaries collectively, while the term Capital Markets Technologies refers to Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. in its corporate capacity. Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. We were incorporated in the State of Florida on June 29, 1995 under the name RLN Realty Associates, Inc. with an authorized share capital of 7,500 shares of common stock with a $1.00 par value per share. The following amendments have occurred:  June 9, 1998: increase in authorized share capital to 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a $.001 par value per share. In addition to increasing the authorized capital, RLN Realty Associates authorized a split of its 5,000 outstanding shares of common stock on a 200-for-1 basis effective on June 9, 1998. On June 12, 1998, RLN Realty Associates filed an application on Form 211 for its common stock to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, which was approved on June 18, 1998.  March 1, 1999: corporate name change from RLN Realty Associates, Inc. to Netmaximizer.com, Inc.  October 19, 1999: a 3 for 1 split of common stock effective as of November 1, 1999  April 10, 2000: an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation increasing the total number of shares that may be issued to 77,000,000, consisting of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share and 2,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.  October 3, 2005: change in corporate name from Netmaximizer.com, Inc. to Gentech Pharma, Inc. and concurrently authorized a reverse split of the common stock on a 500 for 1 basis.  December 19, 2005: increase authorized capital to 100,000,000 common shares.  September 1, 2006: change in corporate name from Gentech Pharma, Inc. to Fintech Group, Inc.  September 1, 2006: amend and restate Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized common shares to 250,000,000 par value $.001 and Preferred stock to 10,000,000 shares par value $.001.  February 8, 2007: change in corporate name from Fintech Group, Inc. to Capital Markets Technologies, Inc.  Our name change to Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. in 2007 was done to reflect our current focus. We are currently operating as a financial technology solutions company providing innovative technology to global financial institutions and major corporations. The company is currently operating in Chicago, and will also operate out of London, England upon finalization of the proposed acquisition of Simplex Consulting. We initially changed our focus in order to capitalize on the estimated US$30 billion financial technology market opportunity which management believes exists within Europe over the next three years. Our management has an aggressive acquisitions strategy focusing on companies which are already well positioned to take advantage of the paradigm shift occurring in the financial technology markets under the European Union regulatory directives: MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area). Europes entire financial technology landscape is set to change by 2010 as a result of MiFID and SEPA which make it mandatory for each of Europes 8,000 Financial Institutions (FIs) to change their IT systems and trade processes. The effects of these directives will impact tens of thousands of non-bank FIs and euro-zone corporate treasuries. Through a number of acquired subsidiaries, CMT will position itself to provide its global tier 1 and 2 financial services customers with financial technology solutions which help them comply with, or capitalize on the worlds most significant financial services legislation ever seen. On December 17, 2007 CMT announced that it has signed a letter of intent to acquire UK-based Strike IT Services, (Strike IT) an IT consulting firm in the corporate treasury and financial applications market. The proposed acquisition will bring a formidable team of additional resources to CMT as well as strong management. CMT and its subsidiaries will benefit from the cost savings associated with rationalization and an enhanced sales force. In addition it is expected that MiFID and SEPA resourcing requirements will provide a solid foundation of business for CMT in both consulting and solutions divisions during the coming years. 1 Table of Contents Strike IT Services is an IT consultancy and recruitment company which has a number of corporate customers for whom it provides resources around SAP (SAP is the worlds largest business software company) and the treasury operations. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) operates a worldwide financial messaging network. On this network messages are guaranteed by SWIFT to be securely and reliably exchanged between banks and other financial institutions. SWIFT also markets software and services to financial institutions, much of it for use on the SWIFTNet Network. The majority of international interbank messages use the SWIFT network. As of April 2006 SWIFT linked almost 8,000 financial institutions in 205 countries. SWIFT does not facilitate funds transferfinancial institutions need a corresponding banking relationship for financial transactions. SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law and it is owned by its member financial institutions. SWIFT headquarters are located in La Hulpe, Belgium. In addition, Strike IT is planning to open an office in a location to be determined by management in 2 nd quarter 2008 to tap into the increasing opportunities in the financial resourcing sector presented by MiFID and SEPA. On November 15, 2007, our management announced that a definitive share purchase agreement (Agreement) was executed for the sale of Simplexs UK subsidiary, Simplex Consulting Ltd (Simplex Consulting) to Capital Markets Technologies. Simplex Consulting is a UK-based consulting firm specializing in wholesale payments and post-trade processing technologies and provides services in the banking and securities markets. Simplex Consulting Ltd. is one of Europes leading financial technology consultancies focusing on business change, systems implementation and STP within the Banking, Securities and corporate treasury marketplaces. Simplex was established in 1997 to provide a high quality systems implementation service focusing on the middleware and evolving STP and exception based processing requirements of financial institutions. Simplex is an accredited SWIFT Service Partner, and operates a SWIFT Service Bureau, offering an outsourced SWIFTNet connectivity service, and a range of value added outsourced applications. Although not incorporated by reference to this filing, further information regarding Simplex can be found at www.simplexconsulting.com and further information about us can be found at www.capitalmarketstech.com . Simplex is one of only three SWIFT Service Partners in the UK, Ireland and Nordic territories and runs a SWIFT Service Bureau providing outsourced connectivity to the SWIFT Network and other value-added services. Simplexs customer base includes a number of the worlds leading financial institutions as well as asset managers, hedge funds and large corporations. CMT is aiming to finalize the transaction this year, although no assurances can be made that such transaction will be finalized. Simplexs current parent company has completed the conversion of debt to equity with all convertible bond holders The Simplex transaction represents an integral part of our business strategy. Simplex has been in the financial technology consulting business for a decade and has a deep understanding of the European financial technology markets. Simplexs domain expertise combined with CMTs aggressive expansion plans and financing strengths will allow both parties to focus on their respective expertise to realize a common goal in Europe. In furtherance of its expansion plan, on September 28, 2007, the Company acquired 55% of iBase Solutions Limited, a private company incorporated in England specializing in optimizing post-trade processes for financial institutions. The Company paid $2,268 for the common shares. The minority shareholders are individuals residing in England. iBases principal product is software which provides a pay-as-you-go service which automates interest and dividend claims between financial institutions and their counter parties. Principal target markets are key financial centres. The Company will pursue global custodian banks and their asset management and hedge fund clients. The service is asp-enabled and sits on top of a swift service bureau belonging to a prospective acquisition target of Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. The iBase products are designed to also assist companies in complying with the changes contemplated under MiFID and SEPA, which are the regulations to be enforced by the European Commission. 2 Table of Contents The product naturally links to Simplexs SWIFT Bureau to form a complete solution to this market issue. The product is currently scheduled to be finished in late spring of 2008 when it will be presented to the International Securities Association for International Trade Communication (ISITC) sub-committee for claims. The ultimate ambition for iBase is for it to be recognized as the industry standard for claims processing in a similar fashion to SWIFT, which has been following the progress of iBase. Under both the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), legal requirements for transparency throughout the entire financial transaction lifecycle are set to be introduced. iBases products will target a number of the most inefficient processes within back office operations, currently handled by expensive and operationally risky manual processes. iBase will be working closely with London-based Simplex, a company which specializes in providing outsourced payments and post-trade processing services and which CMT is in the process of acquiring. Simplex already has a number of the worlds leading financial institutions using its outsourced solutions. iBase will further enhance the functionality of Simplexs existing offer, allowing for cross-selling opportunities to new and existing customers and will bring significant additional reconciliations. The Offering This prospectus relates to the sale of up to 7,046,378 currently issued and outstanding shares of our common stock by the selling security holders. We agreed to file a registration statement with the Commission in order to register the resale of the common shares issued to the selling security holders. As of May 22, 2008, we had 21,308,660 shares of common stock outstanding. The number of shares registered under this prospectus would represent approximately 33% of the total common stock outstanding. The common shares offered under this prospectus may not be sold by the selling security holders, except in negotiated transactions with a broker-dealer or market maker as principal or agent, or in privately negotiated transactions not involving a broker or dealer. Information regarding the selling security holders, the common shares they are offering to sell under this prospectus and the times and manner in which they may offer and sell those shares is provided in the sections of this prospectus captioned Selling Security Holders and Plan of Distribution. RISK FACTORS We are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing before deciding to purchase our common stock. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The Report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting firm Contains Explanatory Language that Substantial Doubt Exists About our Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The independent auditors report on our financial statements contains explanatory language that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern. The report states that we depend on the continued contributions of our executive officers to work effectively as a team, to execute our business strategy and to manage our business. The loss of key personnel, or their failure to work effectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing in the near term or achieve profitability, then we would, in all likelihood, experience severe liquidity problems and may have to curtail our operations. If we curtail our operations, we may be placed into bankruptcy or undergo liquidation, the result of which will adversely affect the value of our common shares. WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY WITH SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND EXPECT LOSSES TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME, THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND YOU COULD EVEN LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. 3 Table of Contents We have yet to establish any history of profitable operations as shown in our independent certified financial audit for 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of $13,347,202. We have incurred annual operating losses of $ 34,727 for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $ 919,272 for the year ended December 31, 2007. We have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities in private placement transactions. WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE PUBLIC MARKET, PRIVATE DEBT OR PRIVATE SALES OF EQUITY TO ACHIEVE OUR CURRENT BUSINESS STRATEGY OF COMPLETING AND PROFITING FROM OUR SUITE OF TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS. OUR NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN THE FUTURE WILL LIKELY INVOLVE THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF STOCK, WHICH COULD DILUTE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL MONIES IN THE FUTURE. We will require additional financing to sustain our operations, without which we may not be able to continue operations. Our inability to raise additional working capital or to raise the required financing in a timely manner would negatively impact our ability to fund our operations, our ability to generate revenues and to otherwise execute our business plan. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain additional financing, that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us or that the holders of the secured debentures will provide their consent to permit us to enter into subsequent financing arrangements. This can lead to the reduction or suspension of our operations and ultimately our going out of business. Should this occur, the value of your investment in the common stock could be adversely affected, and you could lose your entire investment. RISKS RELATING TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK Although there is presently a market for our common stock, the price of our common stock may be extremely volatile and investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above their purchase price, or at all. We anticipate that the market may be potentially highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially because of:  Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our future business and operating results;  Changes in or failure to meet market expectations;  Fluctuations in stock market price and volume WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We may not have sufficient funds to legally pay dividends. Even if funds are legally available to pay dividends, we may nevertheless decide in our sole discretion not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors our board of directors may consider relevant. There is no assurance that we will pay any dividends in the future, and, if dividends are rapid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. OUR INABILITY TO RETAIN OUR KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WOULD IMPEDE OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND GROWTH STRATEGIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT. Our success depends, to a critical extent, on the continued efforts and services of our Chief Executive Officer, Hagop Bouroudjian, our President, Pasquale Ceci and our Director and Chief Financial Officer, Edward Arana. Were we to lose any of these key executive officers, we would be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of a replacement, which would result in both a delay in the implementation of our business plan and the diversion of limited working capital. We can give you no assurance that we can find satisfactory replacements for these key executive officers at all, or on terms that are not unduly expensive or burdensome to our Company. We do not currently carry a key-man life insurance policy on any of our employees, which would assist us in recouping our costs in the event of the loss of those officers. POSSIBLE PENNY STOCK REGULATION Any trading of our common stock in the Pink Sheets or on the OTC Bulletin Board may be subject to certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, commonly referred to as the penny stock rule. 4 Table of Contents Our common stock is deemed to be penny stock as that term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Penny stocks are stock:  With a price of less than $5.00 per share;  That are not traded on a recognized national exchange;  Whose prices are not quoted on the Nasdaq automated quotation system (Nasdaq listed stock must still have a price of not less than $5.00 per share); or  In issuers with net tangible assets less than $2.0 million (if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years) or $5.0 million (if in continuous operation for less than three years), or with average revenues of less than $6.0 million for the last three years. Broker/dealers dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks. Moreover, broker/dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. These requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline. BECAUSE WE ARE QUOTED ON THE OTCBB INSTEAD OF AN EXCHANGE OR NATIONAL QUOTATION SYSTEM, OUR INVESTORS MAY HAVE A TOUGHER TIME SELLING THEIR STOCK OR EXPERIENCE NEGATIVE VOLATILITY ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK. Our common stock is traded on the OTCBB. The OTCBB is often highly illiquid, in part because it does not have a national quotation system by which potential investors can follow the market price of shares except through information received and generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is a greater chance of volatility for securities that trade on the OTCBB as compared to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility may be caused by a variety of factors, including the lack of readily available price quotations, the absence of consistent administrative supervision of bid and ask quotations, lower trading volume, and market conditions. Investors in our common stock may experience high fluctuations in the market price and volume of the trading market for our securities. These fluctuations, when they occur, have a negative effect on the market price for our securities. Accordingly, our stockholders may not be able to realize a fair price from their shares when they determine to sell them or may have to hold them for a substantial period of time until the market for our common stock improves. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. It may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the additional internal controls, processes and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal auditing and other finance staff in order to develop and implement appropriate additional internal controls, processes and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with these requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires of publicly traded companies. If we fail to comply in a timely manner with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding internal control over financial reporting or to remedy any material weaknesses in our internal controls that we may identify, such failure could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and current SEC regulations, beginning with our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal period ending December 31, 2007, we will be required to prepare assessments regarding internal controls over financial reporting and beginning with our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal period ending December 31, 2008, furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. We have begun the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy these requirements, which is likely to result in increased general and administrative expenses and may shift management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. While our management is 5 Table of Contents expending significant resources in an effort to complete this important project, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our objective on a timely basis. There also can be no assurance that our auditors will be able to issue an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment or complete our Section 404 certifications could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, in connection with our on-going assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we may discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as defined in standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The PCAOB defines significant deficiency as a deficiency that results in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. In the event that a material weakness is identified, we will employ qualified personnel and adopt and implement policies and procedures to address any material weaknesses that we identify. However, the process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take will remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial process and reporting in the future. Any failure to complete our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify or to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations of our internal controls and, in the case of a failure to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, would adversely affect the annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND THIS OFFERING THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON SHARES IS PARTICULARLY VOLATILE GIVEN OUR STATUS AS A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMPANY WITH A SMALL AND THINLY TRADED PUBLIC FLOAT, LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND LACK OF PROFITS WHICH COULD LEAD TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR SHARE PRICE. THE PRICE AT WHICH YOU PURCHASE OUR COMMON SHARES MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE PRICE THAT WILL PREVAIL IN THE TRADING MARKET. YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL YOUR COMMON SHARES AT OR ABOVE YOUR PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO YOU. The market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, our common shares are sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price. Secondly, we are a speculative or risky investment due to our limited operating history and lack of profits to date, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common shares will be at any time, including as to whether our common shares will sustain their current market prices, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common shares for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price. 6 Table of Contents Shareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price. WE ARE A SHELL COMPANY AND OUR SHARES WILL BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON RESALE. As we currently have nominal operations and our assets consist of cash, and/or cash equivalents, we will be deemed a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, until we are no longer a shell company, i.e until we will file a Form 10 level disclosure, and continue to be a reporting company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and for twelve months thereafter, shareholders holding restricted, non-registered shares will not be able to use the exemptions provided under Rule 144 for the resale of their shares of common stock. Preclusion from any prospective investor using the exemptions provided by Rule 144 may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future to investors that require a shorter period before liquidity or may require us to expend limited funds to register their shares for resale in a future prospectus. VOLATILITY IN OUR COMMON SHARE PRICE MAY SUBJECT US TO SECURITIES LITIGATION, THEREBY DIVERTING OUR RESOURCES THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. As discussed in the preceding risk factors, the market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert managements attention and resources. THE SALE OF MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE ACCOMPANYING REGISTRATION STATEMENT COULD ENCOURAGE SHORT SALES BY THIRD PARTIES In many circumstances, the issuance of securities for companies that are traded on the OTCBB has the potential to cause a significant downward pressure on the price of common stock. This is especially the case if the shares being placed into the market exceed the markets ability to take up the increased stock or if we have not performed in such a manner to show that the debt raised will be used to grow the Company. Such an event could place further downward pressure on the price of common stock. If there are significant short sales of our stock, the price decline that would result from this activity will cause our share price to decline more so which in turn may cause long holders of our stock to sell their shares thereby contributing to sales of stock in the market. If there is an imbalance on the sell side of the market for our stock the price will decline. It is not possible to predict if the circumstances where by short sales could materialize or to what our share price could drop to. In some companies that have been subjected to short sales their stock price has dropped to near zero. We cannot provide any assurances that this situation will not happen to us. SHOULD ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INCORRECT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, BELIEVED, ESTIMATED, EXPECTED, INTENDED OR PLANNED. 7 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements regarding managements plans and objectives for future operations including plans and objectives relating to our planned marketing efforts and future economic performance. The forward-looking statements and associated risks set forth in this Prospectus include or relate to, among other things, (a) our projected sales and profitability, (b) our growth strategies, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our ability to obtain and retain sufficient capital for future operations, and (e) our anticipated needs for working capital. These statements may be found under Managements Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations and Business, as well as in this Prospectus generally. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the risks outlined under Risk Factors and matters described in this Prospectus generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this Prospectus will in fact occur. The forward-looking statements herein are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we will be able to make acquisitions on a timely basis, that we will retain the acquirees customers, that there will be no material adverse competitive or technological change in conditions in our business, that demand for our products will significantly increase, that our President and Chief Executive Officer will remain employed as such, that our forecasts accurately anticipate market demand, and that there will be no material adverse change in our operations or business or in governmental regulations affecting us or our manufacturers and/or suppliers. The foregoing assumptions are based on judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any such assumption could prove to be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in forward-looking statements will be realized. In addition, as disclosed elsewhere in the Risk Factors section of this prospectus, there are a number of other risks inherent in our business and operations which could cause our operating results to vary markedly and adversely from prior results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Growth in absolute and relative amounts of cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses or the occurrence of extraordinary events could cause actual results to vary materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Management decisions, including budgeting, are subjective in many respects and periodic revisions must be made to reflect actual conditions and business developments, the impact of which may cause us to alter marketing, capital investment and other expenditures, which may also materially adversely affect our results of operations. In light of significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included in this prospectus, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved. Some of the information in this prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Any statement in this prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus that is not a statement of an historical fact constitutes a forward-looking statement. Further, when we use the words may, expect, anticipate, plan, believe, seek, estimate, internal, and similar words, we intend to identify statements and expressions that may be forward- looking statements. We believe it is important to communicate certain of our expectations to our investors. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Many factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. You are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause our actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risk factors discussed below. Before you invest in our common stock, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described under Risk Factors in this prospectus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. With respect to the sale of unregistered securities referenced above, all transactions were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  1933 Act ), and Regulation D promulgated under the 1933 Act. In each instance, the purchaser had access to sufficient information regarding the Company so as to make an informed investment decision. USE OF PROCEEDS This Prospectus relates to shares of our common stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by certain selling stockholders. There will be no proceeds to us from the sale of shares of common stock in this offering. 8 Table of Contents SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS The following table presents information regarding the selling security holder. Unless otherwise stated below, to our knowledge no selling security holder nor any affiliate of such shareholder has held any position or office with, been employed by or otherwise has had any material relationship with us or our affiliates during the three years prior to the date of this prospectus. None of the selling security holders are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The selling security holders may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933. The number and percentage of shares beneficially owned before and after the sales is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. We believe that each individual or entity named has sole investment and voting power with respect to the securities indicated as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws, where applicable, except where otherwise noted. The total number of common shares sold under this prospectus may be adjusted to reflect adjustments due to stock dividends, stock distributions, splits, combinations or recapitalizations.

However, the selling security holders are under no obligation to sell all or any portion of the common shares offered for sale under this prospectus. Accordingly, no estimate can be given as to the amount or percentage of our common shares that will ultimately be held by the selling security holders upon termination of sales pursuant to this prospectus. (1) Applicable percentage of ownership is based on 21,308,660 shares as of May 22, 2008 (there are no securities exercisable or convertible into shares of common stock within 60 days of May 22, 2008, for each stockholder). Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Commission and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Shares of common stock subject to securities exercisable or convertible into shares of common stock that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2007 are deemed to be beneficially owned by the person holding such securities for the purpose of computing the percentage of ownership of such person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Note that affiliates are subject to Rule 144 and Insider trading regulations  percentage computation is for form purposes only. (2) 2128112 Ont. Inc. is owned by Cheryl Cheslea and Stewart Garner.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We are registering the shares of stock being offered by this prospectus for resale in accordance with certain registration rights granted the selling shareholders, including their pledgees, donees, transferees or other successors-in-interest, who may sell the shares from time to time, or who may also decide not to sell any or all of the shares that may be sold under this prospectus. We will pay all registration expenses including, without limitation, all the SEC and blue sky registration and filing fees, printing expenses, transfer agents and registrars fees, and the fees and disbursements of our outside counsel in connection with this offering, but the selling shareholders will pay all selling expenses including, without limitation, any underwriters or brokers fees or discounts relating to the shares registered hereby, or the fees or expenses of separate counsel to the selling shareholders. The selling stockholders and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The selling stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  a distribution to a selling stockholders partners, members or stockholders;  settlement of short sales;  broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;  a combination of any such methods of sale;  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; or  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. 10 Table of Contents The selling stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. Each selling stockholder does not expect these commissions and discounts relating to its sales of shares to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. In connection with the sale of our common stock or interests therein, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling stockholders may also sell shares of our common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). The selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. Selling shareholders that are either broker-dealers or affiliated with broker-dealers may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with resale of their shares. Any commissions received by such broker-dealers, affiliates, or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them will be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The selling stockholders, have informed us that at the time they purchased our common stock they did not, and currently do not have, any agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock being sold pursuant to this prospectus. We are required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the shares. We have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because selling stockholders may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus that qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. Each selling stockholder has advised us that they have not entered into any agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriter or broker-dealer regarding the sale of the resale shares. There is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the selling stockholders. We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares may be resold by the selling stockholders without registration and without regard to any volume limitations by reason of Rule 144(e) under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to the prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to our common stock for a period of two business days prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the selling stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale. 11 Table of Contents LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not a party to any pending litigation and none is contemplated or threatened. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company that involve risks and uncertainties. Certain statements included in this S-1, including, without limitation, statements related to anticipated cash flow sources and uses, and words including but not limited to anticipates, believes, plans, expects, future and similar statements or expressions, identify forward looking statements. Any forward-looking statements herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in the Companys business, including but not limited to, reliance on key customers and competition in its markets, market demand, product performance, technological developments, maintenance of relationships with key suppliers, difficulties of hiring or retaining key personnel and any changes in current accounting rules, all of which may be beyond the control of the Company. Management will elect additional changes to revenue recognition to comply with the most conservative SEC recognition on a forward going accrual basis as the model is replicated with other similar markets (i.e. SBDC). The Companys actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth therein. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included herein. OVERVIEW Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. (formerly known as Fintech Group, Inc.; Gentech Pharma, Inc.; Netmaximizer.com, Inc.) (CMT) was incorporated in the State of Florida on June 29, 1995 under the name RLN Realty Associates, Inc. During 2002, we closed our e-commerce business operations due to lack of funding. From 2002 through 2005, the Company had no business operations. During 2006, we changed our name to Fintech Group, Inc. and subsequently to Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. in 2007 in order to reflect our current focus. We are a financial technology solutions company providing innovative solutions to global financial institutions and major corporations. The Company is currently operating in Chicago, and will also operate out of London, England upon finalization of the proposed acquisition of Simplex Consulting. We initially changed our focus in order to capitalize on the estimated US$30 billion financial technology market opportunity which management believes exists within Europe over the next three years. Our management has an aggressive acquisitions strategy focusing on companies which are already well positioned to take advantage of the paradigm shift occurring in the financial technology markets under the European Union regulatory directives: MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area). On December 17, 2007 CMT announced that it has signed a letter of intent to acquire UK-based Strike IT Services, (Strike IT) an IT consulting firm in the corporate treasury and financial applications market. The proposed acquisition will bring a formidable team of additional resources to CMT as well as strong management. CMT and its subsidiaries will benefit from the cost savings associated with rationalization and an enhanced sales force. In addition it is expected that MiFID and SEPA resourcing requirements will provide a solid foundation of business for CMT in both consulting and solutions divisions during the coming years. Strike IT Services is an IT consultancy and recruitment company which has a number of corporate customers for whom it provides resources around SAP (SAP is the worlds largest business software company) and the treasury operations. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) operates a worldwide financial messaging network. On this network messages are guaranteed by SWIFT to be securely and reliably exchanged between banks and other financial institutions. SWIFT also markets software and services to financial institutions, much of it for use on the SWIFTNet Network. The majority of international interbank messages use the SWIFT network. As of April 2006 SWIFT linked almost 8,000 financial institutions in 205 countries. SWIFT does not facilitate funds transferfinancial institutions need a corresponding banking relationship for financial transactions. SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law and it is owned by its member financial institutions. SWIFT headquarters are located in La Hulpe, Belgium. In addition, Strike IT is planning to open an office in a location to be determined by management in 2 nd quarter 2008 to tap into the increasing opportunities in the financial resourcing sector presented by MiFID and SEPA. 12 Table of Contents On November 19, 2007, CMT announced that it had acquired a 55% equity stake in iBase Solutions Limited iBase, is a UK based financial solutions company specializing in optimizing post-trade processes for financial institutions. iBase is set to launch in late spring of 2008 a suite of software products and services designed to replace inefficient and costly manual processes inherent in todays marketplace in Europe. The iBase products are designed to also assist companies in complying with the changes contemplated under MiFID and SEPA, which are to be enforced regulation by the European Commission. The product naturally links to Simplexs SWIFT Bureau to form a complete solution to this market issue. The product is currently scheduled to be finished in late spring of 2008 when it will be presented to the International Securities Association for International Trade Communication (ISITC) sub-committee for claims. The ultimate ambition for iBase is for it to be recognized as the industry standard for claims processing in a similar fashion to SWIFT, which has been following the progress of iBase. Under both the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), legal requirements for transparency throughout the entire financial transaction lifecycle are set to be introduced. iBases products will target a number of the most inefficient processes within back office operations, currently handled by expensive and operationally risky manual processes. iBase will be working closely with London-based Simplex, a company which specializes in providing outsourced payments and post-trade processing services and which CMT is in the process of acquiring. Simplex already has a number of the worlds leading financial institutions using its outsourced solutions. iBase will further enhance the functionality of Simplexs existing offer, allowing for cross-selling opportunities to new and existing customers and will bring significant additional reconciliations. A further bonus to this acquisition is that it will allow Simplex to separate its consulting activities from its solutions business which has recently become a market issue, with Simplexs consulting objectivity having become subject to question when running directly alongside a growing solutions business. In January 2008, Capital Markets Technologies Inc. acquired 100% of the shares of a private company, CMT Europe Limited, incorporated in England for £125. The company has neither operations nor assets. The purpose of the company is to function as a holding company for all UK acquisitions. NET REVENUES We have had no revenues since 2002 when we closed our e-commerce business operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company closed our e-commerce business operations due to lack of funding in 2002. In the past we were an e-commerce department store that sold a wide variety of consumer goods to members of affinity groups, paying a commission on those sales to the affinity group. In 2002, we ceased our business operations due to lack of funding. During 2006, we changed our name to Fintech Group, Inc. and subsequently to Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. in 2007 to reflect our current focus. We are currently operating as a financial technology solutions company providing innovative solutions to global financial institutions and major corporations. The company is currently operating in Chicago, and will also operate out of London, England upon finalization of the proposed acquisition of Simplex Consulting. We initially changed our focus in order to capitalize on the estimated US$30 billion financial technology market opportunity which management believes exists within Europe over the next three years. Our management has an aggressive acquisitions strategy focusing on companies which are well positioned to take advantage of the paradigm shift occurring in the financial technology markets under the European Union regulatory directives: MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area). Other Considerations There are numerous factors that affect the business and the results of its operations. Sources of these factors include general economic and business conditions, federal and state regulation of business activities, the level of demand for product services, the level and intensity of competition and the ability to develop new services based on new or evolving technology and the markets acceptance of those new services, the Companys ability to timely and effectively manage periodic product transitions, the services, customer and geographic sales mix of any particular period, and our ability to continue to improve our infrastructure including personnel and systems to keep pace with the Companys anticipated rapid growth. 13 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. Certain officers and directors of the Company have provided personal guarantees to our various lenders as required for the extension of credit to the Company. Accounting Policies Subject to Estimation and Judgment Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When preparing our financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on our balance sheets and income statements, and our related disclosure about contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for income taxes, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, which we believe to be reasonable in order to form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily ascertained from other sources. Actual results may deviate from these estimates if alternative assumptions or condition are used. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE We retained Madsen & Associates, CPAs Inc. as our independent accountants to audit our financial statements effective as of December 31, 2007. Subsequent to that date, in connection with their audits of our financial statements, there were no disagreements with the predecessor auditor, Rachlin Cohen & Holtz, LLP, on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope and procedures. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS We were incorporated in the State of Florida on June 29, 1995 under the name RLN Realty Associates, Inc. with an authorized share capital of 7,500 shares of common stock with a $1.00 par value per share. The following amendments have occurred:  June 9, 1998: increase in authorized share capital to 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a $.001 par value per share. In addition to increasing the authorized capital, RLN Realty Associates authorized a split of its 5,000 outstanding shares of common stock on a 200-for-one basis effective on June 9, 1998.

Prior to our current business pursuits, we were an e-commerce department store that sold a wide variety of consumer goods to members of affinity groups, paying a commission on those sales to the affinity group. In 2002, we ceased our business operations as an e-commerce department store due to lack of funding. We were subsequently de-listed from the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board exchange to the pink sheets exchange for failure to file timely reports pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. 14 Table of Contents During 2006, we changed our name to Fintech Group, Inc. and subsequently in 2007, to Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. to reflect our current business focus. We are currently operating as a financial technology solutions company providing innovative solutions to global financial institutions and major corporations. The company is currently operating in Chicago, and will also operate out of London, England upon finalization of the proposed acquisition of Simplex Consulting. We initially changed our focus in order to capitalize on the estimated US$30 billion financial technology market opportunity which management believes exists within Europe over the next three years. Our management has an aggressive acquisitions strategy focusing on companies which are already well positioned to take advantage of the paradigm shift occurring in the financial technology markets under the European Union regulatory directives: MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area). Europes entire financial technology landscape is set to change by 2010 as a result of MiFID and SEPA which make it mandatory for each of Europes 8,000 Financial Institutions (FIs) to change their IT systems and trade processes. The effects of these directives will impact tens of thousands of non-bank FIs and euro-zone corporate treasuries. Through a number of acquired subsidiaries, CMT will position itself to provide its global tier 1 and 2 financial services customers with financial technology solutions helping them to comply with, or capitalize on the worlds most significant financial services legislation ever seen. MiFID, aims to create a pan-European securities market affecting thousands of securities firms as well as the outlook for Europes regional stock exchanges. SEPA will create the infrastructure which has yet to be rolled out to support the euro, and will remove cross border payments from within the euro zone. These two directives are set to cost the financial services industry an estimated US$30 billion in business process re-engineering and technology changes before 2010 according to MiFID. CMT aims to capitalize on this opportunity by gaining a foothold in the European financial technology markets, and with it, a depth of local market knowledge in order to truly understand the implications and opportunities which regulatory change will provide. On November 15, 2007, our management released that they executed a definitive share purchase agreement (Agreement) regarding the sale of Simplexs UK subsidiary, Simplex Consulting Ltd (Simplex Consulting) to Capital Markets Technologies. Simplex Consulting is a UK-based consulting firm specializing in wholesale payments and post-trade processing technologies and services in the banking and securities markets. CMT is aiming to finalize the transaction this year, although no assurances can be made that such transaction will be finalized. Simplexs current parent company has completed the conversion of debt to equity with all convertible bond holders. Simplex is one of only three SWIFT Service Partners in the UK, Ireland and Nordic territories and runs a SWIFT Service Bureau providing outsourced connectivity to the SWIFT Network and other value-added services. Simplexs customer base includes a number of the worlds leading financial institutions as well as asset managers, hedge funds and large corporations. Simplex Consulting Ltd. is one of Europes leading financial technology consultancies focusing on business change, systems implementation and STP within the Banking, Securities and corporate treasury marketplaces. Simplex was established in 1997 to provide a high quality systems implementation service focusing on the middleware and evolving STP and exception based processing requirements of financial institutions. Simplex is an accredited SWIFT Service Partner, and operates a SWIFT Service Bureau, offering an outsourced SWIFTNet connectivity service, and a range of value added outsourced applications. Although not incorporated by reference to this filing, further information regarding Simplex can be found at www.simplexconsulting.com and further information about us can be found at www.capitalmarketstech.com . The Simplex transaction will represent an integral part of our business strategy. Simplex has been in the financial technology consulting business for a decade and has a deep understanding of the European financial technology markets. Simplexs domain expertise combined with CMTs aggressive expansion plans and financing strengths will allow both parties to focus on their respective expertise to realize a common goal in Europe. 15 Table of Contents On September 28, 2007 the Company acquired 55% of iBase Solutions Limited, a private company incorporated in England. The Company paid $2,268 for the common shares. The minority shareholders are individuals residing in England. iBases principal product is software which provides a pay-as-you-go service which automates interest and dividend claims between financial institutions and their counter parties. Principal target markets are key financial centres. The Company will be pursuing global custodian banks and their asset management and hedge fund clients. The service is asp-enabled and sits on top of a swift service bureau belonging to a prospective acquisition target of Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. On November 19, 2007 CMT announced that it had acquired a 55% equity stake in iBase Solutions Limited iBase, is a UK based financial solutions company specializing in optimizing post-trade processes for financial institutions. iBase is set to launch in May 2008 a suite of software products and services designed to replace inefficient and costly manual processes inherent in todays marketplace in Europe. The iBase products are designed to also assist companies in complying with the changes contemplated under MiFID and SEPA, which are to be enforced regulation by the European Commission. The product naturally links to Simplexs SWIFT Bureau to form a complete solution to this market issue. The product is currently scheduled to be finished in May 2008 when it will be presented to the International Securities Association for International Trade Communication (ISITC) sub-committee for claims. The ultimate ambition for iBase is for it to be recognized as the industry standard for claims processing in a similar fashion to SWIFT, which has been following the progress of iBase. Under both the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), legal requirements for transparency throughout the entire financial transaction lifecycle are set to be introduced. iBases products will target a number of the most inefficient processes within back office operations, currently handled by expensive and operationally risky manual processes. iBase will be working closely with London-based Simplex, which specializes in providing outsourced payments and post-trade processing services and which CMT has also entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire. Simplex already has a number of the worlds leading financial institutions using its outsourced solutions. iBase will further enhance the functionality of Simplexs existing offer, allowing for cross-selling opportunities to new and existing customers and will bring significant additional reconciliations. Companys principal products, services and intended markets . Our principal product is software which provides a pay-as-you-go service which automates interest and dividend claims between financial institutions and their counter parties. Our principal target markets are key financial centers. Management is initially focusing on global custodian banks and their asset management and hedge fund clients as primary clients. Our service is asp-enabled and sits on top of a swift service bureau belonging to a prospective CMT acquisition target. Management believes that the only realistic competitor to iBase would be SWIFTitself although management consider SWIFT as not a true competitor with our business. Dividend and interest claims are handled today by manual processes which are costly and risky. ibases industry position is that we believe it is considered by the key industry standards group, ISITC, as ideally positioned to solve the industry problem. We can market our service either directly or as a white-label service. We also presume governmental authorities will support our services as we enhance transparency on the post-trade arena, a feature supported by most regulatory authorities. On December 17, 2007, CMT announced that it signed a letter of intent to acquire UK-based Strike IT Services, (Strike IT) an IT consulting firm in the corporate treasury and financial applications market. The proposed acquisition will bring a formidable team of additional resources to CMT as well as strong management. CMT and its subsidiaries will benefit from the cost savings associated with rationalization and an enhanced sales force. In addition it is expected that MiFID and SEPA resourcing requirements will provide a solid foundation of business for CMT in both consulting and solutions divisions during the coming years. Strike IT Services is an IT consultancy and recruitment company which has a number of corporate customers for whom it provides resources around SAP (SAP is the worlds largest business software company) and the treasury operations. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) operates a worldwide financial messaging network. On this network messages are guaranteed by SWIFT to be securely and reliably exchanged between banks and other financial institutions. SWIFT also markets software and services to financial institutions, much of it for use on the SWIFTNet Network. The majority of international interbank messages use the SWIFT network. As of April 2006 SWIFT linked almost 8,000 financial institutions in 205 countries. SWIFT does not facilitate funds transferfinancial institutions need a corresponding banking relationship for financial transactions. SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law and it is owned by its member financial institutions. SWIFT headquarters are located in La Hulpe, Belgium. In addition, Strike IT is planning to open an office in a location to be determined by management in 2 nd quarter 2008 to tap into the increasing opportunities in the financial resourcing sector presented by MiFID and SEPA. 16 Table of Contents A further bonus to this acquisition is that it will allow Simplex to separate its consulting activities from its solutions business. This will resolve a recent market issue that has questioned Simplexs consulting objectivity since it currently runs directly alongside a growing solutions business. We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership, or other similar proceeding. EMPLOYEES We currently have no employees. Management presently serves in an uncompensated role. The Companys controlled subsidiary, iBase Solutions Limited, pays the director a salary for services performed. SEASONALITY There is no seasonal aspect to our business. 17 Table of Contents FACILITIES The Companys corporate office is currently located 340 E. Randolph Street, Suite 2701, Chicago IL 60610. These facilities are owned by R & E Management, a company owned by Hagop Bouroudjian, Chairman of our board. Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. (CMT) has a month to month lease with R&E Management for its 2200 square foot location at a cost of $6,500 per month. iBase Solutions Limited rents office space from Simplex Consulting Limited at Cheyne House, Crown Court, 62/63 Cheapside, London, EC2V 6JP at a cost of £2000 on a month to month basis.

On November 15, 2007 CMT has executed a definitive share purchase agreement with Simplex Solutions Inc., to acquire 100% of the outstanding common shares of its wholly owned UK subsidiary, Simplex Consulting Limited in exchange for 5,000,000 common shares of CMT. On April 29, 2008 Simplex Solutions Inc., called a shareholder meeting to vote on approval of this transaction. CMT anticipates closing this transaction shortly thereafter given shareholder approval. On December 17, 2007 the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with Strike IT Services Limited, a private company incorporated and registered in England and Wales, to purchase 100% of their outstanding common shares. Strike IT will become a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The terms are as follows: $202,180 (£100,000) payable immediately, the balance of £100,000 is to be paid on closing of the transaction.

The final payment of $204,186 (£100,000) was paid on March 18, 2008. Upon completion of Strike IT audits this transaction will be closed. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY We operate from 2200 square feet of leased offices located at 340 E. Randolph Street, Suite 2701, Chicago, IL 60610. We do not hold any material investments in other real or personal property other than office equipment.

We have a month-to-month lease for office space, which is owned by R&E Management, which is owned by our chairman, Hagop Bouroudjian. The lease is payable monthly, at $6,500 per month. 18 Table of Contents Our subsidiary, iBase Solutions Limited, rents office space from Simplex Consulting Limited at Cheyne House, Crown Court, 62/63 Cheapside, London, EC2V 6JP at a cost of £2000 on a month to month basis.

Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding securities, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive, when and if declared by the board of directors, out of funds legally available for such purpose, any dividends on a pro rata basis. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. The common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable, and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants or conversion of notes that are being registered in this prospectus will, when the warrants or note are properly exercised, be fully paid and non-assessable. Preferred Stock Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to determine all of the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock. As of the date of this prospectus, other than as outlined below, the Company does not have any preferred stock issued or outstanding.

Our Bylaws also permit it to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in such capacity, regardless of whether the Bylaws would permit indemnification. We believe that the provisions in its Articles of Incorporation and its Bylaws are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as officers and directors. 23 Table of Contents Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the 1933 Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of Company pursuant to the foregoing, or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. Anti-Takeover Effects Of Provisions of The Articles Of Incorporation Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include a number of provisions which may have the effect of discouraging persons from pursuing non-negotiated takeover attempts.

F.S. 607.0850(3) Such act also provides that the corporation may indemnify an officer or director, advance expenses, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to a criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. F.S. 607.0850(1)(2). A court may order indemnification of an officer or director if it determines that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to such indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances. F.S.607.0850(9). No pending material litigation or proceeding involving our directors, executive officers, employees or other agents as to which indemnification is being sought exists, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened material litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any of our directors or executive officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed hereby in the Securities Act and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. and subsidiary (development stage company) at December 31, 2007 and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the period June 29, 1995 (date of inception) to December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness for the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the over all financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiary at December 31, 2007 and the consolidated statements of operations, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the period June 29, 1995 (date of inception) to December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company will need additional working capital for its planned activity and to service its debt, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in the notes to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Salt Lake City, Utah April 14, 2008 /s/ Madsen & Associates, CPAs Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 1. ORGANIZATION The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on June 29, 1995 with the name ARLN Realty Associates, Inc @ with authorized common shares of 7,500 with a par value of $1.00. The Company had several name changes and authorized common share changes and on September 14, 2006 changed its name to AFintech Group, Inc.@ and changed its authorized common shares to 250,000,000 at a par value of $.001 and added authorized preferred shares of 10,000,000 at par value of $.001. On February 7, 2007 the name was changed to ACapital Markets Technologies, Inc.@ The terms of the preferred shares were determined by the Board of Directors in April 2007. The shares were designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at 1 for 2.5 Common shares. Each preferred share issued has 2.5 votes on all matters presented to be voted by the holders of common stock. The shares are convertible at the option of the Holder at any time from and after the Original Issue Date. As of the date of the financial statement there have been no preferred shares issued. The principal business activity of the corporation was the development of an e-commerce web site and an e-commerce virtual department store.

The Company is a development stage company. After 2001 the Company has been engaged in seeking viable business opportunities in the financial services sector. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Methods The Company recognizes income and expenses based on the accrual method of accounting. Dividend Policy The Company has not adopted a policy regarding payment of dividends. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect, when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized, when it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized. F-7 Table of Contents CAPITAL MARKETS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) On December 31, 2007, the Company had a net operating loss for carry forward of approximately $13,347,202. Any income tax benefit has not been determined as there has been a substantial change in stockholders. The net operating loss will expire in 2028. Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments are considered by management to be their estimated fair values due to their short term maturities. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of shares actually outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding as if shares had been issued on the exercise of any preferred share rights unless the exercise becomes antidilutive and then only the basic per share amounts are shown in the report. Concentration of Credit Risk There are no financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risks. Revenue Recognition Revenue will be recognized on the sale and delivery of a product or the completion of services provided. Advertising and Market Development The company expenses advertising and market development costs as incurred. Estimates and Assumptions Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements. F-8 Table of Contents CAPITAL MARKETS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company does not expect that the adoption of other recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements. 3. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE The Statute of Limitations has run on a substantial part of the accounts payable. 4. SUBSIDIARY On September 28, 2007 the Company acquired 55% of iBase Solutions Limited, a private company incorporated in England. The Company paid $2,268 for the common shares.

AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 6. SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES An officer controls a company that owns the property which the Company leases it office space from. The terms of the lease are $6,500 per month and the lease is month to month with no deposit paid. The Company has incurred promotional expenses of $155,475 with an affiliate company of which $79,220 is still due and payable at December 31, 2007. 7. GOING CONCERN The Company does not have the necessary working capital to service its debt and for its planned activity, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional working capital and the management of the Company has developed a strategy, which it believes will accomplish this objective through settlement of its debt by the issuance of common shares, loans from related parties, and equity funding which will enable the Company to conduct operations for the coming year. 8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent to December 31, 2007 the Company has issued 1,766,668 units in a private placement for $1,725,000. Each unit consists of one share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and one Common Stock Purchase Warrant. The Common Stock Purchase Warrants may be redeemed for one additional share of common stock at a price of $1.50 per share, beginning two years from date of purchase. The warrants have been determined to have no value at the issuance. On December 17, 2007 the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with Strike IT Services Limited, a private company incorporated and registered in England and Wales, to purchase 100% of their outstanding common shares. Strike IT will become a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS March 31, 2008 (unaudited) 1. ORGANIZATION The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on June 29, 1995 with the name RLN Realty Associates, Inc. with authorized common shares of 7,500 with a par value of $1.00. The Company had several name changes and authorized common share changes and on September 14, 2006 changed its name to Fintech Group, Inc. and changed its authorized common shares to 250,000,000 at a par value of $.001 and added authorized preferred shares of 10,000,000 at par value of $.001. On February 7, 2007, the name was changed to Capital Markets Technologies, Inc. The terms of the preferred shares were determined by the Board of Directors in April 2007. The shares were designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a conversion ratio of 1 for 2.5 Common shares. Each preferred share issued has 2.5 votes on all matters presented to be voted by the holders of common stock. The shares are convertible at the option of the Holder at any time from and after the Original Issue Date. The principal business activity of the corporation was the development of an e-commerce web site and an e-commerce virtual department store. During 2001 the activity was discontinued and its remaining assets and related liabilities were transferred and the Company has remained inactive since that date. The Company is a development stage company. After 2001 the Company has been engaged in seeking viable business opportunities in the financial services sector. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Methods The Company recognizes income and expenses based on the accrual method of accounting. Dividend Policy The Company has not adopted a policy regarding payment of dividends. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect, when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized, when it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized. F-19 Table of Contents CAPITAL MARKETS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS March 31, 2008 (unaudited) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) On March 31, 2008, the Company had a net operating loss for carry forward of approximately $13,786,031. Any income tax benefit has not been determined as there has been a substantial change in stockholders. The net operating loss will expire in 2028. Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments are considered by management to be their estimated fair values due to their short term maturities. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of shares actually outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding as if shares had been issued on the exercise of any preferred share rights unless the exercise becomes antidilutive and then only the basic per share amounts are shown in the report. Concentration of Credit Risk There are no financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risks. Revenue Recognition Revenue will be recognized on the sale and delivery of a product or the completion of services provided. Advertising and Market Development The company expenses advertising and market development costs as incurred. Estimates and Assumptions Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements. F-20 Table of Contents CAPITAL MARKETS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

This prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities other than the securities offered by this prospectus or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities in any jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation in such jurisdiction. The delivery of this prospectus shall not, under any circumstances, create any implication that there have been no changes in the affairs of the company since the date of this prospectus.

Table of Contents PART II INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The Florida Business Corporation Act provides that a person who is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of an action because of service as an officer or director or a corporation, such person is entitled to indemnification of expenses actually and reasonably incurred in such defense. F.S. 607.0850(3) Such act also provides that the corporation may indemnify an officer or director, advance expenses, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to a criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. F.S. 607.0850(1)(2). A court may order indemnification of an officer or director if it determines that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to such indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances. F.S.607.0850(9). No pending material litigation or proceeding involving our directors, executive officers, employees or other agents as to which indemnification is being sought exists, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened material litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any of our directors or executive officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed hereby in the Securities Act and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement. iii. To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; 2. That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 3. To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 4. That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: i. If the registrant is relying on Rule 430B (230.430B of this chapter): A. Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and B. Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date; or II-4 Table of Contents ii. If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 5. That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: i. Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; ii. registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; iii. The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and iv. Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the 1933 Act may be permitted to our director, officer and controlling persons of the small business issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the small business issuer has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the small business issuer of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the small business issuer in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the small business issuer will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act, and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
