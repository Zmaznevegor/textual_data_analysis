Individuals who participate in this offering are urged to read this entire prospectus carefully. An investment in the units offered hereby involves a high degree of risk. This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the projected results discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors. We, our, ours, or us, when used herein, refer to Vicor Technologies, Inc., including subsidiaries and predecessors, except where it is clear that the term refers only to Vicor Technologies, Inc. Overview Our Business We are a medical diagnostics company, originally incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 24, 2005 as SRKP 6, Inc., focused on commercializing noninvasive diagnostic technology products based on our patented, proprietary point correlation dimension algorithm (the PD2i ® Algorithm). The PD2i ® Algorithm and software facilitates the ability to accurately risk stratify a specific target population to predict future pathological events, such as cardiac death (which includes arrhythmic death and congestive heart failure death), imminent death from trauma and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We believe that the PD2i ® Algorithm and software represents a noninvasive monitoring technology that physicians and other members of the medical community can use as a new and accurate vital sign. We are currently commercializing two proprietary diagnostic medical products which employ software utilizing the PD2i ® Algorithim: the PD2i Analyzer tm (sometimes referred to as the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm ) and the PD2i- VS TM (Vital Sign). It is also anticipated that the PD2i ® Algorithm and software applications will allow for the early detection of Alzheimers Disease and other disorders and diseases. Our first product, the PD2i Analyzer tm , received 510(k) marketing clearance from the Food and Drug Administration or FDA on December 29, 2008. It displays and analyzes electrocardiographic (ECG) information and measures heart rate variability, or HRV, in patients at rest and in response to controlled exercise and paced respiration. The PD2i Analyzer tm applies patented and proprietary technology to analyze a high resolution electrocardiograph (ECG) signal, and measure R-wave intervals. The clinical significance of HRV and other parameters must be determined by a physician. We commenced sales of the PD2i Analyzer tm in January 2010. We also entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with VF Medical, LLC, a medical products distribution company which we refer to as VF Medical, for South Carolina, North Carolina, and the cities of Savannah and Augusta, Georgia. VF Medical will utilize a 25-person medical products distribution team consisting of agents who have long-term relationships with cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and family practice and internal medicine physicians within the designated territory. We are seeking other distributors and have begun hiring sales personnel in selected geographic areas. The PD2i Analyzer tm consists of a private-label digital electrocardiograph device that incorporates automated blood pressure recording and a laptop computer which utilizes proprietary collection software. The PD2i Analyzer tm accesses the internet and sends recorded electrocardiograph files to our remote server where the files are analyzed by our proprietary algorithm and software. The analyzed results are then provided to the physician in an electronic health record together with a report and information which the physician can use to bill both public and private insurers utilizing established Current Procedural Terminology Codes, known as CPT Codes. Vicor bills the physician monthly for the number of tests performed, thus enabling us to realize revenue from the recurring use of the PD2i Analyzer tm in addition to revenue realized from the sale of the device. We anticipate making various submissions to the FDA for marketing clearance for the PD2i Analyzer tm for additional medical claims related to cardiology, imminent death from trauma and possibly the diagnosis of diseases related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Approval from the FDA would allow us to expand and accelerate our marketing efforts. 1 Table of Contents SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA Because this is only a summary of our financial information, it does not contain all of the financial information that may be important to you. Therefore, you should carefully read all of the information in this prospectus, including the financial statements and their explanatory notes and the section entitled, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, before making a decision to invest in the units. The consolidated statement of operations data for the two years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. The consolidated statement of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the period from August 4, 2000 (inception) to March 31, 2010 and consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2010 and 2009 is derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Period from August 4, 2000 Three Months Ended (Inception) Years Ended December 31, March 31, to March 31, 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 Statement of Operations Data: Revenues $  $  $ 100,000 $  $ 944,000 Operating expenses 7,321,000 6,727,000 2,056,000 852,000 55,571,000 Net loss (5,164,000 ) (6,727,000 ) (2,073,000 ) (1,146,000 ) (52,587,000 ) Balance Sheet Data: Cash $ 544,000 $ 182,000 $ 308,000 $ 268,000  Total assets 1,048,000 476,000 946,000 589,000  Total liabilities 7,658,000 2,434,000 8,900,000 5,730,000  Net capital deficiency (6,610,000 ) (1,958,000 ) (7,954,000 ) (1,951,000 )  Recent Developments On May 19, 2010, we announced the initial results of a study designed to analyze data from the Merte Subita en Insufficiencia Cardiaca (MUSIC) Trial using our PD2i ® algorithm and software. The study, titled Prognostic Significance of Point Correlation Dimension Algorithm (PD2i) in Chronic Heart Failure, was conducted under a collaborative agreement with the University of Rochester and the Catalan Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences in Barcelona. The goal of the study was to evaluate the ability of our PD2i ® nonlinear algorithm to predict cardiac events in the 537 chronic heart failure patients enrolled in the MUSIC Trial. MUSIC Trial participants were followed for an average period of 44 months. The conclusion of the University of Rochester researchers who conducted the study is that the PD2i ® nonlinear algorithm and software is predictive of total mortality, cardiac death, and heart failure death in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 35%, which refers to the percentage of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heart beat. With a P value of 0.004 the study results are highly statistically significant. Researchers from the University of Rochester and our scientists are studying these initial results to determine whether the resulting data will support a 510(k) submission to the FDA for a marketing claim. We believe that the results from this trial may broaden the market for the PD2i Analyzer tm as a diagnostic tool that will significantly contribute to cardiologists in their assessment of treatment options for heart failure patients.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, and all information contained in this prospectus, before you decide whether to purchase our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us that we currently do not deem material may also become important factors that may materially and adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of the following risks could cause our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects to materially suffer and the market price of our stock to decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment . Risks related to our business We have incurred significant operating losses since inception that raise doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have a history of operating losses. We are a developmental stage company that is still in the process of developing new and unproved technologies. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception, including net losses of approximately $7.3 million in 2002, $9.2 million in 2003, $3.4 million in 2004, $4.2 million in 2005, $4.6 million in 2006, $6.1 million in 2007, $8.5 million in 2008, $6.6 million in 2009 and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. As of March 31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $55.9 million. The extent of our future operating losses and the timing of our profitability are highly uncertain, and we may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability. Based on funds available to us as of December 31, 2009 our independent auditors expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern if we are unable to raise additional funds. If we are unable to successfully implement our financing strategy and develop commercially successful products, we will not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability and may be forced to cease operations. We are a development stage company and we may be unable to successfully commercialize any products. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies engaged in the development and commercialization of new technologies, particularly companies targeting markets characterized by complex regulatory issues. In particular, medical devices, such as the PD2i Analyzer tm , require CPT codes and agreed-upon reimbursement levels in order to achieve widespread physician use and drive significant revenue. While established CPT codes with adequate levels of reimbursement exist, we still may not generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability because our products may not be accepted in the marketplace. Our limited operating history in new product areas makes the prediction of future results of operations extremely difficult. We have never generated, and we may never generate, positive operating cash flow. Our business operations do not generate positive cash flow and we do not currently receive revenues from other sources, such as licensing fees, revenues from grants or consulting fees. Depending upon the extent of revenue derived from these sources, if any, as well as revenues generated from the sale of the PD2i Analyzer tm and related test fees, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses. We cannot predict or guarantee when our products will generate sufficient revenue to achieve positive operating cash flow. Our cash position is very low relative to our anticipated cash needs. As of March 31, 2010 we had a cash balance of approximately $308,000. This is substantially less than our projected short-term cash requirements (including fixed costs and projected future costs). There can be no guaranty that we can raise additional funds from sales of our equity or debt securities on terms that are acceptable to us or otherwise generate sufficient revenue to maintain our operations. Our inability to obtain such funds would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and operations. 4 Table of Contents We may be unable to obtain additional funds necessary to sustain our business on acceptable terms or at all, which would harm our business and may require us to significantly curtail or cease our operations. We need substantial capital to fund our business operations and finance our working capital requirements for the long-term. We have experienced significant negative cash flow from operations to date and expect to continue to experience significant negative cash flow in the future. We need additional funds to sustain and expand our research and development activities, our collaborative arrangements and commence our sales and marketing activities. Adequate funds for these and other purposes on acceptable terms, whether through additional equity financing, debt financing or other sources, may not be available when needed, or may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders. Our inability to obtain sufficient funds from operations and external sources will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to raise additional funds, we will be forced to significantly curtail or cease our operations. Our ability to issue debt securities or to service any debt may also be limited by our inability to generate cash flow. We are developing and attempting to commercialize new and unproven technologies. We primarily work with and develop new technologies that have not been proven for commercial application. The validation of these technologies for commercial application will require substantial additional capital investment and a significant amount of work. Additionally, many of the products and services that we contemplate developing may prove unsuitable for commercial application. We cannot be certain that any such products or services will be able to be commercialized and sold successfully, or at all. The results of clinical studies may not support the usefulness of our technology. Conducting clinical trials is a long, expensive and uncertain process that is subject to delays and failure at any stage. Clinical trials can take months or years. The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, (1) the FDA may not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or may place a clinical trial on hold; (2) subjects may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect and subjects may not be followed up at the rate we expect; (3) subjects may experience events unrelated to our products; (4) third-party clinical investigators may not perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations may not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; (5) interim results of any of our clinical trials may be inconclusive or negative; (6) regulatory inspections of our clinical trials may require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate them if investigators find us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements; or (7) governmental regulations or administrative actions may change and impose new requirements, particularly on reimbursement. Results of pre-clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results and previous clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent medical trials. We may experience delays, cost overruns and project terminations despite achieving promising results in pre-clinical testing or early clinical testing. In addition, the data obtained from clinical trials may be inadequate to support approval or clearance of a submission. The FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our clinical trials, or may find the clinical trial design, conduct or results inadequate to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which could further delay approval of our products. If we are unsuccessful in receiving FDA approval of a product, we would not be able to sell or promote the product in the United States, which could seriously harm our business. Moreover, we face similar risks in other jurisdictions in which we may sell or propose to sell our products. If third-party contract research organizations do not perform their responsibilities in an acceptable and timely manner, our pre-clinical testing or clinical trials could be delayed or prove unsuccessful. We do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of pre-clinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We rely and will continue to rely on clinical investigators, third-party contract research organizations and consultants to perform some or all of the functions associated with pre-clinical testing or clinical trials. The failure of any of these vendors to perform in an acceptable and timely manner in the future, including in accordance with any applicable regulatory 5 Table of Contents requirements, such as good clinical and laboratory practices, or pre-clinical testing or clinical trial protocols, could cause a delay or otherwise adversely affect our pre-clinical testing or clinical trials and, ultimately, the timely advancement of our development programs. Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we were to lose the services of our key personnel, or if we were unable to recruit key personnel in the future. Our success will depend to a significant extent on the skills and efforts of David H. Fater, Dr. Jerry M. Anchin, Dr. James Skinner, Dr. Daniel Weiss and Lloyd Chesney. We have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Fater and Chesney and Drs. Anchin, Skinner and Weiss. Nevertheless, employment agreements do not assure the services of such personnel. Despite employment and noncompetition agreements, our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees in the future. Competition for such personnel is intense and we will compete for qualified personnel with numerous other employers, many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, we may incur significantly increased costs in order to attract and retain skilled employees. The loss of one or more key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to evolving and expensive corporate governance regulations and requirements. Our failure to adequately adhere to these requirements or the failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could seriously harm our business. As a publicly traded company, we are subject to certain federal, state and other rules and regulations, including applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Compliance with these evolving regulations is costly and requires a significant diversion of management time and attention, particularly with regard to disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Although we have reviewed our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures in order to determine whether they are effective, our controls and procedures may be unable to prevent errors or frauds in the future. Faulty judgments, simple errors or mistakes, or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established controls and procedures, make it difficult for us to ensure that their objectives are met. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect material errors or fraud, could seriously harm our business and results of operations. We are subject to risks in connection with the impact of changes in international, national and local economic and market conditions. Our business is subject to risks in connection with the impact of changes in international, national and local economic and market conditions. Beyond the risks of doing business internationally, there is also the potential impact of changes in the international, national and local economic and market conditions, including the effects of a global financial or credit crisis, and the effects of terrorist acts and the war on terrorism, which could impact customers ability to pay for our products. If we sell our products in international markets, we will experience additional risks associated with these sales, which include:  political and economic instability;  export controls;  changes in legal and regulatory requirements;  United States and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products; and  changes in tax laws and tariffs. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may choose to sell our products in international markets through independent distributors. If a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor. If a change in our distributors becomes necessary, we may experience increased costs, as well as a substantial disruption in operations and a resulting loss of revenue. 6 Table of Contents Risks Related To Regulatory Matters The medical device and pharmaceutical industries are subject to stringent regulation and failure to obtain regulatory approval will prevent commercialization of our products. Our Diagnostic Platform. Our PD2i Analyzer tm received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA on December 29, 2008. This clearance enables us to market this product and generate revenue. Our products for specific medical claims, however, can only be directly marketed to physicians by submitting additional 510(k) applications to the FDA supported by satisfactory clinical trial results. However, the results of our clinical trials may not provide sufficient evidence to allow the FDA to grant us such additional marketing clearances. The failure to obtain FDA marketing clearance for these specific medical claims would have a material adverse effect on our business. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDCA and associated regulations, manufacturers of medical devices must comply with certain regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of medical devices. In addition, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States, and the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market evaluation programs. The process of obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA for new products could take a significant period of time, require the expenditure of substantial resources, involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, require changes to the products and result in limitations on the indicated uses of the product. Our Drug Platform. None of our drug product candidates have been approved by any governmental regulatory agency, including the FDA. Our research, development, pre-clinical and, to the extent that we undertake the New Drug Application process (NDA) itself, clinical trial activities, are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for drugs is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and any regulatory approvals may contain limitations on the indicated usage of a drug, distribution restrictions or may be conditioned on burdensome post-approval study or other requirements, including the requirement that we or our pharmaceutical licensees institute and follow a special risk management plan to monitor and manage potential safety issues, all of which may eliminate or reduce the drugs market potential. Post-market evaluation of a product could result in marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market. Any or all of our drug product candidates may not receive FDA approval, even if we resume research and development activities. If we seek to market our products in foreign jurisdictions, we may need to obtain regulatory approval in these jurisdictions. In order to market our products in the European Union and many other foreign jurisdictions, we may need to obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. Approval procedures vary among countries (except with respect to the countries that are part of the European Economic Area) and can involve additional clinical testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Should we decide to market our products abroad, we may fail to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. We may be unable to file for, and may not receive, necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize our products in any foreign market, which could adversely affect our business prospects. Changes in healthcare reimbursement systems in the U.S. and abroad could affect our revenues and profitability. The Federal government is considering ways to change, and has changed, the manner in which healthcare services are provided and paid for in the U.S. Occasionally, the U.S. Congress passes laws that impact reimbursement for healthcare services, including reimbursement to hospitals and physicians. States may also enact 7 Table of Contents legislation that impacts Medicaid payments to hospitals and physicians. In addition, Centers For Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, establishes payment levels for hospitals and physicians on an annual basis, which can increase or decrease payments to such entities. In particular, the recently passed health care reform legislation and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (also known as the Stimulus Package) affects funding for and in many instances regulates healthcare treatment and strategies. It is unclear what effect, if any, these pieces of legislation or any other future legislation would have on our business. Internationally, medical reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to country, with some countries limiting medical centers spending through fixed budgets, regardless of levels of patients and treatment, and other countries requiring application for, and approval of, government or third-party reimbursement. Even if we succeed in bringing our products to market, uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities and at profitable prices. If we promote the off-label use of the PD2i Analyzer TM , we could be subject to fines and penalties from the FDA or other regulatory agencies. If the FDA or another regulatory agency determines that we have promoted off-label use of our products, we may be subject to various penalties, including civil and/or criminal penalties. The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. If the FDA or another regulatory agency determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-labeled promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. We must comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws, and we could face substantial penalties for non-compliance and be excluded from government healthcare programs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is regulated by laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including:  the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for, a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; and  state law equivalents to the Anti-Kickback Statute, which may not be limited to government-reimbursed items. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or similar laws or regulations, we or our officers may face significant civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment and exclusions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any violations may lead to curtailment or restructuring of our operations which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of being found in violation of these laws, is increased by the fact that many of these laws are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our managements attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation. If enforcement action were to occur, our reputation and our business and financial condition may be harmed, even if we were to prevail or settle the action. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found not to comply with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on our business. 8 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Market for Our Products Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue will depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. It is possible that no further patents will be issued for our potential applications and that any issued patent, may not provide any competitive advantage to us or will be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future. In addition, our competitors, many of which have substantial resources and have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to protect in part through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Such measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets or proprietary technology may become known or be independently developed by competitors. Our failure to protect our proprietary technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future litigation over intellectual property rights would likely involve significant expense on our part and distract our management. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing on the rights of others and our ability to enforce our own intellectual property rights. Litigation or claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although there are no pending lawsuits against us regarding our technology or notices that we are infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, litigation or infringement claims may arise in the future. The success of our various products will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate levels of third-party reimbursement for our products. Our ability to sell our various products will depend on our ability to maintain adequate levels of third-party reimbursement for use of these products by our customers. The amount of reimbursement in the United States that is available for clinical use of these products is expected to vary. In the United States, the cost of medical care is funded in substantial part by government insurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and by private and corporate health care plans. Third-party payors may seek to deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed device is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payors, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Difficulties in obtaining reimbursement for each of our products, or the inadequacy of the reimbursement obtained could materially decrease any demand for our products. The commercial viability of our products is uncertain. To date we have sold only a limited number of one of our products. It is therefore possible that products developed by us may not achieve widespread market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors, including the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals and the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products and their advantages over existing technologies, as well as approved reimbursement for physicians. We may be unable to successfully manufacture and market our products even if they perform successfully in clinical applications. Furthermore, physicians and the medical community in general may not accept and utilize any products that we develop. We will depend on third parties to manufacture our products and the unavailability of qualified manufacturers could restrict our ability to obtain and sell our products. We do not manufacture our products and we anticipate that we will not manufacture any of our products at any time. Products will be manufactured by either unrelated parties or strategic partners. We may be unable to locate a 9 Table of Contents suitable source to manufacture our products, and even if one is found, we will be dependent upon its performance. Delays in the manufacture of our products or defects arising from manufacturing could have a material adverse effect on our business. We will depend on third parties to market and sell our products. We do not plan on establishing a large in-house sales force and we intend to primarily enter into co-marketing, sales and/or licensing agreements with medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to take advantage of their marketing and sales expertise and to utilize their personnel. Accordingly, we may become dependent on the efforts of others to obtain widespread acceptance of our products. No assurances can be given that such parties will perform satisfactorily. We may be unable to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the biotechnology/medical device industry and as a result, our technologies may become obsolete. The field of biotechnology/medical devices is characterized by significant and extremely rapid technological change. Companies with significantly greater resources than us may compete with our technology and products. Research and discoveries by others may result in medical insights or breakthroughs, which may render our technologies obsolete even before they generate any revenue. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Product liability claims may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that is made with the use of any of our technologies causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable. We currently have limited product liability insurance that may not fully cover our potential liabilities. If we attempt to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage, this additional insurance may be prohibitively expensive, or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products developed by us or our collaborative partners. Any adverse judgments against us which exceed our insurance coverage would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We face competition in the market for diagnostic devices, including from substantially larger companies with greater resources, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products quicker or more successfully than us. Although our direct competition in the area of noninvasive diagnostic tools for cardiology and the autonomic nervous system is currently limited, we face competition from companies who develop medical devices or screening tests that diagnose cardiac disease and this competition is likely to increase. Our success will depend on our ability to establish and maintain a market for our products as well as keep pace with technological changes affecting our industry. Many of our current as well as prospective competitors have substantially greater capital resources, name recognition, research and development, regulatory, manufacturing and marketing capabilities which may lead to their discovering, developing or commercializing competing products faster or more effectively than us. Many of these competitors offer broad, well-established product lines and ancillary services not offered by us. Some of our competitors or prospective competitors also enjoy long-term or preferential supply arrangements with physicians and hospitals which may act as a barrier to our market entry. Risks Related to our Common Stock The trading of our common stock on the OTCBB and the designation of our common stock as a penny stock could impact the trading market for our common stock. Our securities, traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTC Bulletin Board), are subject to SEC rules that impose special sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers or accredited investors. For the purposes of the rule, the phrase accredited investors 10 Table of Contents means, in general terms, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or having an annual income that exceeds $200,000 (or that exceeds $300,000 when combined with a spouses income). For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction before the sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and also may affect the ability of purchasers to sell their securities in any market that might develop. In addition, the SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate penny stock that restrict transactions involving these securities, including Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, including the NASDAQ Stock Exchange) if current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange. Because our common stock may constitute penny stock within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and to our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, stockholders may find it more difficult to sell their securities. Stockholders should be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker- dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses. Our shares of common stock are thinly traded, and the price may not reflect our value; there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares now or in the future. We have a trading symbol for our common stock (VCRT.OB), which permits our shares to be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB), which is a quotation medium for subscribing members, not an issuer listing service. However, our shares of common stock are thinly traded, and the price, if traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed or greatly reduce the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of common stock as collateral for any loans. Substantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock or the public market perceives that stockholders might sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems appropriate. As of May 25, 2010 we have outstanding 45,552,834 shares of common stock and we are required to issue additional shares upon (i) the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, and (ii) the conversion of outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B Junior Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock, 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes and the 12% Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock, which could exceed 25,000,000 shares depending upon the price of our common stock. 11 Table of Contents We do not pay cash dividends to our stockholders and have no plans to pay cash dividends in the future. We plan to retain earnings, if any, to finance future growth and have no plans to pay cash dividends to stockholders. Because we do not pay cash dividends, holders of our securities will experience a gain on their investment in our securities only in the case of an appreciation of value of our securities. Our officers, directors and principal stockholders controlling approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock can exert significant influence over us and may make decisions that are not in the best interests of all stockholders. Our officers, directors and principal stockholders (greater than 5% stockholders) collectively control approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock, exclusive of outstanding options and warrants. As a result, these stockholders will be able to affect the outcome of or exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control. In particular, this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company. This in turn could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and, accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider. Anti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could negatively affect our stock price. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. The combination of these provisions, as well as Delaware law, effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The market of our common stock could vary significantly based on market perceptions of the status of our development efforts. The perception of the investing public and securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock price. As a result, the market price of our common stock has and could in the future change substantially when we or our competitors make product announcements. Many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond our control. Risks Related to this Offering Our management team will have immediate and broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. There is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to closing this offering and therefore net proceeds from this offering will be immediately available to our management to use at their discretion. We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including our working capital needs. Their judgments may not result in positive returns on your investment and you will not have an opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other information upon which our management bases its decisions. You will experience immediate and substantial dilution as a result of this offering and may experience additional dilution in the future. You will incur immediate and substantial dilution as a result of this offering. After giving effect to the sale by us of up to units offered in this offering at a public offering price of $ per unit, and after deducting the placement agency fees and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, investors in this offering 12 Table of Contents can expect an immediate dilution of $ per share, or %, at the public offering price, assuming no exercise of the warrants. In addition, in the past, we issued options and warrants to acquire shares of common stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B Junior Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock, 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes and the 12% Convertible Notes which are convertible into shares of common stock. To the extent these options are ultimately exercised or the conversion right of these convertible securities is exercised, you may sustain future dilution. We may also acquire or license other technologies or finance strategic alliances by issuing equity, which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. There is no public market for the warrants to purchase common stock in this offering. There is no established public trading market for the warrants being offered in this offering, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply for listing the warrants on any securities exchange. Without an active market, the liquidity of the warrants will be limited. The offering may not be fully subscribed, and, even if the offering is fully subscribed, we may need additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may have to discontinue our operations entirely. The placement agents in this offering will offer the units on a reasonable best-efforts basis, meaning that we may raise substantially less than the total maximum offering amounts. No refund will be made available to investors if less than all of the units are sold. Further, during 2008, 2009 and the three months ended March 31, 2010, we used a significant amount of cash to finance the continued development of our products, and obtain regulatory approvals and clearances. If after this offering we still need significant additional financing, we may seek to raise such funds through, among other things, public and private equity offerings and debt financings. Any equity financings may be dilutive to existing stockholders, and any debt financings will likely involve covenants restricting our business activities. Finally, such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of units in this offering, assuming gross proceeds of $ million (which is the amount of gross proceeds received if the offering is fully subscribed), will be approximately $ million, after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated expenses of this offering. In addition, if all of the warrants included in the units offered pursuant to this prospectus are exercised in full for cash, we will receive approximately an additional $ million in cash. We may not be successful in selling any or all of the securities offered hereby. Because there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to closing in this offering, we may sell less than all of the securities offered hereby, which may significantly reduce the amount of proceeds received by us. In addition, the warrants included in the units offered pursuant to this prospectus may not be exercised at all, or if they are exercised, may be exercised on a cash-less basis. We expect to use any proceeds received from the offering for the following purposes: (i) the repayment of approximately $300,000 in bank debt, (ii) to increase staffing, including sales and marketing personnel, (iii) to build-up our inventory, and (iv) for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs. Our bank debt currently consists of unsecured loans of $200,000 and $100,000 made by Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) as the lender under a loan agreement. The $200,000 loan matures in January 2011 and bears interest at 3.54%, and the $100,000 loan matures in October 2010 and bears interest at 4.83%. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of this offering. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of any sale of the securities. We reserve the right to change the use of proceeds as a result of certain contingencies such as competitive developments, opportunities to acquire technologies or products and other factors. We may invest the net proceeds received from this offering temporarily until we use them for general corporate purposes. 13 Table of Contents DILUTION Our reported net tangible book value as of March 31, 2010 was $ , or $ per share of common stock, based upon shares outstanding as of that date. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing such number of outstanding shares of common stock into our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities. After giving effect to the sale of the units offered in this offering at the offering price of $ per unit, at March 31, 2010 (and excluding shares of common stock issued and any proceeds received upon exercise of the warrants), after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, and the mandatory conversion of the shares of Series B Junior Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock at a conversion price of $ per share, the 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $ per share and the 12% Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $ per share into shares of our common stock as a result of the offering, our net tangible book value at March 31, 2010 would have been approximately $ , or $ per share. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of approximately $ per share to our existing stockholders, and an immediate dilution of $ per share to investors purchasing units in the offering. The following table illustrates the per share dilution to investors purchasing units in the offering: Public offering price per unit Net tangible book value per share as of March 31, 2010 Increase per share attributable to sale of units to investors Increase per share attributable to mandatory conversion of Series B Junior Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock Increase per share attributable to mandatory conversion of 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes Increase per share attributable to mandatory conversion of the 12% Convertible Notes As adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering and mandatory conversions Dilution per share to investors Dilution as a percentage of the offering price The foregoing illustration does not reflect potential dilution from the exercise of outstanding options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, from the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and from the exercise of the warrants included in the offered units and the placement agent warrants. 14 Table of Contents MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol VCRT.OB since July 9, 2007. The market for our common stock is limited and volatile. The following table sets forth the range of high and low bid quotations for our common stock for each of the periods indicated as reported by the OTC Bulletin Board. The prices quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up or markdown or commissions. The OTC Bulletin Board prices listed below may not represent actual transaction prices. High Low First Quarter 2010 $ 0.90 $ 0.52 Second Quarter 2010 (through May 25, 2010) $ 0.88 $ 0.50 First Quarter 2009 $ 1.06 $ 0.36 Second Quarter 2009 $ 0.90 $ 0.55 Third Quarter 2009 $ 1.00 $ 0.69 Fourth Quarter 2009 $ 0.95 $ 0.55 First Quarter 2008 $ 1.49 $ .052 Second Quarter 2008 $ 1.00 $ .051 Third Quarter 2008 $ 0.71 $ .025 Fourth Quarter 2008 $ 0.70 $ 0.25 On May 25, 2010 the closing sales price of our common stock as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board was $0.80 per share. As of May 25, 2010 there were 629 record holders of our common stock. Our transfer agent is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. DIVIDEND POLICY We have not in the past and do not intend in the foreseeable future to pay or declare any cash dividends. We are prohibited from paying any cash dividends to our common stockholders until all accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Junior Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock have been paid in full and all principal amounts due and payable under our 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes have been paid in full. The declaration of any dividends on our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors, including contractual obligations, deemed relevant by our board of directors. 15 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our actual capitalization at March 31, 2010 and our capitalization as adjusted to reflect (i) the estimated net proceeds we will receive from the sale of units offered by this prospectus at an assumed offering price of $ per unit, after deducting the placement agency fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us; (ii) the mandatory conversion of shares of Series B Junior Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock, 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes and the 12% Convertible Notes into shares of common stock. You should read this table together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Use of Proceeds included elsewhere in this prospectus. At March 31, 2010 Actual As Adjusted Cash $ 308,000 Current debt 660,000 Long-term debt 1,172,000 Net capital deficiency: Preferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 10,000,000 shares authorized: Series A Convertible Cumulative, 157,592 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2010 and on an as adjusted basis  Series B Voting Junior Convertible Cumulative, 5,210,101 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2010 and 0 shares issued and outstanding on an as adjusted basis  Common stock, $0.0001 par value; 100,000,000 shares authorized; 42,933,973 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2010 and shares issued and outstanding on an as adjusted basis 4,000 Additional paid-in capital 47,952,000 Deficit accumulated during the development stage (55,910,000 ) Net capital deficiency (7,954,000 ) Total capitalization $ 946,000 16 Table of Contents OUR BUSINESS Business History We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 24, 2005 as SRKP 6, Inc., which we refer to as SRKP. On August 3, 2005 we filed a registration statement on Form 10-SB, subsequently amended on August 29, 2005, to register our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). The registration statement became effective on October 3, 2005, after which time we became a reporting company under the Exchange Act. We were formed to pursue a business combination with one or more operating companies. On March 30, 2007 we acquired Vicor Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to as Old Vicor, formed in August 2000, through the merger of Old Vicor with a wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of facilitating that transaction, which we refer to as the Merger. Upon the closing of the Merger on March 30, 2007, Old Vicor became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective March 31, 2007 we merged Old Vicor into our company and changed our name to Vicor Technologies, Inc. At the closing each outstanding share of Old Vicor common stock was cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive two shares of our common stock. We also assumed all outstanding options and warrants to purchase Old Vicor common stock which were not exercised, cancelled, exchanged, terminated, or expired. Upon the consummation of the Merger, we were obligated to issue an aggregate of 22,993,723 shares of our common stock to Old Vicors former common stockholders and 157,592 shares of our Series A Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock to Old Vicors former preferred stockholder. In addition, all securities convertible or exercisable into shares of Old Vicors capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (excluding Old Vicors preferred stock and convertible debt) were cancelled, and the holders thereof received similar securities for the purchase of an aggregate of 800,250 shares of our common stock. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, to be applied as an equity recapitalization in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting, SRKP was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. In accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances, the Merger was considered to be a capital transaction in substance. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of Old Vicor issuing stock for the net monetary assets of SRKP, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net monetary assets of SRKP were stated at their fair value, essentially equivalent to historical costs, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The accumulated deficit of Old Vicor was carried forward after the Merger. Operations prior to the Merger are those of Old Vicor. Overview We are a medical diagnostics company focused on commercializing noninvasive diagnostic technology products based on our patented, proprietary point correlation dimension algorithm (the PD2i ® Algorithm). The PD2i ® Algorithm and software facilitates the ability to accurately risk stratify a specific target population to predict future pathological events, such as cardiac death (which includes arrhythmic death and congestive heart failure death), imminent death from trauma and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We believe that the PD2i ® Algorithm and software represents a noninvasive monitoring technology that physicians and other members of the medical community can use as a new and accurate vital sign. We are currently commercializing two proprietary diagnostic medical products which employ software utilizing the PD2i ® Algorithim: the PD2i Analyzer tm (sometimes referred to as the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm ) and the PD2i- VS TM (Vital Sign). It is also anticipated that the PD2i ® Algorithm and software applications will allow for the early detection of Alzheimers Disease and other disorders and diseases. We own all of the outstanding common stock of Nonlinear Medicine, Inc., a Delaware corporation (NMI), and Stasys Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (STI). NMI owns all of our intellectual property related to our diagnostic products, and STI owns all of our intellectual property related to our therapeutic products. Our first product, the PD2i Analyzer tm , received 510(k) marketing clearance to measure heart rate variability from the FDA on December 29, 2008. It displays and analyzes electrocardiographic (ECG) information and measures heart rate variability (HRV) in patients at rest and in response to controlled exercise and paced respiration. The PD2i Analyzer tm applies patented and proprietary technology to analyze a high resolution 17 Table of Contents electrocardiograph (ECG) signal, and measure R-wave intervals . The clinical significance of HRV and other parameters must be determined by a physician. We commenced sales of the PD2i Analyzer tm in January 2010. We also entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with VF Medical, a medical products distribution company, for South Carolina, North Carolina, and the cities of Savannah and Augusta, Georgia. VF Medical will utilize a 25-person medical products distribution team consisting of agents who have long-term relationships with cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and family practice and internal medicine physicians within the designated territory. We are seeking other distributors and have begun hiring sales personnel in selected geographic areas. The PD2i Analyzer tm consists of a private-label digital electrocardiograph device that incorporates automated blood pressure recording and a laptop computer which utilizes proprietary collection software. The PD2i Analyzer tm accesses the internet and sends recorded electrocardiograph files to our remote server where the files are analyzed by our proprietary algorithm and software. The analyzed results are then provided to the physician in an electronic health record together with a report and information which the physician can use to bill both public and private insurers. Established CPT codes allow the physician to currently bill and collect from both public and private insurers. Vicor bills the physician monthly for the number of tests performed, thus enabling us to realize revenue from the recurring use of the PD2i Analyzer tm in addition to revenue realized from the sale of the device. We anticipate making various submissions to the FDA for marketing clearance for the PD2i Analyzer tm for additional medical claims, related to cardiology, imminent death from trauma and possibly the diagnosis of diseases related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Approval from the FDA would allow us to expand and accelerate our marketing efforts. Technology Background The PD2i ® Algorithm provides a method for evaluating heart rate variability electrophysiological potentials (from electrocardiograms) with a high sensitivity and high specificity which can be used to predict future pathological events, such as cardiac death, including arrhythmic death, and congestive heart failure death, imminent death from trauma and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The PD2i ® Algorithm is designed to detect deterministic, low-dimensional excursions in nonstationary heartbeat intervals. We believe the PD2i ® Algorithm is superior because it uses an analytic measure that is deterministic and nonlinear; it actually tracks nonstationary changes in the data and does not require stationarity. It is sensitive to chaotic, as well as nonchaotic linear data. The PD2i Analyzer tm works as follows. The patient is connected using either the four leads required for the PD2i Analyzer tm testing or the full 12 leads, if desired. Once started, the device will prompt the operator and patient through each test. Subtle changes in HRV are detected and ratios are automatically calculated. The PD2i Analyzer tm ensures excellent quality and reliability of results and automatic internal quality editing. The PD2i Analyzer tm applies patented and proprietary technology to analyze a high resolution electrocardiograph (ECG) signal, and measure R-wave intervals. The PD2i Analyzer tm ratios that result are compared to an age-specific normal range automatically. The test can be performed in an office in about 20 minutes. It requires the recumbent patient to perform: (i) a deep breathing exercise, (ii) a Valsalva maneuver, and then (iii) to stand for two minutes. A report is automatically generated at the end of the test. The test data is relayed via Internet, between the physicians office and a secure data processing site. The report (which is EHR compliant) is then returned to the PD2i Analyzer tm in under one minute, where it can be printed, faxed, or emailed. Additionally, a physician or technician can access their patient files for viewing from any web browser allowing for true portability. The report from the PD2i Analyzer tm includes the PD2i ® score, the Ewing ratios and a 12 second ECG rhythm strip. Our technology provides novel solutions to recognized problems associated with HRV analysis. The results are easily interpreted against a device-specific normal range, are automated and computerized. Quality assurance of the integrity of the results obtained comes from the fact that the algorithm used for the HRV analysis is not affected by irregularities in heart rhythm or intrinsic heart disease. The PD2i Analyzer tm also provides a noise-filtering and noise-correcting feature that further ensures the quality of its measurements. 18 Table of Contents Diagnosis of Diseases Cardiovascular Disease Statistics from 2006 (which are the most current statistics published by the American Heart Association) estimate that 81,100,000 people in the United States have one or more forms of cardiovascular disease including high blood pressure, coronary heart disease and heart failure. Cardiovascular disease claimed an estimated 831,272 lives in 2006 which represented 1 out of every 2.9 deaths or approximately 33%. The majority of patients with cardiovascular disease fall into two categories, congestive heart failure patients and cardiac ischemia patients. Congestive Heart Failure Congestive heart failure or heart failure, which we refer to as CHF, is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to the bodys other organs. This can result from any of the following conditions:  narrowed arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, which is referred to as coronary artery disease;  past heart attack, or myocardial infarction, with scar tissue that interferes with the heart muscles normal work;  high blood pressure;  heart valve disease due to past rheumatic fever or other causes;  primary disease of the heart muscle itself, called cardiomyopathy;  heart defects present at birth, which is referred to as congenital heart defects; and  infection of the heart valves and/or heart muscle itself, which is referred to as endocarditis and/or myocarditis. The failing heart continues working but not as efficiently as it should. People with congestive heart failure become short of breath and tired when they exert themselves. As blood flow out of the heart slows, blood returning to the heart through the veins backs up, causing congestion in the tissues. Often swelling, or edema, results  typically in the legs and ankles, but swelling may occur in other parts of the body too. Fluid may also collect in the lungs and interfere with breathing, causing shortness of breath, especially when a person is lying down. Congestive heart failure also affects the kidneys ability to dispose of water and sodium. The retained water in turn increases the swelling. The most common signs of congestive heart failure are swollen legs or ankles or difficulty breathing. Another symptom is weight gain as a result of fluid build up. A doctor needs to properly tailor a treatment program to an individual patient. Depending on the severity of the disease, most people with mild and moderate congestive heart failure can be treated. A treatment program can consist of:  rest;  proper diet;  modified daily activities; and  drugs such as:  ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors;  beta blockers;  digitalis;  diuretics; and  vasodilators. 19 Table of Contents ACE inhibitors and vasodilators expand blood vessels and decrease resistance. This allows blood to flow more easily and makes the hearts work more efficient or easier. Beta blockers can improve how well the hearts left ventricle pumps. Digitalis increases the pumping action of the heart, while diuretics help the body eliminate excess water and sodium. When a specific cause of congestive heart failure is discovered, it should be treated or, if possible, corrected through the use of medications or implantable devices, such as a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy-Defibrillator (CRT-D) or Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD). For example, certain cases of congestive heart failure can be treated by treating high blood pressure and in other instances if the heart failure is caused by an abnormal heart valve, the abnormal heart valve can be surgically replaced. If the heart becomes so damaged that it cannot be repaired, a more drastic approach, such as a heart transplant, may need to be considered as an option. Cardiac Ischemia Ischemia is a condition that occurs when blood flow and oxygen are restricted from a particular part of the body. Cardiac ischemia is the name for the condition of lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart. Ischemic heart disease is a term that covers heart problems caused by a narrowing of the arteries. Less blood and oxygen are able to reach the heart muscle when arteries are narrowed. This is also referred to as coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease and this condition may ultimately lead to a heart attack. Ischemia often causes chest pain or discomfort known as angina pectoris. The American Heart Association estimates however that as many as 3 to 4 million Americans may have ischemic episodes and not even know they are suffering these episodes. These people have ischemia without pain, or silent ischemia, and they may have a heart attack without prior warning. People with angina also may have undiagnosed episodes of silent ischemia. Additionally, people who have suffered previous heart attacks or have diabetes are at a higher risk for developing silent ischemia. An exercise test or wearing a 24-hour portable monitor, which is referred to as the Holter monitor, that measures and records your electrocardiogram continuously during a 24-48 hour period are two tests that are often used to diagnose this problem, although other tests may also be used. Arrhythmic Death Arrhythmic death (sometimes referred to as sudden cardiac death or SCD) is a sudden, unexpected death caused by loss of heart function. It is the largest cause of natural death in the United States (in excess of 300,000 adult deaths). Arrhythmic death is caused by arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). The most common life-threatening arrhythmia is ventricular fibrillation, an erratic, disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles. When this occurs, the heart is unable to pump blood, and death will occur within minutes if left untreated. Arrhythmic death is not a heart attack. A heart attack occurs due to blockage in one or more of the coronary arteries that feed the heart muscle, resulting in lack of blood flow to the heart muscle and consequential heart muscle damage. In contrast, during arrhythmic death, the electrical system to the heart suddenly becomes irregular. The ventricles may flutter or quiver (ventricular fibrillation), and blood is not delivered to the body. Of greatest concern in the first few minutes is that blood flow to the brain will be reduced so drastically that a person will lose consciousness. Death follows unless emergency treatment is begun immediately. Survival can be as high as approximately 90% if treatment is initiated within the first few minutes after symptoms develop. The survival rate decreases by about 10% each minute treatment is delayed. Proper evaluation by a physician can prevent arrhythmic death through an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). There are approximately 13 million people who currently meet the criteria to receive an insurance paid ICD. The risk stratification criteria to include patients for ICD implantation was established by three clinical trials: the Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT), the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillation Trial (MADIT-II) and Sudden Cardiac Death  Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT). The principal causes of death for cardiovascular patients is either arrhythmic death or congestive heart failure death (pump failure). 20 Table of Contents Diagnostic Tools for Pump Failure Death and Arrhythmic Death There presently are no readily available diagnostic tools that enable the easy identification of patients at elevated risk of pump failure death. In early 2009, Vicor signed a Research Agreement with the University of Rochester and the Catalan Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences in Barcelona to collaborate on the PD2i ® analysis of data collected for the Merte Subita en Insufficiencia Cardiaca (MUSIC) Trial. The collaboration is entitled Prognostic Significance of Point Correlation Dimension Algorithm (PD2i) in Chronic Heart Failure. The goal of the study was to evaluate the ability of our PD2i ® nonlinear algorithm to predict cardiac events in the 537 chronic heart failure patients enrolled in the MUSIC Trial; MUSIC Trial participants were followed for an average period of 44 months. The conclusion of the University of Rochester researchers who conducted the study is that the PD2i ® nonlinear algorithm and software is predictive of total mortality, cardiac death, and heart failure death in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 35%, which refers to the percentage of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heart beat. With a P value of 0.004 the study results are highly statistically significant. Researchers from the University of Rochester and our scientists are studying these initial results to determine whether the resulting data will support a 510(k) submission to the FDA for a marketing claim that in congestive heart failure patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 35% who have a PD2i ® score less than or equal to 1.4, there is a substantially elevated risk of total mortality, cardiac mortality and pump failure mortality. We believe that the results from this trial may broaden the market for the PD2i Analyzer tm as a diagnostic tool that will significantly contribute to cardiologists in their assessment of treatment options for heart failure patients. Current diagnostic tests to determine patients at risk of arrhythmic death include noninvasive diagnostic tools such as an electrocardiogram or ECG, ambulatory monitoring, echocardiography, cardiac stress test and invasive diagnostic tools, such as cardiac catheterization or an electrophysiology study. The current invasive diagnostic tools to determine patients at risk of arrhythmic death have all of the risks that accompany any major surgery. Additionally, we believe that existing noninvasive tools suffer from three significant drawbacks. First, the current noninvasive diagnostic tools are inaccurate because (a) they are insensitive to nonlinearities in the data, (b) they assume random variation in the data (stochastic) and (c) the system generating the data cannot change during the recording. Second, the current noninvasive diagnostic tools require a stress test, which involves risk for patients. Background of Autonomic Nervous System Testing Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction is among the least recognized and understood serious complications of diabetes. It often manifests itself as diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN), which impacts the entire autonomic nervous system. It causes substantial morbidity and increased mortality, particularly if cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is present. The American Diabetes Association recommends annual screening of the 24+ million diabetics for DAN. The most common non-invasive method of diagnosis is heart rate variability testing in patients at rest and in response to three maneuvers (commonly referred to as the Ewing maneuvers). Those maneuvers include metronomic breathing, the Valsalva maneuver and rising from a recumbent position to standing, all of which stress components of the autonomic nervous system. Clinical tests employing HRV analysis have been extensively studied and published by medical researchers over the last forty years in the United States and internationally. This research has demonstrated the potential for the application of HRV tests to include cardiac and cardiovascular risk stratification and for identifying the presence of autonomic neuropathy, a condition which is particularly prevalent among people with diabetes. Several HRV-measuring devices are now used as tools for evaluating patients for the presence of autonomic neuropathy. Many such devices have been designed with a focus on the diabetic population, but despite the growing incidence of diabetes, these devices have not yet been widely adopted by clinicians. The diabetes market still represents a largely untapped market for technology able to facilitate objective identification of autonomic nervous system dysfunction and autonomic neuropathy. If not diagnosed prior to the manifestation of autonomic neuropathic symptoms, diabetics are at significantly greater risk of developing debilitating or fatal end-organ damage, which is more difficult and more expensive to treat than in its early stages. 21 Table of Contents Diagnostic Tools for Autonomic Nervous System In 1996, specific measurement of HRV was recognized by the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (now known as the Heart Rhythm Society) as a predictor of risk after acute myocardial infarction (MI) and as an early warning sign of diabetic neuropathy. Since that time, a vast amount of research and experience has been collected and reviewed by medical societies and researchers worldwide. Now, HRV measurement is a standard of care for the management of people with diabetes, and in objectively diagnosing autonomic neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy is highly prevalent among patients with diabetes, and is associated with markedly heightened cardiac risk. About 25% of diabetic adults have clinically significant autonomic neuropathy. Since the condition is a degenerative one, it can be graded in degrees of severity for any given patient population. Treatment is most effective in the earlier stages of neuropathy prior to end-organ damage, so making an early diagnosis is important. Even if diabetic patients are already being screened for peripheral sensory (somatic) neuropathy, as many as 46% of them could have autonomic neuropathy without having sensory neuropathy. It has been demonstrated in various studies that, for individuals with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, a positive test for (i) vibration perception threshold, or (ii) the presence of peripheral neuropathy or chronic painful neuropathy, or (iii) abnormal nerve conduction studies, is not necessarily associated with the presence of autonomic neuropathy. Furthermore, looking for autonomic symptoms is not an adequate approach to managing autonomic neuropathy; a patients history and physical examination are ineffective for early detection of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN); the symptoms of autonomic neuropathy tend to occur when its development is advanced and difficult to treat. HRV testing may also facilitate differential diagnosis and the attribution of symptoms (e.g., erectile dysfunction, dyspepsia, dizziness) to autonomic dysfunction. Products and Markets PD2i Analyzer tm The PD2i Analyzer tm received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA on December 29, 2008. The PD2i Analyzer tm displays and analyzes electrocardiographic (ECG) information and measures heart rate variability (HRV) in patients at rest and in response to controlled exercise and paced respiration. The clinical significance of HRV and other parameters must be determined by a physician. On January 14, 2010 we announced our first commercial sale of the PD2i Analyzer tm to a physician practice in South Carolina and simultaneously announced that we had entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with VF Medical, a medical products distribution company. VF Medical will serve as the exclusive distributor for the PD2i Analyzer tm in South Carolina, North Carolina, and the cities of Savannah and Augusta, Georgia. VF Medical will utilize a 25-person medical products distribution team consisting of agents who have long-term relationships with cardiologists, electrophysiologists, family practice and internal medicine physicians within the designated territory. The PD2i Analyzer tm consists of a private-label digital electrocardiograph device that incorporates automated blood pressure recording and a laptop computer which utilizes proprietary collection software. This device accesses the internet and sends recorded electrocardiograph files to our remote secure server where the files are analyzed by our proprietary algorithm and software. The analyzed results are then provided to the physician in an electronic health record together with a report and information which the physician can use to bill both public and private insurers. Established CPT codes allow the physician to currently bill and collect from both public and private insurers. Vicor bills the physician monthly for the number of tests performed, thus enabling us to realize revenue from the recurring use of the PD2i Analyzer tm in addition to revenue realized from the sale of the device. PD2i-VS We also plan on commercializing the PD2i- VS product. This product is being developed in collaboration with the United States Army and is used to assess the severity of critically injured combat casualties to determine the 22 Table of Contents need for immediate life saving intervention in those trauma victims who are at high risk of imminent death. The PD2i- VS is anticipated to be used for civilian triage and trauma emergency response. In January 2008 we executed a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (Research and Development Agreement) with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (U.S. Army) for Prediction of Injury Severity and Outcome in the Critically Ill Using the Point Correlation Dimension Algorithm, or PD2i. The U.S. Army is exploring ways to assess the severity of injury and probability of survival of critically injured combat casualties and critically ill civilian patients. The U.S. Army, in conjunction with Vicor, is testing the PD2i - VS Algorithm in several diverse cohorts, including human trauma, patients in the intensive care units (ICU Patients) and combat casualties. Various experiments have been performed under the Research and Development Agreement and the US Army has presented the findings at several conferences in the United States and Europe. Manuscripts and abstracts have also been published by leading journals with Vicor and the US Army as co-authors. The PD2i- VS has been tested through this collaboration with the US Army in a variety of ways. The most recent data set, consisting of 325 civilian trauma files, is expected to be finalized and submitted to the FDA in the second half of 2010 for 510(k) marketing approval. If cleared, we can begin marketing the PD2i- VS for a claim of trauma triage. Additionally, at the request of the U.S. Army, we have substantially completed the programming necessary for the PD2i VS TM to operate as a continuous vital sign monitor. In this mode, the PD2i VS TM provides an initial result with three minutes of collected data and an updated result every minute thereafter. Each result is accompanied by an audible tone, and a green, yellow, or red light to indicate the patients change in status and alert the emergency response team of a need for aggressive and immediate lifesaving intervention. We have completed a modification of the R-R detector in our software to improve its already high sensitivity and accuracy. The accuracy of the time intervals between each heart beat the R-R interval is critical to the calculation of a PD2i ® value. The enhanced version of the continuous PD2i VS TM , together with the improved R-R-detector should enable the US Army to utilize our technology in an important prospective human trial, which we believe could be the last clinical test required before deployment. In summary, upon receipt of expanded 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA, the PD2i Analyzer tm will be marketed with specific claims for (a) a diagnostic claim for those patients at elevated risk for cardiac mortality, (b) normal ranges for the PD2i ® values to facilitate physician interpretation of test results of the PD2i Analyzer tm and (c) a diagnostic claim for those patients at imminent risk of death in trauma. Regulatory Approval Process United States. The FDA classifies medical devices into Class I, II and III. The amount of regulatory control increases from Class I to Class III. The device classification regulation defines the regulatory requirements for a general device type. A full premarket notification process for a Class III device is the most detailed process, requiring the submission of clinical data to support claims made for the device. Class II devices require premarket notification on a 510(k) application. A 510(k) application is a premarketing submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is safe, effective and substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device (i.e. a predicate device) and is therefore not subject to premarket approval. The FDA has advised us that the predicate device for the PD2i Analyzer tm is a Class II device (pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 870.2340  Cardiovascular Devices  Cardiovascular Monitoring Devices  Electrocardiograph); thus the PD2i Analyzer tm is subject to the less onerous premarket notification for a 510(k) application. Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). In certain cases, including ours, the 510(k) application requires the submission of clinical data to support claims made for the device. For the FDA to permit applicants to undertake a clinical trial using unapproved medical devices on human subjects, applicants are required to seek an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). Clinical studies with devices of significant risk must be approved by the FDA and by an Institutional Review Board or IRB before the study can begin. Studies with devices of nonsignificant risk only need IRB approval before the clinical trails can begin. The FDA has advised us that the PD2i Analyzer tm is a nonsignificant risk device. Thus, we are not required to obtain FDA approval before we conduct any clinical trials. 23 Table of Contents 510(k) Application. Once the 510(k) application is received by the FDA, a preliminary screening is undertaken. If the 510(k) application is found to contain all the required elements, it will be assigned to a reviewer. When the reviewer needs additional information to complete the review, the applicant is contacted with a request or deficiency letter that will detail the information needed. The 510(k) applications are reviewed in order, according to the original or additional information receipt date. After the technical review is completed, the reviewers recommendation is forwarded to the division director for concurrence. If the division director concurs, then the FDA will issue the decision letter to the applicant. Generally, an FDA decision takes 90 to 180 days after receipt of the 510(k) application. However, certain items, including the amount of time it takes an applicant to respond to any FDA requests for additional information, may delay the FDA decision. We received 510(k) marketing clearance for the PD2i Analyzer tm in December 2008. We are in the process of completing or analyzing the data from three clinical trials. We plan on using the data from these clinical trials for additional 510(k) submissions with which to establish (a) a diagnostic claim for those patients at elevated risk for cardiac mortality, (b) normal ranges for the PD2i ® values to facilitate physician interpretation of test results of the PD2i Analyzer tm and (c) a diagnostic claim for those patients at imminent risk of death in trauma. These trials and the analysis of data from these trials are expected to cost approximately $150,000, in the aggregate, in 2010 and are described in the following table: Our Products and Status of Clinical Trials Status of FDA Product Use Clinical Trial Submission PD2i-Analyzer tm Diagnostic Tool to Risk Stratify Cardiac Death University of Rochester  comparing PD2i ® values to patient outcomes has been completed Expected in the second quarter of 2010 (Marketing clearance anticipated in the second half of 2010) PD2i Analyzer tm Normal Range Values for PD2i ® Awaiting Institutional Review Board Approval at the University of Mississippi Medical Center Expected in the third quarter of 2010 PD2i  VS Diagnostic tool to Triage Trauma U.S. Army  Data Analysis being completed Expected in the second half of 2010 (Marketing clearance anticipated in the second half of 2010) These additional claims will permit the acceleration of marketing and sales activities and facilitate the direct marketing to physicians of the PD2i Analyzer tm for different medical uses. As the PD2i Analyzer tm and our other products become commercially available, it is anticipated that independent researchers will conduct their own independent research on areas of interest to them without financial support from Vicor which should reduce our research and development expenses in the future. However, as we explore other applications for the technology, the related research may require us to sponsor clinical trials which could require substantial expenditures. 24 Table of Contents Current trials underway at various institutions, some of which are sponsored by Vicor and some of which are being independently conducted, include: Trial Name Market Indication Independent or Vicor Sponsored Cardiac Risk in the Youth (CRY) Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young Independent  Inherited Cardiovascular Disease and Sports Cardiology Centre at St. Georges Healthcare NHS Trust-United Kingdom Brain Injury Risk Stratification Trial (BIRST) Neuro-ICU Vicor Sponsored  University of Mississippi Medical Center Cardiac Arrhythmia Assessment and Safety in Athletes (CAASA) Sudden Cardiac Death-Student Athletes Vicor Sponsored  University of Mississippi Complexity Analysis During Renal Dialysis (CARD) Sudden Cardiac Death-Dialysis Patients Vicor Sponsored  University of Mississippi Medical Center Cardiac Autonomic Regulation Enhancement Through Exercise (CARE-E) Cardiac Rehabilitation Independent  Brown University Cardiac Autonomic Regulation Enhancement Through Therapy (CARE-T) Cardiac Rehabilitation Independent  Brown University Complexity Analysis Studies of Trauma in the Emergency Department (CASTED) ICU/Mobile Triage Vicor Sponsored  University of Mississippi Medical Center Complexity Analysis During Blood Donation (CABLD) Internal Bleeding Vicor Sponsored  University of Mississippi Medical Center and Mississippi Blood Bank Massachusetts General Hospital Trauma Trauma Triage Independent  Massachusetts General Hospital European Regulatory Requirements We may be required to receive CE Mark Certification, an international symbol of quality and compliance with applicable European community medical device directives, prior to marketing our products in Europe. If such certification is required, we must comply with the Essential Requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, which primarily relate to safety and performance and have our products undergo conformity assessment certification by a notified body. If we are required to obtain the CE Mark Certification, we plan to begin this process in the later half of 2010 for our products. Sales and Marketing On January 14, 2010 we announced our first commercial sale of the PD2i Analyzer tm to a physician practice in South Carolina and simultaneously announced that we had entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with VF Medical, a medical products distribution company. VF Medical, LLC will serve as the exclusive distributor for the PD2i Analyzer tm in South Carolina, North Carolina, and the cities of Savannah and Augusta, Georgia. VF Medical, LLC will utilize a 25-person medical products distribution team consisting of agents who have long-term relationships with cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and family practice and internal medicine physicians within the designated territory. Additionally, we plan on marketing the PD2i Analyzer tm to our physician base  350 stockholders and 450 members of our National Cardiac Panel  as early adopters of our technology to ensure that (a) the product is well received by physicians interested in Vicors success and (b) product enhancement suggestions provided by these early adopters can be incorporated into the technology before a national roll-out. The PD2i Analyzer tm can be used as a diagnostic tool under 60 international classification of disease (ICD-9) codes. 25 Table of Contents Once FDA 510(k) marketing clearance is obtained for cardiac mortality, our sales and marketing will be directed towards physicians who identify individuals at risk of arrhythmic death and pump failure death from those cardiac patients who may not be at risk. Our target patient populations will include those individuals with underlying cardiac disease. In the United States, those populations include more than 7 million patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction (heart attack), 5 million patients suffering from congestive heart failure (poor pumping function), and more than 1 million other patients suffering from conditions including syncope (fainting and dizziness) and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (damaged and enlarged heart). Therefore, we believe that the aggregate at-risk patient population in the United States that are candidates for our PD2i Analyzer tm diagnostic test exceeds 13 million. MUSTT, MADIT-II and SCD-HeFT type patients represent a major and important subset of this at-risk patient population as evidenced by the results of the MUSIC Trial. The main target customers for our PD2i Analyzer tm are (i) physicians who specialize in family practice and internal medicine and (ii) clinical cardiologists and electrophysiologists. Our marketing strategy is to segment the internal medicine, family practice and cardiologist market and target technology-friendly early adopters. We anticipate primarily utilizing independent distributors complemented by an in-house sale force which we will establish. The United States market although significant, represents only a fraction of the total potential worldwide market for the products. Therefore, we anticipate marketing the products in Europe primarily through distribution partners; discussions with potential partners are ongoing. Our PD2i- VS product is in its early stages. Assuming successful completion of the product, we plan on marketing it to hospitals and emergency response providers. We will consider licensing the technology to existing monitor companies as well as developing our own proprietary monitor for sale. Reimbursement Reimbursement to healthcare providers by third party insurers is critical to the long-term success of our efforts to make the PD2i Analyzer tm the standard of care for patients being screened for autonomic nervous system dysfunction, as well as being evaluated in the future for risk of cardiac death. There are 60 ICD-9 diagnosis codes for which the performance of the test as a diagnostic tool can be justified. There are established Current Procedural Terminology Codes, known as CPT codes, that provide a national level of reimbursement of approximately $80-$160 per test to the physicians for using the PD2i Analyzer tm . CPT codes provide a uniform language used by healthcare providers to describe medical services and tests. Coding is used to communicate to third party insurers the services that have been performed for billing purposes and affect both the coverage decision and amount paid by such insurers. Physicians are currently being reimbursed for the use of the PD2i Analyzer tm from insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid. Competition Congestive Heart Failure Death We believe there are presently no known diagnostic tools used for the identification of congestive heart failure patients at elevated risk of death. Arrhythmic Death Noninvasive diagnostic tools for arrhythmic death are relatively new in the cardiac diagnostic field, thus the current market competition for this type of product is limited. The major direct competitor of the PD2i Analyzer tm is Cambridge Heart, Inc. (Cambridge Heart). According to its filings with the SEC, Cambridge Heart has several products, including the Heartwave System, CH 2000 Cardiac Stress Test System, and Micro-V Alternans Sensors. All of these products have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for sale in the United States. They have also received the CE mark for sale in Europe and have been approved for sale by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. These products have been sold since 2000. We believe our PD2i Analyzer tm will deliver a more accurate prediction of arrhythmic death, is substantially less expensive and is a procedure that is more patient friendly than the CH 2000 Cardiac Stress Test System. The key disadvantages of the Cambridge Heart products are that (i) they require a stress test to capture the T-wave alternans, 26 Table of Contents (ii) the stress test itself is not without risk; it could induce cardiac arrest, (iii) the procedure requires costly electrodes for which physicians are not separately reimbursed, and (iv) most importantly, the procedure cannot be performed on patients exhibiting ectopic or irregular heartbeats or taking beta-blockers used to treat coronary artery disease. The key competitive advantages of the PD2i Analyzer tm are that (i) it avoids risks associated with a cardiac stress test, (ii) it can be performed on a resting patient in any environment, (iii) it can be performed without specialized equipment, (iv) costly electrodes are not required, (v) it is not affected by ectopic or irregular heartbeats, (vi) it is not affected by common cardiac drugs, and (vii) there is no significant up-front equipment cost to the physician. At our expected price of approximately $7,500 per unit and $25-$50 per test, the PD2i Analyzer tm will offer clinicians an affordable product that will appropriately pay them and us based on usage. Autonomic Nervous System Our principal competitor of the PD2i Analyzer tm is Ansar Group, Inc. (Ansar). According to its website, Ansar has developed the ANX 3.0, a noninvasive, real time digital monitor of autonomic nervous system functioning. The ANX 3.0 monitor costs approximately $40,000. We believe the PD2i Analyzer tm is more cost effective and offers a superior solution for physicians based on our business model and the increased utility of our PD2i ® measure of HRV. Indirect competition for the PD2i Analyzer tm is traditional clinical screening tests, which are performed by physicians. However, a patients history and physical examination are ineffective for early detection of cardiac autonomic neuropathy, the symptoms of autonomic neuropathy tend to occur when its development is advanced and difficult to treat. HRV testing may also facilitate differential diagnosis and the attribution of symptoms (e.g., erectile dysfunction, dyspepsia, dizziness) to autonomic dysfunction. Manufacturing We are in the process of finalizing our manufacturing agreements with third parties. We intend to acquire both the digital ECG and laptop computers from third parties and Vicor will install the appropriate proprietary software and test for quality assurance before re-packaging for shipment. Trademarks We pursue and maintain trademark protection in the United States and worldwide. As of May 15, 2010 we have three United States registered trademarks for PD2i for use on our products. Research and Development Our research and development expenses for December 31, 2008 and 2009 and for the three months ended March 31, 2010 were approximately $993,000, $964,000 and $157,000, respectively. These research and development expenses included, but were not limited to laboratory supplies, hardware costs, programming and software costs, sponsored research activities and salary and fringe benefit costs for employees who were engaged in research, development, clinical and regulatory activities. In addition, all clinical trial costs, clinical and regulatory consulting and contract manufacturing costs are included. Employees As of May 15, 2010 we employed twelve individuals, and engaged the services of several consultants. All of our employees are leased under a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) arrangement pursuant to a Service Agreement with ALDA & Associates International, Inc., a consulting company owned and controlled by David H. Fater, our Chief Executive and Financial Officer. Of our employees, nine are engaged in executive, administrative, business development, sales, marketing and intellectual property functions, and three are engaged in research and development and clinical/regulatory activities. We anticipate that we will need to recruit additional personnel to manage our expanded selling and administrative functions as well as our research and product development programs. 27 Table of Contents Drug Discovery Platform (Therapeutic Products) The mission of our drug discovery platform was to focus on the pre-clinical and early clinical development of products for the treatment of an array of human diseases, such as cerebral ischemia (stroke), cardiac ischemia, kidney failure, organ transplantation and preservation, hypertension, obesity, and thrombolytic diseases. At the present time, our drug discovery platform is not active. Since 2003 to conserve cash and focus on FDA marketing clearance for the PD2i Analyzer tm , we halted all research related to our drug platform. Certain naturally occurring peptides and proteins are derived from state-dependent physiologies, a naturally occurring process under which certain mammals engage in altered physiologic states, such as hibernation, REM sleep and pregnancy. We believe that these molecules lead to altered physiological states, such as blood pressure reduction, loss of appetite and thirst, diminished cancerous cell growth and reproduction, urea recycling and tissue and organ preservation. Our initial drug discovery efforts related to those state-dependent peptides and proteins released during hibernation. Hibernation is a complex grouping of individual physiologies that are spread out over time. Cessation of appetite occurs many weeks before the animal goes into the sleep-like state in which blood pressure and metabolism are reduced. It is the separate and specific individual physiologies that are of interest to us for pharmaceutical development, not the complex event of hibernation itself. It has been demonstrated, for example, that blood-pressure elevations can be reduced to normal in awake, non-hibernating animals without inducing all of the other hibernation-related physiologies (i.e., appetite suppression). We believe that similar results can be achieved with other physiologies. We developed a strategy which we believe will enable us to isolate the naturally occurring, state- dependent, nontoxic, bioactive molecules that are produced during hibernation of certain mammals, such as the woodchuck. We anticipate using these molecules, as well as their derivatives, to treat major human diseases, such as stroke and cardiac ischemia. Through the execution of this strategy in 2000-2003, we identified the amino acid sequence of several peptides discovered in the blood of hibernating mammals (some of which are also found in humans), which have been successfully tested for efficacy in pre-clinical animal studies of cerebral ischemia. This animal model replicates human stroke. These ischemia-preventing molecules have also been shown to be nontoxic in animal toxicology studies. We also conducted a pre-IND briefing meeting with the FDA in March 2003 to develop the Clinical Development Plan for our lead stroke compound as part of the Investigational New Drug (IND) process. We filed our United States Utility and Foreign Patent Application in February 2003. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the PTO) advised us that certain important claims relating to the drug discovery platform (the Anti-infarction patent) and its applicability for stroke would be allowed, thus permitting the issuance of one or more patents. On May 4, 2010, we announced that we received a Notice of Allowance from the PTO for our United States Utility and Foreign Patent Application for a method of treating ischemia through administration of a biologic identified through our state dependent drug discovery platform. Upon issuance, the patent will provide us with patent protection for methods of using a peptide to treat infarctions, such as cardiac or cerebral infarctions. Patent and Proprietary Rights As of March 31, 2010 we have four issued United States patents, three patents issued by foreign countries (South Africa, Eurasia and New Zealand) and two United States pending patent applications relating to our PD2i technology. We also have two foreign patents issued (Eurasia and South Africa) and one United States pending patent application relating to our drug discovery program. Our issued patents expire in 2024. In addition, we currently have 31 foreign pending patent applications. We have filed patents with Australia, Brazil, Canada, China (Peoples Republic), European Patent Office, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. We have also filed patents pursuant to the Eurasian Patent Convention and the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

The options vest 50% immediately and 12.5% per quarter thereafter. 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors or elsewhere in this prospectus. Plan of Operations At March 31, 2010 our cash balance was $308,000. From April 1, 2010 through May 10, 2010 we received proceeds of $840,000 from the sale of units consisting of 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock The warrants are exercisable at $1.00 per share and expire five years after date of grant. Based on our cash balance as of May 10, 2010, management believes that we have sufficient funds to continue current operations through at least July 31, 2010. Our plan of operations includes: 1. Continued and increased sales of the PD2i Analyzer tm to physicians in the United States through the use of independent distributors and direct sales personnel. 2. Raising additional capital with which to expand the sales and administrative infrastructure and fund ongoing operations until our operations generate positive cash flow. 3. Completing various clinical trials and 510(k) submission(s) to secure additional marketing claims for the PD2i Analyzer tm to enhance and accelerate marketing efforts. 4. Initiating international sales of the PD2i Analyzer tm and PD2i- VS tm (Vital Sign), including securing CE Mark Clearance, if required. However, we may not be successful in raising additional capital or in generating revenue. Furthermore, even if we raise additional capital and generate revenue, we may never achieve profitability or positive cash flow. If we are not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital and/or achieve profitability or positive cash flow, our operating business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting our results of operations: Research and Development Costs Research and development costs include payments to collaborative research partners and costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including wages and associated employee benefits, facilities and overhead costs. These are expensed as incurred. Intellectual Property Intellectual property, consisting of patents and other proprietary technology, are stated at cost and amortized on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. Costs and expenses incurred in creating intellectual property are expensed as incurred. The cost of purchased intellectual property is capitalized. Software development costs are expensed as incurred. Revenue Recognition Operating revenues commenced in January 2010 and are the result of product sales and fees for analysis of ECG data collected by physicians. Revenues are recognized at the time of product shipment or upon the performance of tests. The Company also plans on generating revenues from licensing fees which will be recognized in accordance with the contract terms. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We recorded equity-based compensation expense for employees and nonemployees in accordance with the fair-value provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, principally the result of granting stock options and warrants to employees with an exercise price below the fair value of the shares on the date of grant. 36 Table of Contents Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments We evaluate financial instruments using the guidance provided by ASC 815 and apply the provisions thereof to the accounting of items identified as derivative financial instruments not indexed to our stock. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company follows the provisions of ASC 820. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company uses fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative financial instruments payable in shares of its common stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions and projections to determine fair value. These require management judgment. Results of Operations Three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009 The following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of total expenses represented by certain items reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for each of the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the period from August 4, 2000 (inception) to March 31, 2010.

Our revenues consisted of $88,000 in fees generated from the sale of PD2i Analyzers tm to physicians and our independent distributor and $12,000 related to fees for analysis of ECG data collected by physicians. The independent distributor is using these devices primarily for demonstration purposes. Cost of Sales Cost of sales were $85,000, or 4.1% of total expenses, in the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with no cost of sales in the first quarter of 2009. Research and Development Research and development costs were $157,000 or 7.6% of total expenses, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $199,000 or 23.4% of total expenses, for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The principal reason for the decrease of $42,000 in 2010 was related to the different clinical trials conducted in 2010 compared to 2009. It is anticipated that research and development expenses will continue in 2010 at approximately the same level as 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative costs were $1,457,000, or 70.9% of total expenses, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $590,000, or 69.2% of total expenses, for the three months ended March 31 2009. The increase in expenses of $867,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 was principally attributable to: a) $432,000 for increased infrastructure and personnel to support the sales and information technology functions, b) $87,000 from amortization of offering expenses related to the 2009 sale of 8% Convertible Notes, c) $77,000 related to our increased investor relations activities, and d) $203,000 related to equity-based compensation arising from issuance of common stock and stock options to new employees. It is anticipated that our selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase throughout the year in response to increased sales and related infrastructure requirements. Interest Expense Interest expense was $357,000, or 17.4% of total expenses, for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, compared to $63,000, or 7.4% of total expenses, for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. The principal reason for the increase was due to increased indebtedness because of the issuance of 8% Convertible Notes and 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes. 38 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 The following table sets forth expenses and percentages of total expenses represented by certain items reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31 2009 2008 Revenues $  0.0 % $  0.0 % Operating expenses: Research and development 964,000 13.2 % 993,000 14.8 % General and administrative expenses 4,372,000 59.7 % 2,433,000 36.2 % Depreciation and amortization 41,000 0.6 % 41,000 0.6 % Interest expense 1,944,000 26.6 % 3,260,000 48.4 % Total operating expenses 7,321,000 100.0 % 6,727,000 100.0 % Realized/unrealized gain on derivative financial instruments 2,157,000 29.5 %  0.0 % Net loss (5,164,000 ) 70.5 % (6,727,000 ) 100.0 % Cumulative effect of change in accounting principal Dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders: Payable on Series A and Series B preferred stock (479,000 ) 6.5 % (246,000 ) 3.7 % Amortization of derivative discount on Series B preferred stock (979,000 ) 13.4 % 0.0 % Value of warrants issued in connection with sales of Series B preferred stock 0.0 % (1,536,000 ) 22.8 % Total dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders (1,458,000 ) 19.9 % (1,782,000 ) 26.5 % Net loss applicable to common stock $ (6,622,000 ) 90.4 % $ (8,509,000 ) 126.5 % Research and Development For the year ended December 31, 2009, research and development costs were $964,000, or 13.2% of total expenses, compared to $993,000, or 14.8% of total expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in the VITAL Trial costs due to its suspension and commencement of a collaboration with the University of Rochester for data analysis of the MUSIC Trial data for SCD, a less costly process. We anticipate that research and development costs will continue in the future, but at levels more closely approximating those of 2009. As our products become commercially available in the marketplace, we expect more collaborative research efforts from third parties to take place, reducing the extent to which Vicor-sponsored and funded research and development will be required. Selling, General and Administrative For the year ended December 31, 2009, selling, general and administrative costs were $4,372,000, or 59.7% of total expenses, compared to $2,433,000, or 36.2% of total expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $1,939,000 increase was due to increases of $572,000 of costs associated with convertible note offerings, $474,000 in legal and accounting fees resulting from advisory services to develop derivatives accounting procedures and legal fees related to various note offerings, $594,000 in consulting and computer programming fees incurred in readying our product for commercial launch, and in building the information technology infrastructure required to support the anticipated demands of our products and operations. 39 Table of Contents Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest costs were $1,944,000, or 26.6% of total expenses, compared to $3,260,000, or 48.4% of total expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest expense in 2009 included $1,665,000 recognized when debt securities containing embedded derivative features were converted into our common stock and amortization of the derivative discounts arising from sales of such debt securities. Interest expense in 2008 was unusually high because of incentives related to conversions of various notes payable into Series B Junior Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock and common stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources We generated revenues of $100,000 in the first quarter of 2010. However, our revenues are not sufficient to execute our business plan and continue development of our products. Accordingly, we continue to look to outside sources to raise capital. At March 31, 2010 we had a working capital deficiency of $1,113,000 and $308,000 in cash. From April 1, 2010 through May 10, 2010 we received proceeds of $840,000 from the sale of units consisting of 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Based on our cash balance as of May 10, 2010, management believes that we have sufficient funds to continue current operations through at least July 31, 2010. Management recognizes that we must generate additional funds to successfully continue operations. Management plans include the sale of additional equity and debt securities. We have raised approximately $23,900,000 since our inception in 2000 in a series of private placements of our common stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible notes to accredited investors, a number of which are physicians. However, we may not be successful in raising additional capital. Further, assuming that we raise additional funds, we may not achieve profitability or positive cash flow. If we are not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital and/or achieve profitability or positive cash flow, our operating business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Going Concern Our financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2010 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $1,475,000 and $2,448,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, and at March 31, 2010 had negative working capital of $1,113,000, an accumulated deficit of $55,910,000 and a net capital deficiency of $7,954,000. Although sales commenced in January 2010, we anticipate operating losses over the next 12 months (and likely longer) as we continue to incur expenditures necessary to further the commercial development of our products. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management recognizes that we must generate additional funds to successfully commercialize our products. Management plans include the sale of additional equity or debt securities, alliances or other partnerships with entities interested in and having the resources to support the further development of our products as well as other business transactions to assure continuation of our development and operations. We are executing our plan to secure additional capital through a multi-part funding strategy. We believe that the amount of capital generated by this plan will be sufficient to permit completion of various clinical trials and provide sufficient working capital for the next 24-30 months, by which time it is expected that we will generate positive cash flow through the sales of our products. However, no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional capital or entering into business alliances. Further, there can be no assurance, assuming we successfully raise additional funds or enter into a business alliance, that we will achieve profitability or positive cash flow. If we are not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital and/or achieve positive cash flow, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. 40 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement with an unconsolidated entity under which we have:  A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit;  Liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets; or  An obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to us, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Codification  The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, which we refer to as ASU, 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which we refer to as ASC, as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the SEC, under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative guidance for SEC registrants. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of authority. All nongrandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is superseded and deemed nonauthoritative. ASC 105 is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 105 had no impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  In January 2010 the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which provides additional guidance relating to fair value measurement disclosures. Specifically, companies will be required to separately disclose significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers. For Level 3 fair value measurements, the new guidance requires a gross presentation of activities within the Level 3 roll forward. Additionally, the FASB also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure requirements relating to the level of disaggregation, inputs, and valuation techniques. This ASU is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the detailed Level 3 disclosures, which are effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. Since ASU 2010-06 only affects disclosure requirements, the adoption of these provisions will have no impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ASC 825-10-65 updates ASC 825, Financial Instruments, to increase the frequency of fair value disclosures from an annual basis to a quarterly basis. The guidance relates to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on the balance sheet at fair value. These provisions of ASC 825 are effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. Since these provisions only affect disclosure requirements, the adoption of these provisions under ASC 825 had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Other new accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after March 31, 2010, are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following table presents information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock by the following persons as of May 25, 2010:  each of the named executive officers;  each of our directors;  all of our directors and executive officers as a group; and  each stockholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS Other than the transactions described below since January 2007 there has not been nor is there currently proposed any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we were or will be a party:  in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000; and  in which any director, executive officer, or stockholder owning more than 5% of our common stock, or any member of their immediate family had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Transactions with Management On January 1, 2007 we entered into a Service Agreement, which we refer to as the Service Agreement, with ALDA & Associates International, Inc., which we refer to as ALDA, a consulting company owned and controlled by Mr. Fater, whereby our employees became employees of ALDA under a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) arrangement. The Service Agreement is a cost-reimbursement-only contract and provides for our reimbursement of all of ALDAs actual payroll and insurance-related costs for these employees. The arrangement was entered into because of the substantial cost savings that could be obtained for us due to the higher number of employees employed by ALDA. In 2007, we borrowed $200,000 from Colonial Bank, N.A., which we refer to as Colonial Bank, on an unsecured basis under a loan agreement with a due date in August 2007 and an interest rate of 6.65%. As a condition to making the loan, Colonial Bank received a $200,000 certificate of deposit from our Chief Executive and Financial Officer, David H. Fater, as standby collateral. As consideration for this standby collateral, our board of directors authorized (i) the reimbursement of Mr. Faters out-of-pocket cash costs associated with this transaction, and (ii) the monthly issuance of 728 shares of our common stock. In 2009 Branch Banking and Trust Company acquired Colonial Bank, and this loan has been extended until January 10, 2011 at an interest rate of 3.54%. Also in 2007, we borrowed $100,000 from Colonial Bank on an unsecured basis under a loan agreement with a due date in August 2007 and an interest rate of 6.13%. As a condition to making the loan, Colonial Bank received a $100,000 certificate of deposit from Mr. Fater as standby collateral. As consideration for this standby collateral, our board of directors authorized (i) the reimbursement of Mr. Faters out-of-pocket cash costs associated with this 43 Table of Contents transaction, and (ii) the monthly issuance of 364 shares of our common stock. In 2009 Branch Banking and Trust Company acquired Colonial Bank, and this loan has been extended until October 2010 at an interest rate of 4.83%. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 and the three months ended March 31, 2010, respectively, Mr. Fater received 8,328, 13,104, 14,196 and 3,276 shares of our common stock related to these bank loans. In October 2002 we entered into a Purchase and Royalty Agreement, as amended in July and September 2003, which we refer to as the Royalty Agreement, with Dr. James E. Skinner, our Vice President and Director of Research and Development and a director of our company, to acquire the software related to the PD2i Analyzer tm . The total purchase price for the software was $200,000. To date we have paid $100,000, and we are required to pay the remaining $100,000 from 10% of any revenues that we receive from the sale, licensing, distribution or other use of the PD2i Analyzer tm . The Royalty Agreement further provides for an additional ongoing royalty to be paid to Dr. Skinner of 10% of revenues received by us from any activities that utilize the PD2i Analyzer tm including, without limitation, licensing and sales of the PD2i Analyzer tm for the life of the patents. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 and the three months ended March 31, 2010, respectively, Dr. Skinner did not receive any royalty payments. These royalty payments will commence after we have recovered our development costs in full. On June 11, 2007, Dr. Jerry M. Anchin, our Vice President, Associate Director of Research and Development and a director, sold 100,000 shares of our common stock in a privately-negotiated sale at a price of $0.50 per share and contributed to our capital the $50,000 proceeds he received.

The exercise price and the number of shares underlying the warrants are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends on our common stock, stock combinations or similar events affecting our common stock. In addition, in the event we consummate any merger, consolidation, sale or other reorganization event in which our common stock is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property or we consummate a sale of substantially all of our assets, then following such event, the holders of the warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which the holders would have received had they exercised the warrants immediately prior to such reorganization event.

Subject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time and ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock yields cumulative annual dividends at an annual rate of 8%. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will begin to accrue from their issuance date. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock have no preemptive rights or other subscription rights. The Series A Preferred Stock is senior to all other outstanding capital stock and is entitled to a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (i) the initial purchase price for the Series A Preferred Stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends or (ii) any accrued and unpaid dividends plus the amount such holder would have received if prior to such liquidation the Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Companys common stock without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing $6.35 by the conversion price. The conversion price shall initially be $6.35, plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares, whether or not declared. The conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment in the case of dilutive issuances and the issuance of additional shares of common stock. The Series A will automatically be converted into shares of common stock upon the consummation of a Liquidation Event, as defined in the Certificate of Designation. The Company may, at its option, require all holders of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding to convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock at any time on or after: (i) the closing of the sale of shares of our common stock, at a price per share greater than or equal to $5.00, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act resulting in at least $10,000,000 of gross proceeds to us or (ii) the consummation of a Liquidation Event, as defined in the Certificate of Designation. Series B Preferred Stock Each holder of Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock into which each share of Series B Preferred Stock held is convertible, on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Subject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time and ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock, each share of Series B Preferred Stock yields cumulative annual dividends at an annual rate of 8%. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will begin to accrue from their issuance date. Shares of Series B Preferred Stock have no preemptive rights or other subscription rights. The Series B Preferred Stock is junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and is entitled to a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (i) the initial purchase price for the Series B Preferred Stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends or (ii) any accrued and unpaid dividends plus the amount such holder would have received if prior to such liquidation the Series B Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Companys common stock without the payment of any additional consideration by the holder into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing $.80 by the conversion price. The conversion price shall initially be the lesser of $0.80 or 80% of the price per share of any common stock sold in the qualified financing plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares, whether or not declared. The conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment in the case of dilutive issuances and the issuance of additional shares of common stock. The Series B will automatically be converted into shares of common stock upon the consummation of a Liquidation Event, as defined in the Certificate of Designation.

Options and Warrants As of May 25, 2010, we have outstanding options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 18,886,842 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.01 to $1.00, per share, which expire on various dates from 2011 to 2016. Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws We are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of our board of directors or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the interested stockholder and the sale of more than 10% of our assets. In general, an interested stockholder is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors, which makes it more difficult for a stockholder or group of stockholders to radically change the character or composition of the board at any one time. Directors may only be removed for cause and by a vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may only be taken if it is properly brought before such meeting. Our stockholders may also take any action by written consent in lieu of a meeting. However, our stockholders may only call a special meeting of stockholders with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two thirds (2/3) of our then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on the election of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying until the next stockholder meeting stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two thirds (2/3) of our then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on the proposed amendment, in the case of the certificate of incorporation, or entitled to vote on the election of directors, in the case of the Bylaws, will be required to amend or revise our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws.

F-6 Table of Contents NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS Organization Vicor Technologies, Inc. (Vicor) is a development-stage company. As discussed in Note 3 Vicor generated operating revenues in the first quarter of 2010, but management does not believe these were significant enough for Vicor to be an operating enterprise at March 31, 2010. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include Vicor Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Nonlinear Medicine, Inc. (NMI) and Stasys Technologies, Inc (STI). Vicor has no operations independent of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. NMI owns all intellectual property related to Vicors diagnostic products, and STI owns all intellectual property related to the Companys therapeutic products. Nature of the business Vicor is a medical diagnostics company focused on commercializing noninvasive diagnostic technology products based on its patented, proprietary point correlation dimension algorithm (the PD2i ® Algorithm). The PD2i ® Algorithm and software facilitates the ability to accurately risk stratify a specific target population to predict future pathological events, such as fatal cardiac arrhythmias (which are related to sudden cardiac death), imminent death from trauma and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Vicor believes that the PD2i ® Algorithm and software represents a noninvasive monitoring technology that physicians and other members of the medical community can use as a new and accurate vital sign. Vicor is currently commercializing two proprietary diagnostic medical products which employ software utilizing the PD2i ® Algorithm: the PD2i Analyzer tm (sometimes referred to as the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm ) and the PD2i-VS tm (Vital Sign). It is also anticipated that the PD2i ® Algorithm and software applications will allow for the early detection of Alzheimers Disease and other disorders and diseases. Vicors first product, the PD2i Analyzer tm , received 510(k) marketing clearance from the Food and Drug Administration or FDA on December 29, 2008. It displays and analyzes electrocardiographic (ECG) information and measures heart rate variability (HRV), in patients at rest and in response to controlled exercise and paced respiration. The PD2i Analyzer tm applies patented and proprietary technology to analyze a high resolution electrocardiograph signal, and measure R-wave intervals. The clinical significance of HRV and other parameters must be determined by a physician. On January 14, 2010 Vicor announced its first commercial sale of the PD2i Analyzer tm to a physician practice in South Carolina and simultaneously announced that it had entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with VF Medical, LLC, a medical products distribution company. VF Medical, LLC will serve as the exclusive distributor for the PD2i Analyzer tm in South Carolina, North Carolina, and the cities of Savannah and Augusta, Georgia. VF Medical will utilize a 25-person medical products distribution team consisting of agents who have long-term relationships with cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and family practice and internal medicine physicians within the designated territory. Vicor is seeking other distributors and has begun hiring sales personnel in selected geographic areas. The PD2i Analyzer tm consists of a private-label digital electrocardiograph device that incorporates automated blood pressure recording and a laptop computer which utilizes proprietary collection software. The PD2i Analyzer tm accesses the internet and sends recorded electrocardiograph files to Vicors remote server where the files are analyzed by the Companys proprietary algorithm and software. The analyzed results are then provided to the physician in an electronic health record together with a report and information which the physician can use to bill both public and private insurers utilizing established Current Procedural Terminology Codes (CPT Codes). Vicor bills the physician monthly for the number of tests performed, thus enabling it to realize revenue from the recurring use of the PD2i Analyzer tm in addition to revenue realized from the sale of the device. Vicor anticipates making various submissions to the FDA for marketing clearance for the PD2i Analyzer tm for additional medical claims, such as sudden cardiac death, trauma and, possibly, the diagnosis of diseases related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Approval from the FDA would allow Vicor to expand and accelerate its marketing efforts. Risks The Company is subject to all the risks inherent in an early stage company in the medical device industry, which is subject to rapid technological change. The Company has numerous competitors, including major F-7 Table of Contents pharmaceutical and chemical companies, medical device manufacturers, specialized biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions. These competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that are being developed by the Company or that would render the Companys technology and products obsolete and noncompetitive. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the Company. In addition, many of the Companys competitors have significantly greater experience than the Company in pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of new or improved pharmaceutical products and in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals on products for use in health care. The Company is aware of various products under development or manufactured by competitors, which may use therapeutic approaches that compete directly with certain of the Companys products. The Company has limited experience in conducting and managing pre-clinical testing necessary to enter clinical trials required to obtain government approvals and has limited experience in conducting clinical trials. Accordingly, the Companys competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly than the Company, which could adversely affect the Companys ability to further develop and market its products. If the Company commences significant commercial sales of its products, it will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities, areas in which the Company has limited or no current experience. NOTE 2  LIQUIDITY The Companys financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2010 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $1,475,000 and $2,448,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, and at March 31, 2010 had negative working capital of $1,113,000, an accumulated deficit of $55,910,000 and a net capital deficiency of $7,954,000. Although sales commenced in January 2010, the Company anticipates operating losses over the next 12 months (and likely longer) as it continues to incur expenditures necessary to further the commercial development of its products. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management recognizes that the Company must generate additional funds to successfully commercialize its products. Management plans include the sale of additional equity or debt securities, alliances or other partnerships with entities interested in and having the resources to support the further development of its products as well as other business transactions to assure continuation of the Companys development and operations. The Company is executing its plan to secure additional capital through a multi-part funding strategy. The Company believes that the amount of capital generated by this plan will be sufficient to permit completion of various clinical trials and provide sufficient working capital for the next 24  30 months, by which time it is expected that the Company will generate positive cash flow through the sales of its products. However, no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital or entering into business alliances. Further, there can be no assurance, assuming the Company successfully raises additional funds or enters into a business alliance, that the Company will achieve profitability or positive cash flow. If the Company is not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital and/or achieve positive cash flow, its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The December 31, 2009 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial F-8 Table of Contents statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that are included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Companys condensed consolidated financial statement amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. The information presented as of March 31, 2010 and for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 has not been audited. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Companys consolidated financial position as of March 31, 2010 and the consolidated results of its operations for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 and its consolidated cash flows and net capital deficiency for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle On June 25, 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock. This Issue provides guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entitys own stock. If an embedded feature (for example, the conversion option embedded in a convertible debt instrument) does not meet the scope exception in ASC 815, it would be separated from the host contract (the debt instrument) and be separately accounted for as a derivative by the issuer. ASC 815 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years, to be applied to outstanding instruments as of the effective date. The Companys Series B preferred stock and related warrants contain terms in which the conversion or exercise price may be reduced if the company issues or sells shares of its common stock at a price less than the conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock or the exercise price of the warrants. Under the consensus reached in ASC 815, the conversion option is not considered indexed to the Companys own stock because the conversion rate can be affected by future equity offerings undertaken by the Company at the then-current market price of the related shares. Therefore, such embedded features are now accounted for as derivatives, which are presented as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. As a change in accounting principle, this resulted in adjustments on January 1, 2009 to decrease beginning additional paid-in capital by $4,049,000, to decrease accumulated deficit by $480,000 and to record derivative financial instruments payable in shares of common stock of $3,569,000. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Management believes the financial risks associated with these financial instruments are minimal. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions and makes short-term investments in high credit quality money market instruments of short-term duration. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. At March 31, 2010 the Company had no accounts with balances in excess of FDIC insured limits. Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method of accounting. F-9 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and major renovations or improvements are capitalized. Research and Development Costs Research and development expenditures, are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities. These include payments to collaborative research partners, including wages and associated employee benefits, facilities and overhead costs. These are expensed as incurred. Revenue Recognition The Company generated operating revenues in January 2010 which consisted of product sales and fees for analysis of ECG data collected by physicians. Revenues are recognized at the time of product shipment or upon performance of tests. The Company also plans on generating revenues from licensing fees which will be recognized in accordance with the contract terms. The Company obtained Phase I and II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Grants in 2003-2005 amounting to a total of $844,000. The funds received were utilized to develop software for the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm and to conduct a study of 700 patients with chest pain presenting at emergency rooms in six (6) tertiary care facilities. The aim of the grant was to test and establish good medical practice through wide experimental use of the PD2i Analyzer tm at different emergency room sites with high risk patients. The funds received for this Grant have been treated as revenues by the Company in its condensed consolidated financial statements and were recorded when costs to perform such research and development activities were incurred. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Intellectual Property Intellectual property, consisting of patents and other proprietary technology acquired by the Company is stated at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. December 31, March 31, 2009 2010 Patents $ 252,000 $ 252,000 Purchased software 200,000 200,000 452,000 452,000 Less accumulated amortization (223,000 ) (234,000 ) Net intellectual property $ 229,000 $ 218,000 Amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 was $11,000 in each period. Legal fees related to the prosecution of new patents and intellectual property are expensed as incurred and amounted to $63,000 in each period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of F-10 Table of Contents revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company uses the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation arrangements under which compensation cost is determined using the fair value of stock-based compensation determined as of the grant date and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered. The Company has also granted stock purchase warrants to independent consultants and contractors and values these warrants using the fair value-based method described in the preceding paragraph. The compensation cost so determined is recognized over the period the services are provided which usually results in compensation cost being recognized at the date of the grant. Financial Instruments The carrying amount of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and notes payable approximates fair value as of December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010. Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets, management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flow of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period. The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows. During the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010 there were no deemed impairments of long-lived assets. Recent Accounting Pronouncements New accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective are not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. NOTE 4  CURRENT DEBT At December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010 current debt consists of: December 31, March 31, 2009 2010 2004 Notes $ 250,000 $ 250,000 12% Convertible Promissory Notes 110,000 110,000 Bank loans 100,000 300,000 $ 460,000 $ 660,000 2004 Notes The 2004 Notes consist of a 12% convertible promissory note payable to a stockholder and is convertible to common stock at $2.25 per share. 12% Convertible Promissory Notes The 12% Convertible Promissory Notes bear interest at 12% per annum, payable monthly and the maturity dates have been extended on a month-by-month basis. F-11 Table of Contents Bank Loans The Company has unsecured loans of $200,000 and $100,000 from Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) (formerly Colonial Bank, N.A.) under a loan agreement. The $200,000 loan is due January 2011, resulting in its being classified as long term at December 31, 2009 and short-term at March 31, 2010, and bears interest at 3.54%. The $100,000 loan is classified as current, has a due date of October 2010 and bears interest at 4.83%. As a condition to making the loans, the bank received certificates of deposit for $100,000 and $200,000 from the Companys Chief Executive and Financial Officer, David H. Fater, as standby collateral. As consideration for this standby collateral, the Companys Board of Directors authorized (i) the reimbursement of Mr. Faters out-of-pocket cash costs associated with this transaction, (ii) the Companys receipt of interest from the certificates of deposit as an offset to the Companys interest expense, and (iii) the monthly issuance of 1,092 shares of common stock. NOTE 5  LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt consists of: December 31, March 31, 2009 2010 8% Convertible Notes $ 773,000 $ 560,000 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes 278,000 612,000 Bank loans 200,000  Balance $ 1,251,000 $ 1,172,000 8% Convertible Notes During the period from May 1, 2009 through September 17, 2009 the Company sold 8% Convertible Notes (8% Notes). The 8% Notes are due two years from date of issue and are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder any time prior to maturity. The conversion price is equal to the lesser of 75% of the weighted average common stock price, as defined, for the three days immediately prior to the date of the conversion notice or $1.07 per share of common stock. The conversion rights embedded in the 8% Notes are accounted for as derivative financial instruments because of the static conversion terms embedded therein. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments at their issue dates were $1,966,000. December 31, March 31, 2009 2010 8% Notes sold $ 2,671,000 $ 2,671,000 8% Notes converted (1,574,000 ) (1,978,000 ) 1,097,000 693,000 Unamortized discount (324,000 ) (133,000 ) Balance $ 773,000 $ 560,000 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009 the Company sold 8% Subordinated Convertible Notes (8% Subordinated Notes). The 8% Subordinated Notes are due on October 7, 2012 and are subordinated to 8% Notes sold between May 1, 2009 and September 17, 2009. They are subject to mandatory conversion into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of $.80 per share of common stock or 80% of the price per share of common stock sold in a qualified funding event, defined as the sale of debt or equity in a registered offering resulting in a least $3,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Company. F-12 Table of Contents Until the 8% Notes have been converted by the holders or have been repaid (which shall be no later than September 16, 2011) the holders of the 8% Subordinated Notes have no voluntary conversion rights. Thereafter, the holders may voluntarily convert the 8% Subordinated Notes. The conversion rights embedded in the 8% Subordinated Notes are accounted for as derivative financial instruments because of the static conversion terms embedded therein. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments at their issue dates were $1,164,000. December 31, March 31, 2009 2010 8% Subordinated Notes sold $ 903,000 $ 1,873,000 Unamortized discount (625,000 ) (1,261,000 ) Balance $ 278,000 $ 612,000 NOTE 6  OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS AND OPTIONS At March 31, 2010 the Company had 13,860,842 warrants outstanding with an average exercise price of $0.98, 122,500 stock options outstanding with an average exercise price of $0.78 under the 2002 Stock Option Plan and 3,042,500 options outstanding with an average exercise price of $0.67 under the 2008 Stock Option Plan. During the three months ended March 31, 2010:  25,000 shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of 25,000 warrants at an exercise price of $0.01 per share.  475,000 options were issued to employees and consultants at exercise prices ranging from $.65 per share to $.71 per share pursuant to the 2008 Stock Option Plan. The options vest ratably over a 12-month period and expire 7 years after the grant date.  1,462,500 warrants to purchase common stock were issued in connection with the sale of 8% Subordinated Notes. The warrants are immediately exercisable at $1.00 per share and have a five-year term. NOTE 7  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company measures financial assets in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:  Level 1  Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, or interest in open-end mutual funds that allow a company to sell its ownership interest back at net asset value (NAV) on a daily basis. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets, liabilities or funds.  Level 2  Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer, or broker markets, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active.  Level 3  Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other valuation methodologies, such as option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, and not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions. Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets or liabilities. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. F-13 Table of Contents Recurring Fair Value Measurement Valuation Techniques The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. The Company considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including limited trading of the Companys stock since the commencement of trading in July 2007. Derivative Financial Instruments The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of conversion options embedded in 8% Notes, 8% Subordinated Notes, Series B Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase common stock issued with preferred stock. These instruments are valued with pricing models commonly used by the financial services industry using inputs generally observable in the financial services industry. These models require significant judgment on the part of management, including the inputs utilized in its pricing models. The Companys derivative financial instruments are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company estimates the fair value of derivatives utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: December 31, March 31, 2009 2010 Conversion feature: Risk-free interest rate 1.4% - 3.0% 0.84% - 2.55% Expected volatility 63% 63% Expected life (in years) 2 - 5 2 - 5 Expected dividend yield 0% 0% Warrants: Risk-free interest rate 1.4% - 3.0% 2.55% Expected volatility 63% 63% Expected life (in years) 5 5 Expected dividend yield 0% 0% Fair value: Conversion feature $2,550,000 $3,093,000 Warrants $1,864,000 $2,042,000 The Companys methodology to estimate volatility of its common stock is based on an average of published volatilities contained in the most recent audited financial statements of other publicly-reporting companies in industries similar to that of the Company. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Level 3 liabilities include instruments whose value is determined using pricing models and for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. As of March 31, 2010 instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3 represented approximately 58% of the Companys total liabilities. F-14 Table of Contents Fair values of liabilities measured on a recurring basis at March 31, 2010 are as follows: Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant Other Significant for Identical Observable Unobservable Liabilities Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Liabilities: Derivative financial instruments $ 5,135,000 $  $  $ 5,135,000 Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the Level 3 category. As a result the gains for liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the tables below may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. The following table presents additional information about Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the year ended March 31, 2010: Balance, January 1, 2010 $ (4,414,000 ) Included in earnings as gain (loss)(1): Realized 112,000 Unrealized(2) (229,000 ) Purchases, sales, and other (604,000 ) Settlements and issuances  net  Net transfers in and/or out of Level 3  Balance, March 31, 2010 $ (5,135,000 ) (1) Gain included in earnings is reported as gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments. (2) Total unrealized loss related to Level 3 instruments held at March 31, 2010. NOTE 8  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In 2003 the Company purchased the software related to the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm from one of its founding scientists, who is now an employee and a director. Terms of the Purchase and Royalty Agreement provide that $100,000 of the purchase price be deferred until the Company begins receiving revenue from the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm Accordingly, this amount is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as Due to Related Parties. The Agreement further provides for an ongoing royalty to be paid to the scientist amounting to 10% of amounts received by the Company from any activities relating to the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm for the life of the patents. Royalty payments will commence after the Company has recovered its development costs in full. Additionally, on January 1, 2007 the Company entered into a Service Agreement (Service Agreement) with ALDA & Associates International, Inc. (ALDA), a consulting company owned and controlled by the Companys Chief Executive and Financial Officer whereby three of the Companys employees became employees of ALDA under a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) arrangement. This was subsequently increased to seven employees. The Service Agreement, which is a cost reimbursement only contract, provides for reimbursement of all of ALDAs actual payroll and insurance related costs for these employees. Costs associated with the contract amounted to $187,000 and $380,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. As discussed in Note 4 the Company has certain bank loans. As a condition to making the loans, the bank received two certificates of deposit valued at $300,000 from the Companys Chief Executive and Financial Officer, David H. Fater, as standby collateral. NOTE 9  RETIREMENT PLAN In December 2009 the Company established a defined contribution plan (Plan) to provide retirement benefits in return for services rendered. The Plan provides an individual account for each participant and has terms that specify how contributions to participant accounts are determined. Employees are eligible to participate in the F-15 Table of Contents Plan at time of hire as well as certain independent contractors at the discretion of management. The Plan provides for the Company to match employee contributions up to 4% of the employees salary and also provides for Company discretionary contributions of up to 6% of employee compensation. As of March 31, 2010 no contributions had been made by the Company. NOTE 10  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In the period from April 1, 2010 through May 10, 2010, the Company received proceeds of $949,000 from the sale of 8% Subordinated Notes and warrants to purchase 1,380,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrants expire 5 years after grant date. Through May 11, 2010 the holders of all the remaining outstanding 8% Notes had notified the Company of their intent to convert all such notes held by them into 2,484,717 shares of the Companys common stock. Issuance of the stock will satisfy the Companys obligations under the 8% Notes. F-16 Table of Contents VICOR TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VICOR Technologies, Inc. (the Company) a Delaware Corporation as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity (net capital deficiency) and cash flows for the years then ended and the period from August 4, 2000 (inception) through December 31, 2009. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards as established by the Auditing Standards Board (United States) and in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of VICOR Technologies, Inc. at December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended and the period from August 4, 2000 (inception) through December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and had negative cash flows from operations that raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Daszkal Bolton LLP Boca Raton, Florida March 31, 2010 F-18 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc.

F-25 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1  Organization and Nature of Business Organization Vicor Technologies, Inc. (Vicor, the Company) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 24, 2005 as SRKP 6, Inc. (SRKP). On August 3, 2005 SKRP filed a registration statement on Form 10-SB, subsequently amended on August 29, 2005, to register common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). The registration statement became effective on October 3, 2005, after which time SKRP became a reporting company under the Exchange Act. The Company was formed to pursue a business combination with one or more operating companies. On March 30, 2007 SKRP acquired Vicor Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Old Vicor) formed in August 2000, through the merger (Merger) of Old Vicor with a wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of facilitating that transaction. Upon the closing of the Merger on March 30, 2007, Old Vicor became a wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective March 31, 2007 Old Vicor was merged into SKRP and changed its name to Vicor Technologies, Inc. At the closing each outstanding share of Old Vicor common stock was cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive two shares of Vicor common stock. The Company also assumed all outstanding options and warrants to purchase Old Vicor common stock which were not exercised, cancelled, exchanged, terminated, or expired. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the Company was obligated to issue an aggregate of 22,993,723 shares of its common stock to Old Vicors former common stockholders and 157,592 shares of its Series A Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock) to Old Vicors former preferred stockholder. In addition, all securities convertible or exercisable into shares of Old Vicors capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (excluding Old Vicors preferred stock and convertible debt) were cancelled, and the holders thereof received similar securities for the purchase of an aggregate of 800,250 shares of Vicor common stock. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, to be applied as an equity recapitalization in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting, SRKP was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. In accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances, the Merger was considered to be a capital transaction in substance. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of Old Vicor issuing stock for the net monetary assets of SRKP, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net monetary assets of SRKP were stated at their fair value, essentially equivalent to historical costs, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The accumulated deficit of Old Vicor was carried forward after the Merger. Operations prior to the Merger are those of Old Vicor. All share and per share amounts were restated to reflect the recapitalization. The Company owns all of the outstanding common stock of Nonlinear Medicine, Inc., a Delaware corporation (NMI), and Stasys Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (STI). NMI owns all intellectual property related to Vicors diagnostic products, and STI owns all intellectual property related to the Companys therapeutic products. Nature of the business Vicor is a medical diagnostics company focused on commercializing noninvasive diagnostic technology products based on its patented, proprietary point correlation dimension algorithm (the PD2i ® Algorithm). The PD2i ® Algorithm facilitates the ability to accurately risk stratify a specific target population to predict future pathological events. The Company believes that the PD2i ® Algorithm represents a noninvasive monitoring technology that physicians and other members of the medical community can use as a new and accurate vital sign and is currently commercializing two proprietary diagnostic medical products which employ software utilizing the PD2i ® Algorithim: the PD2i Analyzer tm (sometimes also referred to as the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm ) and the F-26 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements PD2i-VS tm (Vital Sign). It is also anticipated that the PD2i ® Algorithm applications will allow for the early detection of Alzheimers disease and other disorders and diseases. The Companys first product, the PD2i Analyzer tm , received 510(k) marketing clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 29, 2008. The PD2i Analyzer tm displays and analyzes electrocardiographic (ECG) information and measures heart rate variability (HRV) in patients at rest and in response to controlled exercise and paced respiration. The clinical significance of HRV and other parameters must be determined by a physician. On January 14, 2010 Vicor announced its first commercial sale of the PD2i Analyzer tm to a physician practice in South Carolina and simultaneously announced that it had entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with VF Medical, LLC, a medical products distribution company. VF Medical, LLC will serve as the exclusive distributor for the PD2i Analyzer tm in South Carolina, North Carolina, and the cities of Savannah and Augusta, Georgia. VF Medical, LLC will utilize a 25-person medical products distribution team consisting of agents who have long-term relationships with cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and family practice and internal medicine physicians within the designated territory. The Company is seeking other distributors and has begun hiring sales personnel in selected geographic areas. In January 2008 Vicor executed a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (Research and Development Agreement) with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (US Army) for Prediction of Injury Severity and Outcome in the Critically Ill Using the Point Correlation Dimension Algorithm, or PD2i. The U.S. Army is exploring ways to assess the severity of injury, and probability of survival, of critically injured combat casualties and critically ill civilian patients. The US Army in conjunction with Vicor is testing the PD2i  VS tm in several diverse cohorts, including human trauma, patients in the intensive care units (ICU Patients) and combat casualties. Various experiments have been performed under the Research and Development Agreement, and the U.S. Army has presented the findings at several conferences in the United States and Europe. Manuscripts and abstracts have also been published by leading journals with Vicor and the US Army as co-authors. The PD2i-VS tm is anticipated to be used for civilian triage and trauma emergency response. In early 2009 Vicor signed a Research Agreement with the University of Rochester and the Catalan Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences in Barcelona to collaborate on the PD2i analysis of data collected for the Merte Subita en Insufficiencia Cardiaca (MUSIC) Trial. The collaboration is entitled Prognostic Significance of Point Correlation Dimension Algorithm (PD2i) in Chronic Heart Failure. The Company is using the PD2i Analyzer tm to retrospectively predict Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) in the 651 congestive heart failure patients who participated in the MUSIC Trial (of which 52 actually died from SCD). This analysis was completed in the first quarter of 2010, and Vicor believes it will yield a dataset sufficient to support a 510(k) submission to include a claim for SCD. Risks The Company is subject to all the risks inherent in an early stage company in the biotechnology industry. The biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and technological change. The Company has numerous competitors, including major pharmaceutical and chemical companies, medical device manufacturers, specialized biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions. These competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that are being developed by the Company or that would render the Companys technology and products obsolete and noncompetitive. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the Company. In addition, many of the Companys competitors have significantly greater experience than the Company in pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of new or improved pharmaceutical products and in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals on products or devices for use in health care. The Company has limited experience in conducting and managing pre-clinical testing necessary to enter clinical trials required to obtain government approvals and has limited experience in conducting clinical trials. Accordingly, the Companys competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly than F-27 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the Company, which could adversely affect the Companys ability to further develop and market its products. If the Company commences significant commercial sales of its products, it will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities, areas in which the Company has limited or no experience. Note 2  Liquidity The Companys financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $8,509,000 and $6,622,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, and at December 31, 2009 had negative working capital of $542,000, an accumulated deficit of $53,462,000 and a net capital deficiency of $6,610,000. The Company expects to continue to incur expenditures to further the commercial development of its products. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management recognizes that the Company must generate additional resources to successfully commercialize its products. Management plans include the sale of additional equity or debt securities, alliances or other partnerships with entities interested in and having the resources to support the further development of its products as well as other business transactions to assure continuation of the Companys development and operations. The Company is executing its plan to secure additional capital through a multi-part funding strategy. The Company believes that the amount of capital generated by this plan will be sufficient to permit completion of various clinical trials and provide sufficient working capital for the next 24  30 months, by which time it is expected that the Company will generate positive cash flow through the sales of its products. However, no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital or entering into business alliances. Further, there can be no assurance, assuming the Company successfully raises additional funds or enters into a business alliance, that the Company will achieve profitability or positive cash flow. If the Company is not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital and/or achieve positive cash flow, its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. Note 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Companys consolidated financial statement amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle On June 25, 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock. This Issue provides guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entitys own stock, which is the first part of the scope exception in paragraph 11(a) of Statement 133. If an embedded feature (for example, the conversion option embedded in a convertible debt instrument) does not meet the scope exception in paragraph 11(a) of Statement 133, it would be separated from the host contract (the debt instrument) and be separately accounted for as a derivative by the issuer. ASC 815 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years, to be applied to outstanding instruments as of the effective date. F-28 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Companys Series B preferred stock and related warrants contain terms in which the conversion or exercise price may be reduced if the company issues or sells shares of its common stock at a price less than the conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock or the exercise price of the warrants. Under the consensus reached in ASC 815, the conversion option is not considered indexed to the Companys own stock because the conversion rate can be affected by future equity offerings undertaken by the Company at the then-current market price of the related shares. Therefore, such embedded features are now accounted for as derivatives, which are presented as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. As a change in accounting principle, this resulted in adjustments on January 1, 2009 to decrease beginning additional paid-in capital by $4,049,000, to decrease accumulated deficit by $480,000 and to record derivative financial instruments payable in shares of common stock of $3,569,000. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Management believes the financial risks associated with these financial instruments are minimal. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions and makes short-term investments in high credit quality money market instruments of short-term duration. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. At December 31, 2009 the Company had accounts with balances in excess of FDIC insured limits by $257,164. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Property and Equipment Furniture, fixtures and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and major renovations or improvements are capitalized. Research and Development Costs Research and development expenditures, are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities. These include payments to collaborative research partners, including wages and associated employee benefits, facilities and overhead costs. These are expensed as incurred. Revenue Recognition As a development-stage enterprise, the Company had no significant operating revenues through December 31, 2009. As discussed in Note 1, operating revenues commenced in January 2010. Revenues will be predominately the result of product sales, fees for tests performed by physicians and licensing fees. Revenues will be recognized at the time of product shipment, performance of tests and execution of licensing contracts. The Company obtained Phase I and II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Grants in 2003-2005 amounting to a total of $850,000. The funds received were utilized to develop software for the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer and to conduct a study of 700 patients with chest pain presenting at emergency rooms in six (6) tertiary care facilities. The aim of the grant was to test and establish good medical practice through wide experimental use of the Analyzer at different emergency room sites with high risk patients. The funds received for this Grant have been treated as revenues by the Company in its consolidated financial statements and were recorded when costs to perform such research and development activities were incurred. F-29 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Intellectual Property Intellectual property, consisting of patents and other proprietary technology acquired by the Company is stated at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. December 31, 2008 2009 Patents $ 252,000 $ 252,000 Purchased software 200,000 200,000 452,000 452,000 Less accumulated amortization (186,000 ) (223,000 ) Net intellectual property $ 266,000 $ 229,000 Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 was $37,000 in each year. Legal fees related to the prosecution of new patents and intellectual property are expensed as incurred and amounted to $90,000 and $236,000 in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company uses the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation arrangements under which compensation cost is determined using the fair value of stock-based compensation determined as of the grant date and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered. The Company has also granted stock purchase warrants to independent consultants and contractors and values these warrants using the fair value-based method described in the preceding paragraph. The compensation cost so determined is recognized over the period the services are provided which usually results in compensation cost being recognized at the date of the grant. Financial Instruments The carrying amount of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and notes payable approximates fair value as of December 31, 2008 and 2009. Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets, management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flow of the individual assets over the remaining F-30 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements amortization period. The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, there were no deemed impairments of long-lived assets. Date of Management Review The Company evaluates events and transactions occurring subsequent to the date of the financial statements for matters requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements consider events through March 31, 2010, the date through which the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. Recent Accounting Developments Accounting Standards Codification  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission, (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative guidance for SEC registrants. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of authority. All nongrandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is superseded and deemed nonauthoritative. ASC 105 is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 105 had no impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Subsequent Events  In February 2010 the FASB issued ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events (Topic 855), to remove the requirement for SEC filers to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events. This change removes potential conflicts with current SEC guidance. ASU 2010-09 also clarifies the intended scope of the reissuance disclosure provisions, is effective upon issuance and had no impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. ASC 855 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued. ASC 855 defines (1) the period after the balance sheet date during which a reporting entitys management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, (2) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and (3) the disclosures an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. ASC 855 is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 855 had no impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  In January 2010 the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which provides additional guidance relating to fair value measurement disclosures. Specifically, companies will be required to separately disclose significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers. For Level 3 fair value measurements, the new guidance requires a gross presentation of activities within the Level 3 roll forward. Additionally, the FASB also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure requirements relating to the level of disaggregation, inputs, and valuation techniques. This ASU is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the detailed Level 3 disclosures, which are effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. Since ASU 2010-06 only affects disclosure requirements, the adoption of these provisions will have no impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. F-31 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ASC 825-10-65 updates ASC 825, Financial Instruments, to increase the frequency of fair value disclosures from an annual basis to a quarterly basis. The guidance relates to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on the balance sheet at fair value. These provisions of ASC 825 are effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. Since these provisions only affect disclosure requirements, the adoption of these provisions under ASC 825 had no impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Other new accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2009, are not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Note 4  Current Debt At December 31, 2008 and 2009 current debt consists of: 2008 2009 2004 Notes $ 250,000 $ 250,000 12% Convertible Promissory Notes 150,000 110,000 15% Promissory Notes 100,000  Bank loans 300,000 100,000 Other 100,000  $ 900,000 $ 460,000 2004 Notes The 2004 Notes consist of a 12% convertible promissory note payable to a stockholder and is convertible to common stock at $2.25 per common share. In 2006 the maturity of the 2004 Notes was extended, and unamortized interest expense of $24,000 resulting from this event was recognized in 2008. Also in 2008, $340,000 of the 2004 Notes were converted to 425,000 shares of Series B Junior Convertible Preferred Stock at $0.80 per share and noncash interest expense of $329,000 was recognized. Subsequently, the stockholder holding $250,000 of the 2004 Notes agreed to extend the maturity date on a month-by-month basis. 12% Convertible Promissory Notes The 12% Convertible Promissory Notes (12% Notes) were originally due at varying dates in 2007 and bear interest at 12% per annum, payable monthly. During 2007 the Company negotiated extensions of maturity and modified the terms of the conversion feature. During 2008 the Company converted $1,227,236 of the 12% Notes to 1,534,045 shares of Series B Junior Convertible Preferred Stock at $0.80 per share and $200,000 of the 12% Notes to 400,000 shares of Series B Junior Convertible Preferred stock at $0.40 per share. Noncash interest expense of $522,000 related to the debt conversions was recognized. Four of the 12% Notes valued at $72,000 were redeemed for cash and 11,719 immediately exercisable penalty warrants, which expire five years after date of issuance, were issued at an exercise price of $0.64 per share. The Company recognized $10,000 in noncash interest expense. Subsequently, the maturity dates of the remaining $110,000 of the 12% Notes have been extended on a month-by-month basis. F-32 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 15% Promissory Notes Interest on the 15% Promissory Notes (15% Notes) is payable monthly. In September 2009 the outstanding 15% Note was redeemed in a transaction where an individual purchased it from its holder and converted it into 200,000 shares of common stock. Noncash interest expense of $88,000 was recognized in this transaction. During 2008 the Company sold $300,000 of 15% Notes that included 90,000 shares of common stock representing $109,000 of interest expense. $400,000 of 15% Notes were converted into 1,000,000 shares of common stock, and $248,000 of interest expense was recognized. Also during 2008 the Company negotiated extensions of various 15% Notes in exchange for 115,000 shares of common stock representing $99,000 of interest expense. Noncash interest expense of $92,000 and $9,000 was recognized in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Bank Loans At December 31, 2008 the Company had unsecured loans of $200,000 and $100,000 from Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) (formerly Colonial Bank, N.A.) under a loan agreement. In 2009 the maturity of the $200,000 loan was extended, resulting in its being classified as long term at December 31, 2009. The $100,000 loan is classified as current, has a due date of October 26, 2010 and bears interest at 4.83%. As a condition to making the loans, the bank received Certificates of Deposit for $100,000 and $200,000 from the Companys Chief Executive and Financial Officer, David H. Fater, as standby collateral. As consideration for this standby collateral, the Companys Board of Directors authorized (i) the reimbursement of Mr. Faters out-of-pocket cash costs associated with this transaction, (ii) the Companys receipt of interest from the Certificates of Deposit as an offset to the Companys interest expense, and (iii) the monthly issuance of 1,092 shares of the Companys common stock. Mr. Fater received 13,104 and 14,196 shares of the Companys common stock in 2008 and 2009, respectively, related to these bank loans. Other Notes Payable In September 2008 the Company converted a $100,000 account payable to an unsecured 10% promissory note due in September 2009. In September 2009 the note holder consented to an arrangement whereby a third party purchased the note and immediately converted it into 200,000 shares of the Companys common stock. Noncash interest expense of $79,000 was recognized in this transaction. Note 5  Long-term debt Long-term debt consists of: 2008 2009 8% Convertible Notes $  $ 773,000 8% Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes  278,000 Bank loans (see Note 4)  200,000 $  $ 1,251,000 8% Convertible Notes At various times through September 17, 2009 the Company sold 8% Convertible Notes (8% Notes). The 8% Notes are due two years from date of issue and are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder any time prior to maturity. The conversion price is equal to the lesser of 75% of the weighted average common stock F-33 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements price, as defined, for the three days immediately prior to the date of the conversion notice or $1.07 per share of common stock. The conversion rights embedded in the 8% Notes are accounted for as derivative financial instruments because of the static conversion terms embedded therein. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments at their issue dates were $1,966,000. 8% Notes sold $ 2,671,000 8% Notes converted in 2009 (1,574,000 ) 1,097,000 Unamortized discount (324,000 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 773,000 As 8% Notes were converted, debt discount of $1,059,000 was recognized as noncash interest expense. 8% Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes During the fourth quarter of 2009 the Company sold 8% Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes (8% Subordinated Notes). The 8% Subordinated Notes are due on October 7, 2012 and are subordinated to certain 8% Notes sold between May 1, 2009 and September 17, 2009 with a remaining balance of $841,000 at December 31, 2009. They are mandatorily convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of $.80 per share of common stock (the Fixed Conversion Price) or 80% of the price per share of common stock sold in a qualified funding event, defined as the sale of debt or equity in a registered offering resulting in a least $3,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Company. Until the 8% Notes have been converted by the holders or have been repaid (which shall be no later than September 16, 2011) the holders of the 8% Subordinated Notes have no voluntary conversion rights. Thereafter, the holders may voluntarily convert the 8% Subordinated Notes. The conversion rights embedded in the 8% Subordinated Notes are accounted for as derivative financial instruments because of the static conversion terms embedded therein. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments at their issue dates are $559,000. 8% Subordinated Notes sold $ 903,000 Unamortized discount (625,000 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 278,000 Note 6  Preferred Stock The Company has two classes of preferred stock: Series A Convertible Cumulative and Series B Voting Junior Convertible Cumulative. The Series A Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock (Series A) yields cumulative annual dividends at an annual rate of 8%. Dividends will accrue and compound annually on such amount from the date of issuance until paid in full or at the option of the holder converted into additional Series A Stock at $3.12 per share. At December 31, 2008 and 2009 accrued dividends payable were $243,000 and $303,000, respectively. Each share of Series A is convertible at the option of the owner into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of 1:1. The conversion price of the Series A is subject to adjustment to prevent dilution using a weighted-average anti-dilution formula. The Series A will automatically be converted into shares of common stock upon the consummation of a Liquidity Event, as defined. F-34 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Series A is senior to all other outstanding capital stock and is entitled to a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (i) the initial purchase price for the Series A plus accrued or declared dividends or (ii) the amount such holder would have received if prior to such liquidation the Series A had been converted into common stock. The Company has the right of first refusal to acquire the Series A and certain holders have entered into an Investor Rights Agreement providing for customary drag-along and tag-along rights in connection with a bona fide offer from a third party to acquire the Company. Furthermore, pursuant to the Investment Agreement, one of the holders has the right to designate one nonvoting observer to the Board of Directors. The Series B Voting Junior Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock (Series B) yields cumulative annual dividends at an annual rate of 8% that are paid in kind and is initially convertible into one share of common stock. At December 31, 2008 and 2009, accrued dividends payable were $191,000 and $530,000, respectively. Each share of Series B plus accrued dividends will automatically convert into shares of common stock upon the successful completion of a financing of at least $3,000,000. The consent of 2/3 of the holders of all series of Preferred Stock will be required to (i) amend or repeal any provision to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (ii) authorize or reclassify existing shares of stock, (iii) pay any dividend on or repurchase any shares under certain conditions, (iv) merge or sell assets requiring stockholder approval or declare bankruptcy, (v) liquidate or dissolve the Company, (vi) borrow funds outside the ordinary course of business or (vii) enter into any transaction with related parties or affiliates of the Company. Note 7  Stockholders Equity The Company has 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $0.0001. The Board has the authority to issue the shares in one or more series and to fix the designations, preferences, powers and other rights, as it deems appropriate. The Company has 100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.0001. Each share of common stock has one vote per share for the election of directors and all other items submitted to a vote of stockholders. The common stock does not have cumulative voting rights, preemptive, redemption or conversion rights. The Company has issued stock warrants to certain employees, vendors and independent contractors. The warrants are immediately exercisable for a period of three to ten years and enable the holders to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.01  $3.12. The fair value per warrant based on the Black-Scholes valuation method ranges from $0.31 to $4.99. The cost of these warrants was treated as compensation and, accordingly, the Company recorded expense of $251,000 and $883,000 for 2008 and 2009, respectively. F-35 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The fair value for these warrants was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.96% in 2008 and 1.87% -3.00% in 2009; dividend yield of 0%; common stock fair market value of $0.84 in 2008 and $0.68 in 2009, respectively; a weighted average expected warrant life of four years; and a volatility factor of 63% for both years.

F-36 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8  Stock Option Plan In 2002 the Companys stockholders approved the Vicor Technologies, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan (the 2002 Plan), which provides for the granting of options to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. Both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options may be issued under the provisions of the 2002 Plan. Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, members of the Board of Directors, independent consultants and advisors are eligible to participate in the 2002 Plan. The granting and vesting of options under the 2002 Plan are authorized by the Companys Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors. During 2002 the Company granted stock options to employees at an exercise price of $3.00 per share, which vested over a two year period.

Compensation expense related to the granting of options under the 2008 Plan was approximately $176,000 and $1,559,000 in 2008 and 2009, respectively. NOTE 9  Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This Topic defines fair value, establishes a measurement framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company measures financial assets in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:  Level 1  Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, or interest in open-end mutual funds that allow a company to sell its ownership interest back at net asset value (NAV) on a daily basis. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets, liabilities or funds.  Level 2  Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer, or broker markets, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active.  Level 3  Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other valuation methodologies, such as option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, and not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions. Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets or liabilities. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. F-38 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Recurring Fair Value Measurement Valuation Techniques The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. The Company considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including limited trading of the Companys stock since the commencement of trading in July 2007. Derivative Financial Instruments The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of conversion options embedded in 8% Convertible Notes, 8% Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes, Series B Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase common stock issued with preferred stock. These instruments are valued with pricing models commonly used by the financial services industry using inputs generally observable in the financial services industry. These models require significant judgment on the part of management, including the inputs utilized in its pricing models. The Companys derivative financial instruments are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company estimates the fair value of derivatives utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: December 31, January 1, 2009 2009 Conversion feature: Risk-free interest rate 2.10 % 1.4% - 3.0 % Expected volatility 63 % 63 % Expected life (in years) 5 2-5 Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % Warrants: Risk-free interest rate 2.10 % 1.4% - 3.0 % Expected volatility 63 % 63 % Expected life (in years) 5 2-5 Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % Fair value: Conversion feature $ 1,664,000 $ 2,550,000 Warrants $ 1,905,000 $ 1,864,000 $ 3,569,000 $ 4,414,000 Prior to January 1, 2009 the Company used the historical prices of its common stock to determine its volatility. Subsequently, the Company determined that the historical prices of its common stock were not the best proxy to estimate such volatility. Effective January 1, 2009 the Companys methodology to estimate volatility of its common stock is based on an average of published volatilities contained in the most recent audited financial statements of other publicly-reporting companies in industries similar to that of the Company. F-39 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Level 3 liabilities include instruments whose value is determined using pricing models and for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. As of December 31, 2009 instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3 represented approximately 58% of the Companys total liabilities. Fair values of liabilities measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2009 are as follows: Quoted prices in active markets for Significant identical other Significant liabilities observable unobservable Fair Value (Level 1) inputs (Level 2) inputs (Level 3) Liabilities: Derivative financial instruments $ 4,414,000 $  $  $ 4,414,000 Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the Level 3 category. As a result, the gains for liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the tables below may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. The following table presents additional information about Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the year ended December 31, 2009: Balance, January 1, 2009 $ (3,569,000 ) Included in earnings(1): Realized 1,083,000 Unrealized(2) 1,074,000 Purchases, sales, and other (3,008,000 ) Settlements and issuances  net 6,000 Net transfers in and/or out of Level 3  Balance, December 31, 2009 $ (4,414,000 ) (1) Gain included in earnings is reported as gain on derivative financial instruments. (2) Total unrealized gain related to Level 3 instruments held at December 31, 2009. Note 10  Related Party Transactions In 2003 the Company purchased the software related to the PD2i Cardiac Analyzer tm from one of its founding scientists, who is now an employee and a director. Terms of the Purchase and Royalty Agreement provide that $100,000 of the purchase price be deferred until the Company begins receiving revenue from the Analyzer. Accordingly, this amount is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as Due to Related Parties. The Agreement further provides for an ongoing royalty to be paid to the scientist amounting to 10% of amounts received by the Company from any activities relating to the PD2i Cardiac Device for the life of the patents. Royalty payments will commence after the Company has recovered its development costs in full. Additionally, on January 1, 2007 the Company entered into a Service Agreement (Service Agreement) with ALDA & Associates International, Inc. (ALDA), a consulting company owned and controlled by the Companys Chief Executive and Financial Officer whereby three of the Companys employees became employees of ALDA under a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) arrangement. This was subsequently increased to seven employees. The Service Agreement, which is a cost reimbursement only contract, provides for reimbursement of all F-40 Table of Contents Vicor Technologies, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of ALDAs actual payroll and insurance related costs for these employees. Costs associated with the contract amounted to $308,000 and $909,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. As discussed in Notes 4 and 5 the Company has certain bank loans. As a condition to making the loans, the bank received a two Certificates of Deposit valued at $300,000 from the Companys Chief Executive and Financial Officer, David H. Fater, as standby collateral. Note 11  Income Taxes For income tax purposes the Company has capitalized its losses (other than contract research and development) as start up costs. The startup costs will be amortized over a five-year period when operations commence. The tax loss carry forward at December 31, 2009 amounts to $2,207,061 and begins to expire in 2016. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets are shown below. A valuation allowance has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 and 2009 as realization of such assets is uncertain. 2008 2009 Deferred income tax assets: Tax loss carry forward $ 414,000 $ 830,000 Start up costs 13,695,000 15,071,000 Equity-based compensation expense 1,116,000 853,000 Deribative liability 260,000 1,661,000 General business credit carry forward  357,000 15,485,000 18,772,000 Deferred income tax liabilities: Debt discount on derivative instruments  $ (357,109 ) Total deferred tax asset $ 15,485,000 $ 18,414,891 Valuation allowance: Beginning of year $ (14,594,000 ) $ (15,485,000 ) (Increase) during the year (891,000 ) (2,929,891 ) $ (15,485,000 ) $ (18,414,891 ) Net deferred tax assets and liabilities $  $  Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, annual use of any of the Companys net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited if cumulative changes in ownership of more than 50% occur during any three year period.

Note 13  Leases The Company is obligated under an operating lease agreement for its administrative offices and office equipment. The lease is for a two-year term beginning August 2009. Annual future minimum lease obligations as of December 31, 2009 are $89,000 in 2010 and $56,000 in 2011. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 was $92,000 and $95,000, respectively. Note 14  Retirement plan In December 2009 the Company established a defined contribution plan (Plan) to provide retirement benefits in return for services rendered. The Plan provides an individual account for each participant and has terms that specify how contributions to participant accounts are determined. Employees are eligible to participate in the Plan at time of hire as well as certain independent contractors at the discretion of management. The Plan provides for the Company to match employee contributions up to 4% of the employees salary and also provides for Company discretionary contributions of up to 6% of employee compensation. The Company made an initial grant to the Plan equal to 4% of each participants 2009 base compensation, resulting in Plan expense of $54,000 for 2009. Note 15  Commitments and Contingencies The Company may from time to time be subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of pending legal proceedings will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company has employment agreements with its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Medical Officer and its scientists. Such agreements provide for minimum salary levels, adjusted annually for cost-of-living changes.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and officers as well as other employees and individuals against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed actions, suits or proceedings in which such person is made a party by reason of such person being or having been a director, officer, employee or agent to the corporation. The DGCL provides that Section 145 is not exclusive of other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Section 1 of Article VII of the Companys bylaws provide for indemnification by the Company of its directors, officers, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Section 8 of the Companys Amended and Restated Certification of Incorporation eliminates the liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under Delaware law. Under Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, a director shall not be exempt from liability for monetary damages for any liabilities arising (i) from any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) from acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Company. Under an insurance policy maintained by the Company, the directors and officers of the Company are insured, within the limits and subject to the limitations of the policy, against certain expenses in connection with the defense of certain claims, actions, suits or proceedings, and certain liabilities which might be imposed as a result of such claims, actions, suits or proceedings, which may be brought against them by reason of being or having been such directors or officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Company has been advised that, in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable The Placement Agency Agreement (Exhibit 1.1) will provide for indemnification by the Placement Agents, the Company, its directors and officers, and by the Company, of the Placement Agents, for certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), and affords certain rights of contribution with respect thereto.

Undertakings (1) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or a controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (2) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (a) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be a part of this registration statement at the time it was declared effective. (b) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
