Securities Being Offered: Up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Offering Price: The offering price of the common stock is $0.90 per share. We intend to request a registered broker-dealer to apply to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board upon our becoming a reporting entity under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. If our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and a market for our common stock develops, the actual price of stock will be determined by prevailing market prices at the time of sale or by private transactions negotiated by the Selling Shareholders. The offering price would thus be determined by market factors and the independent decisions of the Selling Shareholders.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes are immaterial may also impair the Companys business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of the Companys common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investments. THE SECURITIES BEING REGISTERED BY THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK TO THE INVESTORS AND SHOULD BE PURCHASED (IN THE AFTERMARKET IF ONE DEVELOPS) ONLY BY PERSONS THAT CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. THE PRICE HAS BEEN DETERMINED ON WHAT WE BELIEVE PURCHASERS OF A SPECULATIVE OFFERING WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE SECURITIES AND BEARS NO RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER TO MARKET VALUE, ASSETS, EARNINGS, BOOK VALUE OR ANY OTHER ESTABLISHED CRITERIA OF VALUE. Prior to investing in the shares, and assuming an aftermarket of these shares develops, an investor should consider carefully the following risks and highly speculative factors, which may affect our business. In analyzing this registration, prospective investors should carefully read and consider, among other factors, the following: RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS (1) Financing Risks The Company has limited financial resources, and there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available for expansion. Although the Company has been successful in the past in obtaining financing through borrowing and factoring, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future, as and when needed, or that the terms of such financing, if any, will be favorable. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of the Companys expansion. Such failure to obtain financing could also materially affect the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. (2) Changes in Health Care Market. The medical industry has increased its out-sourcing of various operations significantly over time including its staffing of nurses and other healthcare professionals in an effort to reduce costs and increase flexibility. This has created a market for outside vendors who can offer less expensive labor and more flexibility to the hospitals and healthcare facilities. Should hospitals and healthcare facilities out-source a significantly smaller portion of their labor in the future, this would have an adverse affect on the Companys revenue. (3) Customer Slow Payments The profitability of the Company is strongly affected by how quickly customers pay for invoiced services since financing account receivables is expensive. An increase in slow paying customers would have an adverse affect on the Companys profitability. For example, a number of times during 2008, the State of California was very slow in reimbursing hospitals and healthcare facilities for state funded medical care. In turn, hospitals and healthcare facilities were slow to pay our invoices. If instances of slow pay by our customers increases significantly in the future, this will have an adverse affect on our profitability. (4) Hiring Qualified Staff The Company must attract and retain nurses and other healthcare professionals who possess the skills, experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our customers. We compete for healthcare staffing personnel with other temporary healthcare staffing companies and with hospitals and healthcare facilities. We must continually evaluate and expand our temporary healthcare professional network to keep pace with our customers 8 needs. Currently, there is a shortage of qualified nurses in the western United States, competition for nursing personnel is increasing, and salaries and benefits have risen. We may be unable to continue to increase the number of temporary healthcare professionals that we recruit, decreasing the potential for growth of our business. Our ability to attract and retain temporary healthcare professionals depends on several factors, including our ability to provide temporary healthcare professionals with assignments that they view as attractive and to provide them with competitive benefits and wages. Moreover, if we are unable to attract and retain temporary healthcare professionals, the quality of our services to our customers may decline and, as a result, we could lose some customers. If we are unable to attract qualified nurses and other healthcare professionals at reasonable costs, it will have an adverse affect on our profitability. (5) Competing for Customers The healthcare staffing business is highly competitive. We compete with full-service staffing companies and with specialized temporary staffing agencies. Some of these companies may have greater marketing and financial resources than us. To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices or increasing marketing expenditures, we could lose revenues and our margins could decline. Because of the Companys experience, outstanding past performance and unique Internet system, we have and expect to continue to compete very well against other companies. (6) Securing and Filling New Orders from our Customers We do not have long-term agreements or exclusive guaranteed order contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility customers. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to continually secure new orders from our customers and to fill those orders with our temporary healthcare professionals. Our customers are free to place orders with our competitors. Therefore, we must maintain positive relationships with our hospital and healthcare facility clients. (7) Customer Patient Occupancy Demand for our services is significantly affected by the general level of patient occupancy at our hospital and healthcare customers facilities. When occupancy increases, temporary employees are often added before full-time employees are hired. As occupancy decreases, customers typically will reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees. In addition, we may experience more competitive pricing pressure during periods of occupancy downturn. Occupancy also fluctuates due to the seasonality of some elective procedures. We are unable to predict the level of patient occupancy at any particular time and its effect on our revenues and earnings. (8) Healthcare Reform The U.S. government has undertaken various efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation, regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and drug companies. In the recent past, the U.S. Congress has considered several comprehensive healthcare reform proposals. To the extent to which these efforts are successful, hospitals and other healthcare facilities may react by spending less on healthcare staffing, including nurses. If this were to occur, we would have fewer business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, State governments have also attempted to control the growth of healthcare costs. Furthermore, third party payors, such as health maintenance organizations, increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical care. Failure by hospitals and other healthcare facilities to obtain full reimbursement from those third party payors could reduce the demand or the price pa id for our services. (9) Risks Associated with Management of Growth Because of its small size, the Companys growth in accordance with its business plans, if achieved, will place a significant strain on its financial, operation and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the recruitment and retention of experienced managers, nurses and other health care personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely 9 execute our business plan. RISKS RELATED TO THE SECURITIES MARKET AND INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK (1) Resale of Our Securities May Be Difficult Because There is No Current Market For Our Securities and its Possible That No Market Will Develop.. There is no current public market for our securities, and no assurance that such a public market will develop in the future. Therefore there is no central place, such as stock exchange or electronic trading system, to resell your shares. If you do want to resell your shares, you will have to locate a buyer and negotiate your own sale. Even in the event that such a public market does develop, there is no assurance that it will be maintained or that it will be sufficiently active or liquid to allow shareholders to easily dispose of their shares. Even if a market does develop there is no guarantee that you will be able to sell your stock for the same amount you originally paid for it. Our failure to be listed on an exchange or NASDAQ would make trading our shares more difficult for investors. It may also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Further, we may also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. Note: In addition to the above risks, businesses are often subject to risks not foreseen or fully appreciated by management. In reviewing this Prospectus potential investors should keep in mind other possible risks that could be important. (2) We have no experience as a public company. We have never operated as a public company. We have no experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. In addition, we will be required to spend significant resources to comply with the various rules and regulations of the Securities Act and Exchange Act applicable to public reporting companies. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us. (3) Future sales of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock may depress our stock price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Effective February 15, 2008, the SEC adopted revisions to Rule 144. Under the newly adopted revisions: · the holding period for restricted shares of our common stock after the completion of this offering has been reduced to six months under specified circumstances. · the restrictions on the sale of restricted shares of our common stock held by affiliates and non-affiliates of ours has been reduced; and · certain other restrictions on resale of the shares of our common stock under Rule 144 were modified to make it easier for our stockholders under specified circumstances to sell their shares. (4) Our executive officers are in a position to substantially control matters requiring a stockholder vote. As of the date of this prospectus, our executive officers beneficially owned all of our outstanding common stock. As a result, if they vote together, they may have the ability to control the outcome on all matters requiring stockholder approval including, but not limited to, the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or 10 substantially all of our assets. They also have the ability to control our management and affairs. (5) If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. As of the date of this prospectus, our executive officers beneficially owned all of our outstanding common stock. As a result, if they vote together, they may have the ability to control the outcome on all matters requiring stockholder approval including, but not limited to, the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. They also have the ability to control our management and affairs. (6) We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The continued expansion of our business may require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to do so in the future would be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, if you purchase shares in this offering, realization of a gain on our investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock. (7) Applicable SEC rules governing the trading of Penny Stocks limit the liquidity of our common stock, which may affect the trading price of our common stock. Our common stock is currently not quoted in any market. If our common stock becomes quoted, we anticipate that it will trade below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock is considered a penny stock and is subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded. These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock and the associated risks. Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the written purchasers agreement to a transaction prior to purchase. These regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and redu cing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock.. (8) Issuances of our stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, if a public trading market develops. We have the authority to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue securities convertible or exercisable for shares of our common stock without stockholder approval. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our business operations. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution. The issuance of preferred stock by our board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. An issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock. Our board of directors' authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS When used in this Prospectus, the words or phrases will likely result, we expect, will continue, anticipate, estimate, project, outlook, could, would, may, or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. 11 Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, success in reaching target markets for products in a highly competitive market and the ability to attract future customers, the size and timing of additional significant orders and their fulfillment, the success of our business emphasis, the ability to finance and sustain operations, the ability to raise equity capital in the future despite, and the size and timing of additional significant orders and their fulfillment. We have no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements. Factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include without limitation: · Lack of demand for our products and services; · Competitive products and pricing; · Limited amount of resources devoted to advertising and marketing; · Competitive pressures in the marketing industry; · General conditions in the economy and capital markets. USE OF PROCEEDS We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered through this prospectus by the Selling Shareholders. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Market for Securities There is presently no public market for our common stock. The offering price has been arbitrarily determined and does not bear any relationship to our assets, results of operations, or book value, or to any other generally accepted criteria of valuation. The factors considered were our relatively short operating history and the price we believe a purchaser is willing to pay for our shares. We cannot assure you that an active or orderly trading market will develop for our common stock or that our common stock will trade in the public markets subsequent to this offering at or above the offering price. We intend to request a registered broker-dealer to apply to have our common stock listed on the OTC Bulletin Board upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. However, we can provide no assurance that our shares will be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or, if traded, that a public market will materialize. Penny Stock Regulations The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Secu rities' laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Securities and Exchange Commission shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its 12 salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a suitably written statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, if our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, Shareholders may have difficulty selling those securities. Holders of Our Common Stock As of May 15, 2009 we had 22,205,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and approximately 31 stockholders of record of our common stock. Rule 144 Shares Other than the shares being offered for resale by the Selling Shareholders named in this prospectus, none of shares of our common stock are available for resale to the public. Under Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned shares of a Company's common stock for a specified period is entitled to sell within any three month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of: 1. One percent of the number of shares of the company's common stock then outstanding; or 2. The average weekly trading volume of the company's common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on form 144 with respect to the sale. Rule 144 amendments set forth in the SECs Final Rule Release No. 33-8869, effective as of February 15, 2008, shortened the holding period for resale of Rule 144 restricted stock to six-months under specified circumstances. Also, restrictions on the sale of restricted shares held by affiliates and non-affiliates have been reduced, and certain other restrictions on resale of shares under Rule 144 were modified to make it easier for stockholders under specified circumstances to sell their shares. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to provisions related to the manner of sale, to notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about the company. Dividend Policy The payment by us of dividends, if any, in the future rests within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. We have not paid any dividends since our inception and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but intend to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors we describe under "Risk Factors," "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and elsewhere in this prospectus. 13 Liquidity and Capital Resources. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we had total assets of $226,461. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we had total assets of $321,537, compared to total assets in 2006 of $375,027. The decreases in assets for the 12 months of 2008 and for the 12 months of 2007 were mainly due to a decrease in accounts receivable. At December 31, 2008, we had current liabilities of $30,735 which was represented by accounts payable and line of credit. At December 31, 2007, we had current liabilities of $51,532. At December 31, 2006 we had current liabilities of $36,321. Prior to the merger with Confident on October 27, 2008, Ram had no operations and nominal assets. For accounting purposes, we treated our acquisition of Confident as a recapitalization of our Company. As a result, we treat the historical financial information of Confident as our historical financial information. Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance the costs of our operations. To date, we have financed our business operations through factoring accounts receivable and loans from officers, directors and family. We believe we will have adequate liquidity through the next twelve months to operate our business and to meet our cash requirements. We do not believe that our current cash resources will be able to maintain our current operations for an extended period of time. We will be required to raise additional funds or arrange for additional financing over the next 12 months to adhere to our business plan which will require the financing of additional account receivables. No assurance can be given, however, that we will have access to additional cash in the future, or that funds will be available on acceptable terms to satisfy our working capital requirements. If we are not able to arrange for additional funding or if our officers, directors and shareholders stop advancing funds to us, we may be forced to make other arrangements for financing such as loans or entering into strategic alliances. We have not identified any alternative sources of financing. Results of Operations We realized revenue from operations for the 12 months of 2008 of $1,408,134. We realized revenue from operations in the twelve months of 2007 of $1,735,730. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the net loss from operations was $95,096. A major reason for the loss was the slow pay of certain customers who were not receiving timely reimbursements by the State of California. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the net gains from operations was $56,666 (2006 - $3,302). Increased expenses in 2008 was due primarily to expenses in going public. From January 1, 2005 (inception) to December 31, 2008, the Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $112,172 Our Plan of Operation for the Next Twelve Months The Company plans to open at least two more offices in Nevada in the next twelve months. We also plan to expand our services in California from our two present offices. Many hospitals and healthcare facilities are operating now with skeleton permanent staff, and are therefore using a higher proportion of contract nurses. This will make it easier to meet our growth projections. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Organizational History Confident Care Services, Inc. was incorporated in January 2005 by Johnpaul (Jay) Riddles. It was established to provide nurse and healthcare professional staffing for hospitals and healthcare facilities. In October 2008, Confident was merged into Ram Financial Corporation (Ram), a public company. The merger was a reverse merger transaction in which Ram was the surviving corporation. Ram then changed its name to Confident Care Services, Inc. The Company has spent the past nearly four years expanding the services it performs and expanding its customer 14 base. Currently the Company provides nurse staffing to over eighty clients in California with over eighty RNs, Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurses, Certified Nursing Assistants, unlicensed Home Care Providers and Occupational/Physical Therapists on its staff. Staffing is provided to hospitals, rehabilitation centers, skilled nursing facilities and residential settings. The Company recently opened its first office in Nevada. The Company has emphasized personal and fast service in providing staffing for its clients needs. Confident has earned the trust of its clients. The Company has a unique Internet based system for placing its nurses efficiently and quickly. The medical industry has increased its out-sourcing of various operations significantly over time including its staffing of nurses and other healthcare professionals in an effort to reduce costs and increase flexibility. This has created a market for outside vendors who can offer less expensive labor and more flexibility to the hospitals and healthcare facilities. The Company has positioned itself to take advantage of this growing market. The Company believes it can readily increase its staff as needed because it offers nurses and other healthcare professionals schedule flexibility, higher pay per hour than full-time positions, and daily pay through a credit card service. Business Objectives The primary objective of the Company is to provide the medical industry with an inexpensive, flexible means of meeting its staffing needs at any time. Staffing services include Registered Nurses (RNs), Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurses (LPNs/LVNs), Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), unlicensed Home Care Providers and Occupational/Physical Therapists. The Companys growth objective is to expand in California, where it has an office in Southern California and an office in Northern California, and in Nevada, where it has an office in Las Vegas, It then plans to expand into Arizona and other western states as opportunities arise. Market Strategy The Companys marketing strategy is to systematically promote our capabilities and our outstanding past performance to hospitals and healthcare facilities. We generally make personal visits to potential clients within 50 miles of our offices to introduce ourselves and explain why our clients prefer our services to those offered by competitors. Over the next year, we will target expansion in those cities which we already serve as well as target expansion to other population centers in California, Nevada and Arizona. The Company markets directly to hospitals and other health care facilities within reasonable compute of its offices. We stress our service and quick response to requests for nurses and other health care professionals. The CEO of the Company does most of the marketing through direct contact. We have approximately 80 customers, and we do not rely on one customer for more than 20% of our revenue. Competition The Company competes in a competitive medical services industry. Competitors include AMN Healthcare, Maxim Healthcare, Medical Staffing Network and other companies. Because of the Companys experience and outstanding past performance, we have and expect to continue to compete very well against other companies. Our competitiveness is enhanced by our unique Internet based, contract staffing software which we developed for internal staff management, shift tracking, data base management, and reporting. This has significantly improved our efficiency. Description of Property The Company does not own any real property. The Company leases three small offices in Las Vegas, Nevada; San Diego, California; and Oroville, California. EMPLOYEES 15 The Company has three executive employees, two operations employees and one administrative/clerical employee. None are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Pursuant to Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, any securities not outstanding which are subject to warrants, rights or conversion privileges exercisable within 60 days are deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding securities of the class owned by such person but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage of any other person. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES General Under our Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue an aggregate of 110,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 100,000,000 are shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock and 10,000,000 are preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, 22,205,000 shares of our common stock are issued and outstanding, and there are 31 holders of record of our Common Stock. Common Stock Holders of Common Shares of the Company are entitled to cast one vote for each share held at all shareholders meetings for all purposes, including the election of directors, and to share equally on a per share basis in such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore. Upon liquidation or dissolution, each outstanding Common Share will be entitled to share equally in the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to shareholders after the payment of all debts and other liabilities. Common Shares are not redeemable, have no conversion rights and carry no preemptive or other rights to subscribe to or purchase additional Common Shares in the event of a subsequent offering. All outstanding Common Shares are, and the shares offered hereby will be when issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The Common Shares have no cumulative voting rights. There is no active market for our common stock. Currently, there is no active trading market for our common stock. Following the effectiveness of this registration statement, we intend to request that a broker-dealer/market maker submit an application to make a market for our common stock shares on the OTC Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance, however, that the application will be accepted or that any trading market will ever develop or be maintained on the OTC Bulletin Board, pink sheets or any other recognized trading market or exchange. Any trading market that may develop in the future for our common stock will most likely be very volatile, and numerous factors beyond our control may have a significant effect on the market. Only companies that report their current financial information to the SEC may have their securities included on the OTC Bulletin Board. Therefore, only upon the effective date of this registration statement will our commons tock become eligible to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Boa rd. In the event that we lose our status as a "reporting issuer," any future quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board may be jeopardized. Preferred Stock The Preferred Stock authorized may be issued with such rights, preferences and privileges, and issued in such series, as are determined by the Company's Board of Directors. Each outstanding share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had an original purchase price and has a liquidation preference of $100. Each outstanding share of Preferred Stock is convertible into ten shares of Common Stock at any time after December 31, 2006. All shares of Common Stock, when issued and fully paid upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock, would be non-assessable and would not be subject to redemption or conversion, nor would they have conversion rights. The preferred shares have voting rights equal to twenty shares of common stock. 19 In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company. Although 1,400,000 shares of preferred stock are currently issued and outstanding, we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock, no assurance can be given that it will not do so in the future. Dividend Policy The Registrant has never paid a cash dividend. It is the present policy of the Registrant to retain any extra profits to finance growth and development of the business. Therefore, the Registrant does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. Share Purchase Warrants We have not issued and do not have outstanding any warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Options We do not have a stock option plan in place nor are there any outstanding exercisable for shares of our common stock. Convertible Securities We have not issued and do not have outstanding any securities convertible into shares of our common stock or any rights convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock. INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES Our Bylaws provide that we are required to indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by the Nevada General Corporation Law, provided that the person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the best interests of the Company. We have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel, submit the question of whether such indemnification is against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

The bylaws require us to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Each such person will be indemnified in any proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests. The indemnification would cover expenses, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement. Our bylaws also provide that we may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any of our present or past directors or officers insuring against any liability asserted against such person incurred in their capacity as a director or officer or a rising out of such status, whether or not we would have the power to indemnify such person. < /P> We have no other indemnification provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or otherwise specifically providing for indemnification of directors, officers and controlling persons against liability under the Securities Act. ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES The following recent sales were made: 11,000,000 Common shares for acquisition of Confident Care Services, Inc. in a reverse merger transaction and 205,000 Common shares to two investors. The consideration for the 11,000,000 shares was 100% of the shares of Confident Care Services, Inc. The aggregate price for the other shares was $52,500 based on negotiated prices. The Company sold these shares of common stock under the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, afforded the Company under Section 4(2) and Regulation D promulgated thereunder due to the fact that the issuance did not involve a public offering and in light of fact that Mr. Riddles and the purchasing shareholders are accredited investors as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. 25 ITEM 16.

CONFIDENT CARE SERVICES, INC. By: /s/ John Paul Riddles In accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, this registration statement was signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates stated.

Financial Statements for the years ending December 31, 2006 & 2007 by John Kinross-Kennedy Certified Public Accountant Irvine, California April 11, 2009 29 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To: the Board of Directors and Shareholders Confident Care Services Inc. 502 North Division Street Carson City, Nevada 92684 I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Confident Care Services, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the related statements of operations and of cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. In my opinion, based on my audit, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Confident Care Services Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company had losses in 2005, when it started in the healthcare staffing business. Should the Company have losses again, this would raise substantive doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of the effectiveness of its documented internal controls over financial reporting . /s/ John Kinross-Kennedy John Kinross-Kennedy Certified Public Accountant Irvine, California April 11, 2009 30 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2006 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES Description of business and history  Confident Care Services, Inc., Nevada corporation, (hereinafter referred to as the Company or Confident) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 1989 as Ram Financial Corporation (Ram). The company was originally in the financial services business. In October 2008, Ram was merged with Confident Care Services, Inc. in a reverse merger transaction in which Ram was the surviving corporation. Ram then changed its name to Confident Care Services, Inc. (Confident). Prior to the merger, the original Confident Care Services, Inc. had been in business for four years and provided healthcare professional staffing for hospitals and healthcare facilities in California. The Company is in the process of expanding in California and Nevada. Management of Company  The Company's executives have combined experience in the medical industry of more than thirty years. The CEO is Johnpaul Riddles who started his medical career serving in the United States Navy as a Corpsman for five years. The President is Douglas Tallant who owned and operated physical therapy clinics in Denver and Oklahoma City for more than five years. Going concern  The Company had a net income of $3,302 in 2006 on revenues of $2,017,000, but incurred net losses of approximately $73,742 from the period of December 15, 1989 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2006 on revenues of approximately $3,500.000. Should the company have losses again as it did during 2005 when it started in the healthcare staffing business, there would be substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on additional sources of capital and the success of the Companys plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Year end  The Companys yearend is December 31. Principles of consolidation  Ram Financial and Confident Care Services merged, and one is not a subsidiary of the other. Therefore, there is no need for consolidated financial 35 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICES, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) statements. However, the accounts of the merged companies have been combined in the financial statements presented with these Notes. Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Property and equipment  The Company has no significant property or equipment. Income taxes  The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Management feels the Company will have a net operating loss carryover to be used for future years. Such losses may not be fully deductible due to the significant amounts of non-cash service costs. The Company has not established a valuation allowance for the full tax benefit of the operating loss carryovers due to the uncertainty regarding realization. Net gain/loss per common share  The Company computes net gain/loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share (SFAS 128) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 (SAB 98). Under the provisions of SFAS 128 and SAB 98, basic net gain/loss per share is computed by dividing the net gain/loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net gain/loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is antidilutive. For the period from December 15, 1989 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2006, no options and warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be antidilutive. 36 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICES, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company had no stock-based compensation during 2006. Concentration of risk  A significant amount of the Companys assets and resources are currently dependent on the financial support of Johnpaul Riddle. Should he determine to no longer finance the operations of the company before new capital is raised, it may be unlikely for the company to continue. Revenue recognition  The Company has had revenues of $3,512,494 to date from its operations. Revenue is recognized as it is received. Inventory valuation  At this time the Company is not expected to hold inventory. Legal Procedures  The Company is not aware of, nor is it involved in any pending legal proceedings. New accounting pronouncements  In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handing costs, and spoilage. This statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal" which was the criterion specified in ARB No. 43. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. This pronouncement is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2005. The Company expects no impact on adopting this new standard. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004). Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, 37 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICES, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company expects the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 "effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 153 requires that exchanges of productive assets be accounted for at fair value unless fair value cannot be reasonably determined or the transaction lacks commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material effect on the company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application of the direct effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements where it is practicable to do so. SFAS 154 also redefines the term restatement to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal ye ars beginning after December 15, 2005 unless adopted early. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except to the extent that the statement subsequently requires retrospective application of a future item. In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS No. 155), which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS No. 140). SFAS No. 155 permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or hybrid 38 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICES, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. We expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS No. 156), which amends FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 140). SFAS 156 may be adopted as early as January 1, 2006, for calendar year-end entities, provided that no interim financial statements have been issued. Those not choosing to early adopt are required to apply the provisions as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006 (e.g., January 1, 2007, for calendar year-end entities). The intention of the new statement is to simplify accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities, such as those common with mortgage securitization activities, as well as to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like accounting. Specifically, the FASB said FAS No. 156 permits a servicer using derivative financi al instruments to report both the derivative financial instrument and related servicing asset or liability by using a consistent measurement attribute, or fair value. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 2. FIXED ASSETS The Company has no significant fixed assets. Its furniture and computers were donated. 3.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES Description of business and history  Confident Care Services, Inc., Nevada corporation, (hereinafter referred to as the Company or Confident) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 1989 as Ram Financial Corporation (Ram). The company was originally in the financial services business. In October 2008, Ram was merged with Confident Care Services, Inc. in a reverse merger transaction in which Ram was the surviving corporation. Ram then changed its name to Confident Care Services, Inc. (Confident). Prior to the merger, the original Confident Care Services, Inc. had been in business for four years and provided healthcare professional staffing for hospitals and healthcare facilities in California. The Company is in the process of expanding in California and Nevada. Management of Company  The Company's executives have combined experience in the medical industry of more than thirty years. The CEO is Johnpaul Riddles who started his medical career serving in the United States Navy as a Corpsman for five years. The President is Douglas Tallant who owned and operated physical therapy clinics in Denver and Oklahoma City for more than five years. Going concern  The Company had a net income of $56,666 in 2007 on revenues of $1,735,000, but incurred net losses of approximately $17,076 from the period of December 15, 1989 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2007 on revenues of over $5,000.000. Should the company have losses again as it did during 2005 when it started in the healthcare staffing business, there would be substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on additional sources of capital and the success of the Companys plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Year end  The Companys yearend is December 31. 46 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Principles of consolidation  Ram Financial and Confident Care Services merged, and one is not a subsidiary of the other. Therefore, there is no need for consolidated financial statements. However, the accounts of the merged companies have been combined in the financial statements presented with these Notes. Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Property and equipment  The Company has no significant property or equipment. Income taxes  The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Management feels the Company will have a net operating loss carryover to be used for future years. Such losses may not be fully deductible due to the significant amounts of non-cash service costs. The Company has not established a valuation allowance for the full tax benefit of the operating loss carryovers due to the uncertainty regarding realization. Net gain/loss per common share  The Company computes net gain/loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share (SFAS 128) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 (SAB 98). Under the provisions of SFAS 128 and SAB 98, basic net gain/loss per share is computed by dividing the net gain/loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net gain/loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is antidilutive. For the period from December 15, 1989 (Date of Inception) through 47 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) December 31, 2007, no options and warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be antidilutive. Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company had no stock-based compensation during 2007. Concentration of risk  A significant amount of the Companys assets and resources are currently dependent on the financial support of Johnpaul Riddle. Should he determine to no longer finance the operations of the company before new capital is raised, it may be unlikely for the company to continue. Revenue recognition  The Company has had revenues of $5,248,224 to date from its operations. Revenue is recognized as it is received. Inventory valuation  At this time the Company is not expected to hold inventory. Legal Procedures  The Company is not aware of, nor is it involved in any pending legal proceedings. New accounting pronouncements  In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handing costs, and spoilage. This statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal" which was the criterion specified in ARB No. 43. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. This pronouncement is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2005. The Company expects no impact on adopting this new standard. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004). Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 48 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company expects the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 "effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 153 requires that exchanges of productive assets be accounted for at fair value unless fair value cannot be reasonably determined or the transaction lacks commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material effect on the company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application of the direct effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements where it is practicable to do so. SFAS 154 also redefines the term restatement to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal ye ars beginning after December 15, 2005 unless adopted early. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except to the extent that the statement subsequently requires retrospective application of a future item. In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS No. 155), which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS No. 140). SFAS No. 155 permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that 49 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) otherwise would require bifurcation, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or hybrid financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. We expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS No. 156), which amends FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 140). SFAS 156 may be adopted as early as January 1, 2006, for calendar year-end entities, provided that no interim financial statements have been issued. Those not choosing to early adopt are required to apply the provisions as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006 (e.g., January 1, 2007, for calendar year-end entities). The intention of the new statement is to simplify accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities, such as those common with mortgage securitization activities, as well as to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like accounting. Specifically, the FASB said FAS No. 156 permits a servicer using derivative financi al instruments to report both the derivative financial instrument and related servicing asset or liability by using a consistent measurement attribute, or fair value. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 2. FIXED ASSETS The Company has no significant fixed assets. Its furniture and computers were donated. 3.

Should the company continue to have losses, there would be substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on additional sources of capital and the success of the Companys plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Year end  The Companys yearend is December 31. 58 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Principles of consolidation  Ram Financial and Confident Care Services merged, and one is not a subsidiary of the other. Therefore, there is no need for consolidated financial statements. However, the accounts of the merged companies have been combined in the financial statements presented with these Notes. Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Property and equipment  The Company has no significant property or equipment. Income taxes  The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Management feels the Company will have a net operating loss carryover to be used for future years. Such losses may not be fully deductible due to the significant amounts of non-cash service costs. The Company has not established a valuation allowance for the full tax benefit of the operating loss carryovers due to the uncertainty regarding realization. Net gain/loss per common share  The Company computes net gain/loss per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share (SFAS 128) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 (SAB 98). Under the provisions of SFAS 128 and SAB 98, basic net gain/loss per share is computed by dividing the net gain/loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net gain/loss per share gives effect 59 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is antidilutive. For the period from December 15, 1989 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 2007, no options and warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be antidilutive. Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company had no stock-based compensation during 2008. Concentration of risk  A significant amount of the Companys assets and resources are currently dependent on the financial support of Johnpaul Riddle. Should he determine to no longer finance the operations of the company before new capital is raised, it may be unlikely for the company to continue. Revenue recognition  The Company has had revenues of $6,656,358 to date from its operations. Revenue is recognized as it is received. Inventory valuation  At this time the Company is not expected to hold inventory. Legal Procedures  The Company is not aware of, nor is it involved in any pending legal proceedings. New accounting pronouncements  In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handing costs, and spoilage. This statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal" which was the criterion specified in ARB No. 43. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. This pronouncement is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2005. The Company expects no impact on adopting this new standard. 60 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004). Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company expects the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 "effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 153 requires that exchanges of productive assets be accounted for at fair value unless fair value cannot be reasonably determined or the transaction lacks commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material effect on the company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application of the direct effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements where it is practicable to do so. SFAS 154 also redefines the term restatement to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal ye ars beginning after December 15, 2005 unless adopted early. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except to the extent that the statement subsequently requires retrospective application of a future item. In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155, 61 CONFIDENT CARE SERVICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS No. 155), which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS No. 140). SFAS No. 155 permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or hybrid financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. We expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial po sition, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS No. 156), which amends FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 140). SFAS 156 may be adopted as early as January 1, 2006, for calendar year-end entities, provided that no interim financial statements have been issued. Those not choosing to early adopt are required to apply the provisions as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006 (e.g., January 1, 2007, for calendar year-end entities). The intention of the new statement is to simplify accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities, such as those common with mortgage securitization activities, as well as to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like accounting. Specifically, the FASB said FAS No. 156 permits a servicer using derivative financi al instruments to report both the derivative financial instrument and related servicing asset or liability by using a consistent measurement attribute, or fair value. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 2.
