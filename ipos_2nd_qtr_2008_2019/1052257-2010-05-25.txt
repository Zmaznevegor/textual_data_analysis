SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, Dated May 25, 2010, PROSPECTUS - ------------------ Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC. COMMON STOCK ------------------ This prospectus relates to the sale or other disposition of 643,728 shares of our common stock par value $0.00005 per share and 17,738,463 shares of our common stock underlying convertible notes and warrants by the Selling Shareholders named in this prospectus or their transferees. In private placements effected in 2009 and 2010, we issued 8% convertible promissory notes due in 2011 and 2012. Of the aggregate amount issued we are including shares issuable on conversion of notes in the aggregate amount of $5,281,000 (the “2009 Notes”) and in 2009, 2008, and 2007 we issued warrants in a series of private placements. This prospectus may be used by the Selling Stockholders named herein to resell, from time to time, any shares of our common stock, issuable upon conversion of the 2009 Notes at an initial conversion rate of 10,000 shares per $10,000 principal amount and upon exercise of the warrants at exercise prices ranging from $13.69 to $0.01 per share. The issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not covered by this prospectus; only the resale of the shares underlying the warrants is covered. For information about the Selling Shareholders see the section entitled: “SELLING SHAREHOLDERS” on page 30. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of any shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus. However, we will receive the proceeds from any cash exercise of the Warrants. The Selling Shareholders may offer their shares of Common Stock from time to time through public or private transactions, on or off of the OTC Bulletin Board at prevailing market prices or at privately negotiated prices. Our common stock is quoted on the regulated quotation service of the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “ZTHO.” The last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board on May 12, 2010 was $1.10 per share .

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders, but will receive proceeds related to the exercise for cash of warrants held by the Selling Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders, and any participating broker-dealers may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, and any commissions or discounts given to any such broker-dealer may be regarded as underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The Selling Shareholders have informed us that they do not have any agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute their common stock.

We have not authorized any dealer or other person to provide you with additional or different information. If anyone provides you with different or inconsistent information, you should not rely on it. This prospectus is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities other than the securities to which it relates and is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make an offer or solicitation in that jurisdiction.

This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, utilizing a “shelf” registration process or continuous offering process. Under this shelf registration process, the selling security holders may, from time to time, sell the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. This prospectus provides you with a description of the securities that may be offered by the selling security holders. Each time a selling security holder sells securities, the selling security holder is required to provide you with this prospectus and, in certain cases, a prospectus supplement containing specific information about the selling security holder and the terms of the offering. Any prospectus supplement may add, update, or change information in this prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in that prospectus supplement. Additional information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, is incorporated in this prospectus by reference to our reports filed with the SEC. Please read “Where You Can Find More Information.” You are urged to read this prospectus carefully, including the “Risk Factors,” and our SEC reports in their entirety before investing in our securities.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus, as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us and our representatives in other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, may be deemed forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Report Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential” and similar expressions as they relate to us and our management also identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results, as well as our expectations regarding materiality or significance, to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to our history of operating losses, lack of significant market acceptance of our product, the fact that we will need to raise additional capital, and our reliance on intellectual property. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified herein under “RISK FACTORS” and elsewhere including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, our subsequent SEC filings and those factors summarized below. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, and any events anticipated in the forward-looking statements may not actually occur. Consequently we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Except as required by law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus to conform those statements to actual results or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. We qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus by the foregoing cautionary statements. Other factors besides those described in this prospectus, any prospectus supplement or the documents we incorporate by reference herein could also affect our actual results. These forward-looking statements are largely based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events, which reflect estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions and other factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe our estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate. We caution you that the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus are not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure you that those statements will be realized or the forward-looking events and circumstances will occur. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this prospectus. We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. 1 PROSPECTUS SUMMARY The following summary does not contain all the information that may be important to you and is qualified in its entirety by more detailed information appearing elsewhere in, or incorporated by reference into, this prospectus. You should read the entire prospectus, paying particular attention to the risks referred to under the heading “Risk Factors,” request from us all additional public information that you wish to review relating to us and complete your own examination of us before making an investment decision . THE COMPANY Z Trim Holdings, Inc. deploys technology, formulation, and product performance solutions built around cutting-edge dietary fibers for both domestic and international food markets. Z Trim ® multifunctional fiber ingredients originated from a USDA patent for minimally processed, non-caloric functional food ingredients made from healthy dietary fiber. With an exclusive license from the USDA, this patent is central to the company’s intellectual property portfolio. Z Trim Holdings subsequently evolved the processing technology and expanded the fiber sources to create innovative ingredients with unique properties that provide multifunctional benefits that help create value for food manufacturers around the world. Currently, Z Trim is made from corn and oat, but it can be produced from virtually any cellulose, the substance that makes up most of a plant’s cell walls, and is one of the most abundant organic compounds on earth. Z Trim Holdings operates within global business of food additives, which, as of 2006 was a $25 billion industry. The global hydrocolloid business - which consists of agents used for thickening, gelling and stabilizing food and beverage products is over $19 billion per year ( http://www.sriconsulting.com/CEH/Public/Reports/582.7000/ ) with food applications constituting approximately $4.2 billion of that total (http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Financial-Industry/Health-and-prices-dominate-hydrocolloids-debate). Specifically, the U.S. fat replacer and bulk dietary fiber (supplement) markets are estimated to be just over $500 million each, with carbohydrate-based fat replacers such as Z Trim accounting for approximately 59 percent of the market in 2000 ( http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-top.pag?docid=10039518 ). Presently, the Company employs 25 full-time employees and one part-time employee. Corporate Information Z Trim Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Illinois on May 5, 1994 under the original name Circle Group Entertainment Ltd. The Company has no operating subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 1011 Campus Drive, Mundelein, Illinois, 60060. Our phone number is (847) 549-6002. Our website is www.ztrim.com.

AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS PROSPECTUS AND INFORMATION IN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING THE COMPANY. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MAY ALSO ADVERSELY IMPAIR THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD LIKELY SUFFER SIGNIFICANTLY AND COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN SUCH CASE, THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. BUSINESS RISKS THE COMPANY HAS A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES AND CANNOT GUARANTEE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. ANY FAILURE ON OUR PART TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY MAY CAUSE US TO REDUCE OR EVENTUALLY CEASE OPERATIONS. The Company incurred a net loss of $748,380 for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, $12,209,580 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2009, and had an accumulated deficit of $86,750,786 at March 31, 2010 and $86,002,406 at December 31, 2009. The Company reported a net loss of $7,416,927 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company reported an accumulated deficit of $71,662,875. If the Company continues to incur significant losses, our cash reserves may be depleted earlier than currently anticipated, and the Company may be required to cease operations or limit our future growth objectives to levels corresponding with our then available cash reserves. OUR AUDITORS HAVE EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT REGARDING OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. As of the date of our most recent audit, which included the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, we had not generated sufficient revenues to meet our cash flow needs. As a result, our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Although we have generated revenue, we are still operating at a net loss, and may continue to incur losses for a period of time. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds from our operating or financing activities to support our continued operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern, we may need to substantially revise our business plan or cease operations, which may reduce or negate the value of your investment. WE FACE LIQUIDITY ISSUES. OUR 8% CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED IN 2008 IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $4,457,000 WILL COME DUE IN 2010 As of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, we had a cash balance of $564,766 and $324,784. Over the last several years, we have been funding our operations through the sale of both equity and debt securities. In 2008, we sold $4,457,000 in convertible notes. These notes are convertible into our Common Stock at $1.00, per share and bear interest at 8% per year (See Note 8 to our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein). The 2008 Notes come due in 2010. The first tranche in the amount of $1,400,000 is due in June and $2,370,000 in September 2010. If our note holders choose not to convert the 2008 Notes as they become due, we will either have to repay the notes, or reach an agreement with the note holders to extend the terms thereof. If we are unable to do either, we will be in default on the 2008 Notes and the 8% Convertible Notes issued in 2009 and 2010 and may face lawsuits from our note holders. In addition, the terms of the Series I Preferred Stock (which are designated but not yet issued) require a deferral of the payment of dividends and mandatory redemption until the 2008 Notes and the 2009 Notes are paid in full. Any extension of the maturity dates on the Notes would not constitute a default under the terms of the Series I Preferred Stock OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCT. The Company has not conducted, nor have others made available to us, results of market research indicating how much market demand exists for Z Trim ingredients. The Company is relying on feedback from current and prospective customers with respect to the many different functions provided by the Z Trim ingredients. We cannot assure you that we will be able to gain the market acceptance necessary to achieve profitability. WE MAKE NO PROJECTIONS REGARDING THE VIABILITY OF OUR FUNCTIONAL FOOD INGREDIENT AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE THE RESULTS DESCRIBED. We make no projection with respect to our future income, assets or business. No expert has reviewed our business plan for accuracy or reasonableness. It is likely that our actual business and results of operations will differ from those presented herein. The underlying USDA patent, to which we have an exclusive license, expires in 2015. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CURRENT REVENUES AND ORDER BOOKINGS WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. Revenues recognized over the past year and order bookings received to date are concentrated with a small number of customers. The loss of one or more of our customers or material changes to the contracts with or payment terms of these customers may result in a significant business interruption through reduced revenues, reduced cash flows, delays in revenues or cash flows and such delays or reductions could have a material impact on the future revenue growth and profitability of the Company. WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND SUCH FUNDING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. IF SUCH FUNDING IS AVAILABLE, IT MAY NOT BE OFFERED ON SATISFACTORY TERMS. We will require additional financing to fund ongoing operations, as our current sales and revenue growth are insufficient to meet our operating costs and perhaps our maturing obligations. Our inability to obtain necessary capital or financing to fund these needs will adversely affect our ability to fund operations and continue as a going concern. Our inability to obtain necessary capital or financing to fund these needs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additional financing may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms acceptable to us. If adequate funds are not available, in addition to being required to delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of our business strategies, which may affect our overall business results of operations and financial condition our ability to continue as a going concern may be affected. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REDUCE ACCESS TO CREDIT AND CAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS TO SUFFER FINANCIAL HARDSHIP, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS. Economic conditions have recently deteriorated significantly in the United States, and may remain challenging for the foreseeable future. General business and economic conditions that could affect us include short-term and long-term interest rates, unemployment, inflation, fluctuations in debt markets and the strength of the US economy and the local economies in which we operate. There could be a number of other effects from these economic developments on our business, including reduced demand for products; insolvency of our customers, resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations and counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations. 3 OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT A LOSS. We are presently operating at a negative gross margin in that the cost of production exceeds the sales price of the product. The changes that are being made to the manufacturing process to allow us to produce at a positive gross margin have yet to be completed and may not be successful. The current manufacturing facility is merely a pilot plant. In order to fully implement our business plans we will need to move the operations to a larger facility, develop strategic partnerships or find other means to produce greater volumes of finished product. WE RELY UPON A LIMITED NUMBER OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS. The majority of the products that we have sold as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 have been based on corn and oat. Although we will market our products, as an active food ingredient for inclusion in other companies’ products, and in other ways, a decline in the market demand for our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us. THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO WEATHER AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. All of our current products depend on our proprietary technology using agricultural products, mainly corn and oat. Historically, the costs of corn and oat are subject to substantial fluctuations depending upon a number of factors which affect commodity prices in general and over which the Company has no control, including crop conditions, weather, government programs and purchases by foreign governments. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We currently do not hedge against changes in commodity prices. THE COMPANY IS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES; ANY OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF THE COMPANY’S SALES VOLUMES AND COULD CAUSE IT TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES. The Company’s revenues are and will continue to be derived from the sale of functional food ingredient made from dietary fiber that the Company’s manufactures at its facility. The Company’s operations may be subject to significant interruption if its facility experiences a major accident or is damaged by severe weather or other natural disasters. In addition, the Company’s operations may be subject to labor disruptions and unscheduled downtime, or other operational hazards inherent in the industry, such as equipment failures, fires, explosions, abnormal pressures, blowouts, pipeline ruptures, transportation accidents and natural disasters. Some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The Company’s insurance may not be adequate to fully cover the potential operational hazards described above or that it will be able to renew this insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all. THE AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE COMPANY’S OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS THAT LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS AND THE COMPANY’S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE DEBT COVENANTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The agreements governing the company’s outstanding convertible notes contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends or redeem any of its outstanding capital stock without prior approval of the note holders. WE FACE COMPETITION. Competition is intense in our targeted industries, including nutraceuticals, functional food ingredients, oils, gums and a large number of businesses engaged in the various fat replacement industries. Many of our competitors have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing their products, including products that are widely recognized as providing similar calorie reduction. In addition, many of our competitors have greater financial, managerial, and technical resources than we have. If we are not successful in competing in these markets, we may not be able to attain our business objectives. OUR INABILITY TO SECURE AND PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY RESULT IN COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING LITIGATION AND COULD IMPEDE US FROM EVER ATTAINING MARKET SUCCESS. We hold several patents, trademarks and copyrights with respect to our products and expect to continue to file applications in the future as a means of protecting our intellectual property. In addition, we seek to protect our proprietary information and know-how through the use of trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other similar security measures. With respect to patents, there can be no assurance that any applications for patent protection will be granted, or, if granted, will offer meaningful protection. The technology employed by Z Trim in its products is licensed to the company by the United States Department of Agriculture. The USDA patent expires 2015. Although the company has additional process patents on file and intends to file a patent for NanoGum in the next few months, there can be no assurance that new patents will in fact issue or that they will provide effective protection. Additionally, there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop, patent or gain access to similar know-how and technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that any confidentiality agreements upon which we rely to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information will be adequate to protect our proprietary technology. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PREVENT DISCLOSURE OF TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. We rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. 4 IF OUR FOOD PRODUCTS BECOME ADULTERATED, MISBRANDED, OR MISLABELED, WE MIGHT NEED TO RECALL THOSE ITEMS AND MAY EXPERIENCE PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS IF CONSUMERS ARE INJURED. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. OUR COMPETITORS MAY DESIGN PRODUCTS AROUND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION. We hold an intellectual property portfolio, including patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection. Our competitors, however, may design around our patent claims, rendering our patent protection ineffective against such competitor. Similarly, our competitors may independently develop technology similar to our trade secrets and technical know-how. Such occurrences could increase competitive pressure on our marketing and sales efforts. OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE VALUABLE, AND ANY INABILITY TO PROTECT THEM COULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND BRAND. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN AVOIDING CLAIMS THAT WE INFRINGE OTHERS’ PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY JUDGMENTS OR LICENSING FEES. Any infringement claim, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming and result in costly litigation, and could require us to discontinue any of our practices that are found to be in violation of another party’s rights. Any failure to maintain rights to our intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products. GOVERNMENT REGULATION We are subject to extensive regulation, and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations may require us to incur substantial expenditures or require us to make product recalls. New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business. We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign agencies. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. In addition, we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations and of new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products. Our operations are also subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, and by various state and local authorities. Such regulation covers virtually every aspect of our operations, including production facilities, marketing, pricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, water usage, waste water discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and omissions and other matters. Violations of any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties being levied against us, permit revocation or modification, performance of environmental investigatory or remedial activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, or a cease and desist order against operations that are not in compliance. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or to affect any product recalls. These matters may have a material adverse effect on our business. IF Z TRIM’S PRODUCTS DO NOT SATISFY CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, Z TRIM MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OR MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN MULTIPLE LICENSES TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS. Z Trim has self-certified that all components of its products are generally recognized as safe or GRAS according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations. A GRAS designation exempts the products from the regulations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, permitting the sale of the products anywhere in the United States without obtaining a license. Should the products lose their GRAS designation, Z Trim will be required to sell the products as feed additives by obtaining a license to sell from each individual state in which sales would occur. There is no assurance that Z Trim would be able to successfully obtain or maintain licenses in all states in which sales are expected to be made or that the cost of obtaining and maintaining these licenses would not limit its ability to sell its products. WE ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC LITIGATION AND OTHER REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF TIME AND RESOURCES. We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business, including litigation brought by former employees. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH COULD IMPACT NEGATIVELY OUR ABILITY TO REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ACCURATELY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable reports our reputation and operating results may be harmed. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2009. We identified three material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, we did not maintain effective control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that we prepare will not be prevented or detected. As a result, we must perform additional work to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves or to integrate acquired businesses into our controls system, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our common stock. 5 MARKET RISKS OUR STOCK IS NO LONGER LISTED ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE AND NOW TRADES IN THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD. Since our common stock is currently traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of our common stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase such stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price. Being a penny stock also could limit the liquidity of our common stock and limit the coverage of our stock by analysts. The OTC Bulletin Board generally provides less liquidity than Amex and the Pink Sheets generally provide less liquidity than the OTC Bulletin Board. Stocks trading on both the OTC Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets may be very thinly traded and highly volatile, and quotations for Pink Sheet companies are generally very difficult to obtain, if available at all. Therefore, should the Company’s stock be quoted on the Pink Sheets, holders of the Company’s common stock may be unable to sell their shares at any price, whether or not such shares have been registered for resale. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common shares, significant sales of our common shares, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our share price to fall. Also, as a result of the Company’s withdrawal from Amex, the Company will not be required to seek, and will, generally, not seek, shareholder approval in connection with its equity offerings. Since our common stock is currently traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of our common stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase such stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price. Being a penny stock also could limit the liquidity of our common stock and limit the coverage of our stock by analysts. THE FLUCTUATION IN OUR STOCK PRICE MAY RESULT IN A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT. The price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including the differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts, changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections, short selling of our stock in the market, changes in general economic or market conditions and broad market fluctuations. Companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities often are subject to securities class action litigation. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET. Certain of our shareholders are and from time to time others may become eligible to sell all or some of their shares of Common Stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, a stockholder, who is not an affiliate of the company and who has satisfied a six-month holding period may, under if there is current information publicly available concerning the company. Rule 144 also permits, the sale of securities, without any conditions, by our shareholders that are non-affiliates that have satisfied a one-year holding period. Any substantial sale of our Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Common Stock. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK, NOTES, WARRANTS AND COMMON STOCK UPON EXERCISE OR CONVERSION COULD RESULT IN PRICE REDUCTIONS IN OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Additional sales of substantial amounts of the Common Stock could reduce the market price for the Common Stock. We will need additional equity funding to provide the capital to achieve our objectives. Such equity issuance would cause a substantially larger number of shares to be outstanding, thereby diluting the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. In addition, public sales of substantial amounts of the Common Stock after this offering could reduce the market price for the Common Stock. If we raise capital in the future by issuing additional equity securities, investors may experience a decline in the value of their securities purchased in this offering. We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of our common stock, of which 3,603,217 shares were outstanding at the close of business on May 10, 2010 , and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which none were outstanding at the close of business on May 10, 2010. The Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to 1 Million shares of the Series I Preferred Stock under certain circumstances. Our Articles of Incorporation (as amended to date) gives our Board of Directors authority to issue the undesignated shares of preferred stock with such designations, rights, preferences and limitations as the Board may determine. At the close of business on May 10,2010 , we had outstanding the 2008 and 2009 Notes convertible into 10,000,000 shares of our common stock (the “Notes”) warrants to purchase an aggregate 11,755,218 shares of our common stock, and outstanding options to purchase approximately 2,976,330 shares of our common stock. At May 1,2010, we also had approximately 16,769,004 shares of our common stock reserved for future stock options under our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan.. At maturity, interest on the 2008 Notes and 2009 Notes (Collectively, the “Notes”) will be convertible into an additional 713,120 and 886,880 shares, respectively. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2009 Notes and 2008 Notes, exercise of the warrants and exercise of outstanding options, or in other transactions would cause dilution of existing stockholders’ percentage ownership of the Company. Holders of our common stock do not have preemptive rights, meaning that current shareholders do not have the right to purchase any new shares in order to maintain their proportionate ownership in the Company. Such stock issuances and the resulting dilution could also adversely affect the price of our common stock. We also entered into registration rights agreements in connection with the 2008 and 2009 private placements pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the warrants issued in connection therewith. On January 6, 2010 the Company was advised that J.P. Turner, the placement agent and former collateral agent for the 2008 Note offering, intended to take the position that as a result of the issuance, by the Company on or about February 9, 2009, of warrants providing for the purchase of the Common Stock of the Company, at an exercise price per share of $0.01 per share (the “Penny Warrants”), the exercise price of the of the warrants issued to J.P. Turner, as partial consideration for its services as placement agent (the “Turner Warrant”), should be adjusted from $1.00 per share to $.01 per share and that the number shares of Common Stock issuable under the warrant should be adjusted to 38 million rather than 685,661 shares. The Penny Warrants were issued to the 2008 Noteholders in consideration for obtaining the Noteholders’ consent to an amendment to the 2008 Notes. The amendment removed a prohibition against any reverse stock split of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Amendment”). The Company issued Penny Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 936,860, shares of its Common Stock. The Company believes that there is no basis for the position being taken by J.P. Turner and that the Turner Warrant expressly provides that there is to be no adjustment under the circumstances of the transaction pursuant to which the Penny Warrants were issued. Section 6(h) of the Turner Warrant provides in relevant part as follows: “(h). No Adjustment of Exercise Price in Certain Cases . No adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made... (iii) Upon the issuance of any shares of capital stock or the grant of warrants or options (or the exercise thereof) as consideration for mergers, acquisitions, strategic alliances and other commercial transactions, other than in connection with a financing transaction.” Emphasis Added. No financing was involved or sought by the Company in connection with the Amendment. The Penny Warrants were issued in consideration for the consents to the Amendment. Although the Company believes that there is no validity to the position being asserted by J.P. Turner there can, of course, be no assurance that the placement agent will not, nonetheless, initiate legal proceedings to pursue and attempt to realize on its claim or any assurance on the ultimate outcome of any such proceeding. RECENTLY, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT IN WHICH A SINGLE PURCHASER, BRIGHTLINE VENTURES I, LLC (“BRIGHTLINE”) ACQUIRED CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND WARRANTS GIVING IT A BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 69% OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK Brightline may have significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the election of directors. Furthermore such concentration of voting power could enable Brightline to delay or prevent another party from taking control of our company even where such change of control transaction might be desirable to other shareholders. OUR STOCK PRICE MAY DROP UNEXPECTEDLY DUE TO SHORT SELLING OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE MARKET. Regulation SHO began on January 3, 2005 and was adopted to update short sale regulation in light of numerous market developments since short sale regulation was first adopted in 1938. We have experienced and may continue to experience unexpected declines in our stock price due to manipulation of the market by individuals who profit by short selling our common stock. Short selling occurs when an individual borrows shares from an investor through a broker and then sells those borrowed shares at the current market price. The “short seller” profits when the stock price falls because he or she can repurchase the stock at a lower price and pay back the person from whom he or she borrowed, thereby making a profit. We cannot assure you that short sellers will not continue to drive the stock price down in the future, causing decline in the value of your investment. 6 THE TRADING PRICE OF THE COMMON STOCK IS VOLATILE, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT OUR SECURITIES TO DECLINE. The market price of shares of our Common Stock has been volatile. The market price of our common stock has in the past been highly volatile. In fiscal year 2008, the price of our common stock traded, at post-reverse split prices, in the range of $14.40 to $0.60 per share; in fiscal 2009, our common stock traded in the range of $2.20 to $0.25 per share. From January 1, 2010 to May 10, 2010, our stock traded in the range of $1.95 to $0.90. This volatility is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Factors affecting potential volatility include:  developments and resolution of current litigation that we are a party to;  our cash resources and our ability to obtain additional funding;  announcements of private or public sales of securities  announcements by us or a competitor of business development or exhibition projects;  our entering into or terminating strategic business relationships;  changes in government regulations;  changes in our revenue or expense levels;  fluctuations in operating results and general economic and other external market factors  negative reports on us by security analysts;  announcements of new products or technologies by us or our competitors. The occurrence of any of these events may cause the price of the Common Stock to fall. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance or financial condition of individual companies. Any broad market or industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock, regardless of operating performance or prospects. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CURRENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RELATED TO STOCK BASED COMPENSATION HAS REDUCED AND MAY CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR REPORTED EARNINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE. As part of our compensation to employees, directors and consultants, we issue equity awards, primarily in the form of stock options, warrants and shares of common stock. Many of the companies within our industry and with whom we compete for skilled employees use stock-based compensation as a means to attract personnel, although not all do and many do not issue the same level of awards. As a result, the impact of the January 1, 2006 implementation of current accounting standards relating to stock based compensation may be more significant for us as compared to other companies. In addition, if we unexpectedly hire additional employees or acquire another company, the impact of the implementation of current accounting standards may be more significant for us than previously forecasted. To the extent investors believe the costs incurred for current accounting standards relating to stock based compensation by the Company are higher than those incurred by other companies, our stock price could be negatively impacted. WE DO NOT PLAN TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends to the holders of the Common Stock at any time. Accordingly, investors must rely upon subsequent sales after price appreciation as the sole method to realize a gain on investment. There are no assurances that the price of Common Stock will ever appreciate in value. Investors seeking cash dividends should not buy our securities. OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES. The term “penny stock” generally refers to low-priced, speculative securities of very small companies. Before a broker-dealer can sell a penny stock, SEC rules require the broker-dealer to first approve the customer for the transaction and receive from the customer a written agreement to the transaction. The broker-dealer must furnish the customer a document describing the risks of investing in penny stocks. The broker-dealer must tell the customer the current market quotation, if any, for the penny stock and the compensation the broker-dealer and its broker will receive for the trade. Finally, the broker-dealer must send monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. These requirements make penny stocks more difficult to trade. Because the Common Stock is subject to the penny stock rules, the market liquidity of the Common Stock may be adversely affected. 7 USE OF PROCEEDS All of the shares of Common Stock offered by this prospectus are being offered by the Selling Shareholders. For information about the Selling Shareholders, see “Selling Shareholders” on page 30 . We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of Common Stock offered by the Selling Shareholders, but will receive proceeds related to the exercise of warrants for cash held by the Selling Shareholders. We intend to use the net proceeds generated by such warrant exercises for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, if any. We cannot estimate how many, if any, warrants and options may be exercised as a result of this offering. We are obligated to bear the expenses of the registration of the shares. We anticipate that these expenses will be approximately $25,000. DIVIDEND POLICY We have not paid, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends is prohibited without the consent of the holders of the Company’s 8% Convertible Notes issued in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The declaration of dividends, if any, will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth the capitalization of the Company as of March 31, 2010. This table should be read in conjunction with the “Selected Financial Operating Data”, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. Actual Shareholders’ equity Preferred stock- Subscription Payable $9,000 Common stock $177 Additional paid-in capital (1) $76,906,256 Accumulated deficit ($86,750,786 ) Total shareholders’ equity (deficit) ($9,835,353) _______________________________ (1) Includes 3,603,217 shares of Common Stock (as of March 31, 2010) issuable upon exercise of stock options outstanding; and 11,755,218 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding . Until such time as the Notes are converted, the convertible notes are treated as short term debt. SELECTED FINANCIAL OPERATING DATA Results of Operations Quarter Ending March 31, 2010 Compared to Quarter Ending March 31, 2009 (Unaudited) Revenues Revenues increased 40.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2010 from $127,969 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 to $180,251 as a result of an increase in product revenues. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to the increase in Z Trim products sales to large food processors. The following table provides a breakdown of the revenues for the periods indicated: Quarter ended March 31, 2010 2009 --------- -------- < /div> Products $ 180,251 $ 127,969 -------------- ------------ Total Revenues $ 180,251 $ 127,969 ========= ======== Operating expenses Operating expenses consist of payroll and related costs, stock option and warrant expense, insurance, occupancy expenses, professional fees, and general operating expenses. Total operating expenses increased by $396,412 to $2,258,886 or 21.3% for the first quarter that ended March 31, 2010 from $1,862,474 for the first quarter that ended March 31, 2009. The increase in operating expenses was due to increases in director fees ($188,000), investor relations expense ($490,000), stock option expense ($141,095) offset by decreases in depreciation expense of $65,000, warrant expense of $231,000 and administrative and officers’ salaries of $59,000. Excluding those non-cash expenses, our operating expenses in the first quarter for 2010 were only approximately $790,000. Comparably, excluding the same non-cash expenses, our operating expenses in the first quarter of 2009 were approximately $898,000. Excluding the non-cash items from our operating expenses is not in accordance with GAAP, and is provided solely to aid in the understanding of our financial performance. The stock based compensation expense and warrant expense for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010 was $684,434 and $0, respectively. The stock based compensation expense and warrant expense for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $543,339 and $230,882, respectively. Other income (expense) Total other income for the first quarter ending on March 31, 2010 was $1,873,677 compared to other expense of $864,671 for the first quarter ending on March 31, 2009. The decrease to other expense was due to the change in the fair value – derivative of $3,823,694 offset by the increase of interest expense of $736,838 and loss on derivatives of $325,928. Net loss The Company incurred a net loss of $748,380 for the first quarter ending on March 31, 2010 or $(.22) per share, compared to the net loss of $2,949,793 for the first quarter ending March 31, 2009 or $(1.13) per share. But for the non cash expenses, the net loss for the first quarter ending on March 31, 2010 would have been $982,364 or $(.29) per share and in 2009 the loss would be $986,121 or $(.38) per share. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents, of $564,766 compared to $104,931 at March 31, 2009. Net cash used by operating activities increased by 362.0% to $(1,107,115) for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 as compared to $(284,658) for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. This increase was due to three main items. First, in the first quarter of 2009, our accounts payable increased by approximately $463,000, due to our lack of cash resources. Comparatively, in the first quarter of 2010, our accounts payable increased by approximately $62,000. This amounts to an increase in use of cash for operating activities of approximately $525,000. Second, we spent $208,000 pre-paying for some equipment we will use to increase our plant capacity and efficiency. Third, we incurred additional operating costs due to the strengthening of our sales and research and development departments since the first quarter of 2009. In these two areas, we spent over $100,000 more in salaries and employment recruitment costs in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009. 8 Net cash used by investing activities was $261,634 for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 as compared to $203,107, inclusive of an offset for proceeds from sale of a fixed asset of $90,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. The increase was due to the higher cost of purchased equipment in 2010 compared to the purchases of equipment in 2009 for our manufacturing plant. Specifically, we spent $208,000 pre-paying for some equipment we will uise to increase our plant capacity and efficiency. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,608,731 for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, and $0 for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. In the first quarter of 2010 we sold $1,596,000 worth of convertible notes. As of March 31, 2010, our cash balance was $564,766. To successfully grow our business, we must improve our cash position through greater and sustainable sales of our product lines, increase the productivity of the production process, as well as raise additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, strategic alliances or debt financing to allow us to make necessary changes to our plant and to provide working capital until we achieve profitability. The Company estimates that it will take from 18 to 30 months to achieve profitability. Given this estimate, the Company will likely need to find sources of funding for both the short and long terms. The Company does not expect or anticipate that its concerns over its ability to continue as a going concern will have any impact on its ability to raise capital from internal and external sources. Results of Operations Year Ending December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ending December 31, 2008 (Audited) Revenues Revenues decreased 22.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $720,889 for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $559,910 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in product revenue was primarily due to the decrease in Z Trim sales to one of our international distributors, resulting from production limitations in the second half of the year. The following table provides a breakdown of the revenues for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 ----------- ------------ Products $559,910 $720,899 ----------- ------------ Total Revenues $559,910 $720,899 ======= ======= Operating expenses Operating expenses consist of payroll and related costs, stock option expense, insurance, occupancy expenses, professional fees, and general operating expenses. Total operating expenses increased by $545,915 or 12.7% to $4,856,334 for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $4,310,419 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in stock option expense of $525,230, warrants expense of $674,240, and investor relations of $440,784 that was partially offset by a decrease in litigation expense of $246,892, audit fees of $ 181,460, directors’ fees of $172,800, impairment of intangibles of $136,668 and Amex registration fees of $111,267. Other income (expense) Total other expense increased by $4,836,221 or 340%, to $6,234,008 for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1,397,787 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in expense in 2009 was due to interest expense (from fund-raising activities) of $2,426,032, a derivative expense of $3,623,519, liquidated damages of $80,100, and a settlement loss of $103,137. Further, in 2008, although there was a settlement loss for $772,202 there was interest expense of $670,042 offset by income of $44,978. Net loss The Company incurred a net loss of $12,209,580 for the year ended December 31, 2009, or $4.48 per share, compared to $7,416,927 for the year ended December 31, 2008 or $2.95 per share. The higher loss was due primarily to the cost of raising funds. Liquidity and Capital Resources Year ending December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ending December 31, 2008 At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $324,784, compared to $592,696 at December 31, 2008. The Company raised $3,196,366 and $3,615,966 in additional capital through equity and convertible debt transactions during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively. Net cash used by operating activities decreased by $1,949,398 or 38.08%, to $3,169,632 for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $5,119,030 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in fees paid to outside professionals (including accountants, auditors and attorneys). Net cash used by investing activities was $294,645 for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $340,820 for the year ending December 31, 2008. The decrease was due to proceeds from asset disposals. The 2008 number does not include pre-payment for equipment that was to be delivered in 2009. Net cash provided by financing activities was $3,196,365 for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $3,615,966 for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily from the net proceeds from the sale of convertible notes and exercise of warrants. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily from the net proceeds from the sale of convertible notes offset by a return of common stock. As of April 5, 2010, our cash balance was approximately $672,764. To successfully grow our business, we must improve our cash position through greater and sustainable sales of our product lines, increase the productivity of the production process, as well as raise additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, strategic alliances or debt financing to allow us to make necessary changes to our plant and to provide working capital until we achieve profitability. The Company estimates that it will take from 16 to 24 months to achieve profitability. Given this estimate, the Company will likely need to find sources of funding for both the short and long terms. 9 MANAGEMENT’ DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED TO ASSIST IN UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC. YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ALONG WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2010 AND BEYOND MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED IN, OR IMPLIED BY, THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. First Fiscal Quarter Ended March 31, 2010 Overview Z Trim is a functional food ingredient company which provides custom product solutions that help answer the food industry’s problems. Z Trim’s revolutionary technology provides value-added ingredients across virtually all food industry categories. Z Trim’s all-natural products, among other things, help to reduce fat and calories, add fiber, provide shelf-stability, prevent oil migration, and add binding capacity – all without degrading the taste and texture of the final food products. Perhaps most significantly, Z Trim’s products can help extend finished products, and thereby increase its customers’ gross margins. Under the direction of new management since December 2007, Z Trim has focused its efforts and resources towards the manufacture, marketing and sales of its industry-changing products. Z Trim, through an exclusive license to technology patented by the United States Department of Agriculture, has developed products that both reduce fat and add fiber, with the added benefit of maintaining taste and mouth-feel associated with full fat products. The global market for Z Trim's line of products spans the entire food and nutritional beverage industry, including fat free, low-fat, reduced fat and full fat, across meats, baked goods, dairy and non-dairy products, snacks, beverages, dressings, sauces and dips. As our current facility is a prototype plant, being the first of its kind to produce our innovative products, we are constantly seeking ways to improve efficiencies and achieve economies of scale. We are currently re-designing the process to make use of newer separation technologies and thereby optimize plant capacity. In order to fully realize the potential of our business model, the Company will eventually need to move to a larger facility, enter into strategic partnerships, or find some other means to produce greater volumes of finished product. Results of Operations In 2010, our revenues increased by 43.8% from 2009. The primary reason behind the increase in sales was our ability to produce more product to meet increasing demand. We are in the process of making material changes to our production process that we believe will be completed by the end of the second quarter in 2010. Specifically, we entered into two lease-to-own contracts for two substantial pieces of equipment that will allow us to increase our manufacturing capacity and lower our costs of goods sold. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2010, our cost of goods sold increased by $192,805 or 55% to $543,422 in 2010 from $350,617 in 2009. This increase was due primarily to increases in production as well as increases in direct labor, supervisor costs, utility cost, product analysis and testing, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation. Significantly, cash flows used in operating activities increased by $1,030,457or 362.0%, to $1,315,115 for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 as compared to $284,658 for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. This increase was due to three main items. First, in the first quarter of 2009, our accounts payable increased by approximately $463,000, due to our lack of cash resources. Comparatively, in the first quarter of 2010, our accounts payable increased by approximately $62,000. This amounts to an increase in use of cash for operating activities of approximately $525,000. Second, we spent $208,000 pre-paying for some equipment we will use to increase our plant capacity and efficiency. Third, we incurred additional operating costs due to the strengthening of our sales and research and development departments since the first quarter of 2009. In these two areas, we spent over $100,000 more in salaries and employment recruitment costs in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009. Additionally, we have reduced our accounts payable by $61,866 during the first quarter of 2010. On December 31, 2009, we had a total of $373,841 in accounts payable. On March 31, 2010 we had a total of $311,975 in accounts payable. We expect to further reduce our accounts payable in 2010. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2010, we had a cash balance of $564,766. Over the last several years, we have been funding our operations through the sale of both equity and debt securities. In the first quarter of 2010 we sold $1,596,000 worth of convertible notes. In 2009 we sold $3,747,000 worth of convertible notes with $20,000 being converted to common stock in 2010. In 2008, we sold $4,457,000 in convertible notes. These notes are convertible at $1.00, and bear interest at 8% per year (See also Note 6 to our Financial Statements set forth herein). The 2008 notes come due in 2010. If our note holders choose not to convert the notes, we will either have to repay the notes, or reach an agreement with the note holders to extend the terms thereof. As we continue to sustain operating losses, we will need to raise additional funds for working capital. Recent Material Developments The Company incurred substantial non-cash expenses related to derivative liabilities stemming from the issuance of convertible notes and warrants, and employee stock options. The reason for these large non-cash expenses is that, as a Company lacking cash resources, we had to find ways to both fund our operations, as well as incentivize our employees. Sales and Manufacturing Our first quarter sales results for 2010 are up over 40.9% versus the first quarter of 2009, and are up over 300% the results of the first quarter of 2008: Q1 2010 Q1 2009 Q1 2008 Sales Revenue $180,251 $127,969 $ 66,444 Cost of Goods Sold $543,422 $350,617 $573,114 During the first quarter of 2010, the Company entered into two equipment leases for plant equipment. The equipment is to be delivered during the second quarter. The Company shall have the option to purchase the equipment at the end of each lease. The first lease is for a minimum of 6 months at $10,000 per month, with a purchase price of $108,000 (the rental payments would be applied to the purchase price). The second lease is for 18 months at $24,167 per month, with a $100,000 up front payment. The purchase price of the equipment is $535,006, and both the initial and rental payments would be applied to the purchase price. 10 Capitalization On April 27, 2009, the Company entered into an Investment Banking Agreement with Legend Securities, Inc. ("Legend"), pursuant to which Legend agreed to provide business advisory services to us for a period of up to twelve months. In exchange for Legend's services, we agreed to issue Legend a warrant to purchase 350,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share equal to $1.10 per share. On January 7, 2010 the parties agreed to mutually terminate that agreement, and to cancel the Company's obligation to issue the 350,000 warrants. In return, the Company has agreed to issue Legends 100,000 shares of Common Stock. Also on January 7, 2010, the parties entered into a new Investment Banking Agreement with Legend, pursuant to which Legend agreed to provide business advisory services for us for a period of up to twelve months. In exchange for Legend's services, we agreed to pay Legend the sum of $6,250 per month, as well as a one-time fee of 250,000 shares of Common Stock. Under the Investment Banking Agreement, we also agreed to give Legend unlimited "piggy back" registration rights with respect to the shares of our common stock in any registration statement filed by us in connection with an underwritten offering of our common stock. On January 15, 2010, we entered into a private placement subscription agreement with Brightline Ventures I, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company(the "purchaser" or "Brightline") pursuant to which we sold 130 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $1,300,000. The Company has agreed to extend Brightline's right to invest an additional $1,200,000 on substantially similar terms until February 28, 2010. Since October 15, 2009, we have sold an additional 1.7 units for an aggregate offering price of $17,000, of which $12,000 was in return for forgiveness of rent owed to our landlord. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all of our assets for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement"). The Notes are convertible into a total of 1,317,000 shares of Common Stock exclusive of interest. The interest is payable in additional shares of the Company's Common Stock, quarterly or upon maturity of the Notes. The Investors also received one five-year warrant for each Unit purchased, to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the purchasers were 1,975,500. The terms and conditions of the Units are substantially identical to the terms and conditions and constitute a part of the units previously sold by us in 2009 and reported on a Form 8-K filed by us on October 16, 2009 (the "2009 Units"). We also entered into registration rights agreements substantially similar to the registration rights agreement entered into with the purchasers of the 2008 Units pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants, with the exception that Brightline has agreed to suspend our obligation to do so until 45 days after we file our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, on or about October 14, 2009, the Company issued, pursuant to a consulting agreement, one five year warrant for the purchase of 10,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share. Between February 1 and March 31, 2010, we entered into a series of private placement subscription agreements with accredited investors (the "purchasers") pursuant to which we sold 39.9 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $399,000. Additionally, between April 1 and 3, 2010, we sold an additional 9.7 units. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all of our assets for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement"). The Notes are convertible into a total of 496,000 shares of Common Stock exclusive of interest. The interest is payable in additional shares of the Company's Common Stock, quarterly or upon maturity of the Notes. The Investors also received one five-year warrant for each Unit purchased, to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the purchasers were 598,500. The terms and conditions of the Units are substantially identical to the terms and conditions and constitute a part of the units previously sold by us in 2009 and reported on a Form 8-K filed by us on October 16, 2009 (the "2009 Units"). We also entered into registration rights agreements substantially similar to the registration rights agreement entered into with the purchasers of the 2008 Units pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants. The descriptions herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the forms of the Subscription Agreement, the Notes, the Warrant, the Security Agreements and the Registration Rights Agreement which are attached as exhibits to our Form 8-K filed on October 16, 2009. We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom.

As our current facility is a prototype plant, being the first of its kind to produce our innovative products, we are constantly seeking ways to improve efficiencies and achieve economies of scale. We are currently re-designing the process to make use of newer separation technologies and thereby optimize plant capacity. In order to fully realize the potential of our business model, the Company will eventually need to move to a larger facility, enter into strategic partnerships, or find some other means to produce greater volumes of finished product. 11 Results of Operations In 2009, our revenues decreased by 22.3% from 2008. The primary reason behind the decline in sales was our inability to produce enough product to meet demand. We are in the process of making material changes to our production process that we believe will be completed by the end of the second quarter in 2010. In making these changes, we have worked with industry specialists to improve our separation technology, as well as with scientists from the Aveka Group (see www.aveka.com for more information on the Aveka Group), to assist in finding ways to improve our capacity and reduce our costs. By applying new separation technology, in addition to the new dryer we previously purchased, we believe we will be able to increase our capacity and meet expected demand. In 2010, we expect demand to be approximately three times the amount of sales revenues achieved in 2009. The Company anticipates to be able to meet this demand, based on its plans to improve production. Additionally, in 2009, our cost of goods sold decreased by $750,472 or 30.9% from $2,429,620 in 2008 to $1,679,148 in 2009. In 2008 our cost of goods sold decreased by $655,708 or 21.2%, from $3,085,328 in 2007 to $2,429,620 in 2008. We continue to be more efficient in our production process, reducing cycle times and lowering utility costs. We believe that the trend of declining costs of goods sold will continue into 2010 and beyond. Significantly, cash flows used in operating activities decreased by $1,949,397 or 38.08%, to $3,169,633 for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $5,119,030 for the year ended December 31, 2008. Similarly, cash flows used in operating activities decreased by 22% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Since the beginning of 2008, management has made great efforts to reduce the amount of fees paid to outside professionals, and to focus all of its limited resources on items core to the Company’s business model. We believe the trend of decreasing operating cash losses will continue into 2010 and beyond. Additionally, we have reduced our accounts payable by $170,484 in 2009, on top of a reduction of $427,152 during 2008. On December 31, 2009, we had a total of $373,841 in accounts payable. We expect to further reduce our accounts payable in 2010. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2009, we had a cash balance of $324,784. Over the last several years, we have been funding our operations through the sale of both equity and debt securities. In 2008, we sold $4,457,000 in convertible notes. These notes are convertible at $1.00, and bear interest at 8% per year (See also Note 8 to our Financial Statements set forth herein). These notes come due in 2010. If our note holders choose not to convert the notes, we will either have to repay the notes, or reach an agreement with the note holders to extend the terms thereof. As we continue to sustain operating losses, we will need to raise additional funds for working capital. RECENT MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS Potential Liquidated Damages Relating to Registration Rights In connection with certain private placements of the Company’s securities (the “Registrable Securities”) effected in 2008 the Company entered into registration rights agreements (the “RRA”) that required the Company to file a registration statement covering the Registrable Securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than thirty days after the final closing as contemplated in the Private Placement Memorandum for the 2008 offering (the “Filing Deadline”). The Company filed a registration statement on December 14, 2009. However, the statement has not been declared effective as the Company is not S-3 eligible and will need to file an amended filing to convert the S-3 to an S-1. Management intends to file the S-1 after it files the 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. Under the terms of the registration rights agreement, as partial compensation, the Company was required to make pro rata payments to each Investor in an amount equal to 1.5% of the aggregate amount invested by such Investor for each 30-day period or pro rata for any portion thereof following the Filing Deadline for which no registration statement was filed. We obtained a release and waiver of the amounts due from 74 of the 2008 investors. As of April 5, 2010, there are 5 investors who have yet to sign the release and waiver. Under the terms of the RRA, as of that date we potentially owe, and therefore recognized as liquidated damages, the amount of $80,100. Reverse Stock Split As of the close business on February 6, 2009, the Company effectuated a one-for-thirty (1:30) reverse stock split. As part of this split, the Company’s stock began trading on February 9, 2009 under the symbol “ZTHO” on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Annual Shareholder’s Meeting and changes to Board of Directors On March 21, 2009, for personal reasons, Director Sheldon Drobny resigned as Director and Audit Chair of the Company. On March 25, 2009, the Company appointed Morris Garfinkle as Director and Audit Chair. On December 22, 2009, the Company held its Annual Shareholders’ meeting. The shareholders voted for a slate of five directors: Steven Cohen, Mark Hershhorn, Brian Israel, Morris Garfinkle and Edward Smith III. The following directors were not re-elected: Triveni Shukla. Key Hires Bring Wealth of Industry Experience Over the last 16 months, we have added key members to our management team: • Kyle Hanah – Director of Plant Operations • Mr. Hanah, a chemical engineer, has 20 years experience in the food industry.

She previously contributed to applications and quality assurance for Campbell's Soup Company and Conway Import Co., Inc., manufactures of Conway Salad Dressings and Sauces for foodservice. • Dr. Therese Malundo – VP Science and Technology • Dr. Malundo has a PhD in food science and an MBA with over 15 years experience, working for such companies as Pernod Ricard Americas and US Distilled Products, Co. She brings product development, process optimization, QA/QC and regulatory experience to our team. Applications Highlights Preliminary results from recent research and development efforts point to promising growth opportunities that address market trends and the needs of manufacturers and consumers alike. A key market trend is convenience, as hectic lifestyles force consumers to the grocery store freezer seeking high quality, quick meals and snacks. Z Trim® ingredients have shown to eliminate the hard edges during microwave cooking and reduce sogginess of frozen hand-held microwave snacks when used in the dough and meat fillings. Another major market driver, greater nutrition awareness, has prompted major food companies to proactively reduce the salt, fat, and sugar content of their standard product lines. Additionally, new legislation requires food manufacturers and foodservice establishments to clearly communicate nutritional profiles, including fat and calorie content. Recent studies where Z Trim® was added to the batter and breading used to coat fried chicken resulted in reduced oil absorption of 15% or more. This product application represents an enormous growth opportunity with fast-food companies as well as with manufacturers of frozen convenience meals. 12 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE On December 22, 2009, our shareholders approved the re-appointment of M&K CPAs, LLC as our public accountant. There are no disagreements with our accountant on accounting and financial disclosure. BUSINESS Z Trim Holdings, Inc. deploys technology, formulation, and product performance solutions built around cutting-edge dietary fibers for both domestic and international food markets. Z Trim ® multifunctional fiber ingredients originated from a USDA patent for minimally processed, non-caloric functional food ingredients made from healthy dietary fiber. With an exclusive license from the USDA, this patent is central to the company’s intellectual property portfolio. Z Trim Holdings subsequently evolved the processing technology and expanded the fiber sources to create innovative ingredients with unique properties that provide multifunctional benefits that help create value for food manufacturers around the world. Currently, Z Trim is made from corn and oat, but it can be produced from virtually any cellulose, the substance that makes up most of a plant’s cell walls, and is one of the most abundant organic compounds on earth. The Company’s core product portfolio of multifunctional dietary fiber food ingredients includes corn Z Trim® and non-GMO oat Z Trim®. The superior water-holding capacity and amorphous structure of Z Trim ingredients are key to the exclusive multifunctional attributes they contribute to food product design, including moisture management, oil deflection, texture and appearance quality, fat and calorie reduction, and cost control. Z Trim® is now being used by food manufacturers, restaurants, schools, and consumers on 6 continents, across a multitude of food categories, such as meats, sauces, soups, dressings, baked goods, fillings, toppings, prepared meals, dairy products, frozen handheld snacks, and pizza dough. Food formulators are seeking greater functionality and product performance than they can get from starches, gums, fats, and other fibers – for both standard and lower fat content foods - and are increasingly discovering how Z Trim® multifunctional fiber ingredients can help to delight their consumers with finished products that have enhanced eating quality, outstanding product performance, and frequently, improved nutritional profiles. Major market drivers such as greater nutrition awareness, increasing obesity trends, the economy, rising costs and hectic lifestyles have triggered an evolution of the food industry and consumer expectations. The Company’s goal is to further enable food manufacturers to address the challenges and opportunities of this evolution by helping them to differentiate their products, achieve their growth objectives, and delight their consumers. Z Trim® multifunctional fiber ingredients create value for both food manufacturers and consumers in three primary areas: product formulation, processing improvements, and finished product performance. Through ongoing product applications research, the Company develops solutions that help food manufacturers solve formulation and product challenges and capture market opportunities with high quality, innovative products that fulfill consumer expectations. The Company currently manufactures and markets Z Trim® products as cost-competitive ingredients that help improve the food industry’s ability to deliver on its promises of quality, taste, and healthfulness. The Company’s primary goal is establishing Z Trim as an important ingredient in the evolution of the food industry and consumer expectations. The Company is developing its market through (i) direct and brokered sales to major food manufacturers, as well as small and mid size companies for packaged retail foods, and (ii) direct and brokered sales to large and small foodservice manufacturers that supply to restaurants, hospitals, schools and cafeterias. Our R&D team, in conjunction with our customers and strategic industry partners, continues to work on the development of additional products and applications. In addition to direct sales, we use a network of ingredient distributors, both domestic and international, to distribute our products. Raw materials are sourced principally in the United States. Approximately 70% of our raw materials consist of corn bran and oat hulls and are generally available from a variety of suppliers. Our major suppliers include Bunge and Didion Milling, Inc. We seek to mitigate the risk of a shortage of raw materials through identification of alternative suppliers for the same or similar raw materials, where available. We have purchasing staff with extensive knowledge of our products who work with marketing, product research and development and quality control personnel to source raw materials for products and other items. The Company’s customers are food manufacturers, school districts and the general public. There were three significant customers who accounted for 20%, 20% and 14% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2009. There were two significant customers who accounted for 37% and 13% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Z Trim Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Illinois on May 5, 1994 under the original name Circle Group Entertainment Ltd. The Company has no operating subsidiaries. Z Trim Holdings operates within global business of food additives, which, as of 2006 was a $25 billion industry. The global hydrocolloid business - which consists of agents used for thickening, gelling and stabilizing food and beverage products is over $19 billion per year ( http://www.sriconsulting.com/CEH/Public/Reports/582.7000/ ) with food applications constituting approximately $4.2 billion of that total (http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Financial-Industry/Health-and-prices-dominate-hydrocolloids-debate). Specifically, the U.S. fat replacer and bulk dietary fiber (supplement) markets are estimated to be just over $500 million each, with carbohydrate-based fat replacers such as Z Trim accounting for approximately 59 percent of the market in 2000 ( http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-top.pag?docid=10039518 ). Food systems are complex, and in order to meet consumers’ taste and quality expectations, various ingredients must be used to achieve the structural, organoleptic, performance and shelf-life properties specific to a given food product. Z Trim® ingredients compete with a wide variety of hydrocolloids and other fiber ingredients. Depending on the food application, required functional properties and product development objectives, competitive ingredients might include gums (e.g. guar, xanthan, locust bean, and Arabic), seaweed extracts (e.g. alginates, carrageenan), starches (native, modified and resistant), and fibers (e.g. oat bran, corn bran, pea fiber, potato fiber). Most of these competitive ingredients are well-established in the food industry, and many of the companies that supply them have substantially greater resources than our Company. However, we believe that the unique properties of Z Trim multifunctional fiber ingredients pose not only significant market opportunities for our Company, but also provide tremendous differentiation and growth opportunities for food companies. No other single hydrocolloid or fiber has the combined water holding and binding capacity that’s effective across as wide a pH and temperature range as Z Trim®, nor imparts as many superior attributes to the finished consumer food product. Furthermore, Z Trim® ingredients can have synergistic effects with other hydrocolloids and fibers, allowing food manufacturers to achieve even greater processing improvements, cost efficiencies, and finished product performance. The Company protects intangible assets that includes patents pending and issued, as well as trade secrets and know how. Central to this portfolio is an exclusive license to US Patent No. 5,766,662, including all related international patents, issued to Dr. George Inglett of the USDA. This license expires upon the expiration of the underlying patent in 2015. Additionally, the USDA patent was filed in several countries throughout the world. Through the process of development and commercialization of the technology, the Company has identified and sought patent protection for improvements to the manufacturing process, product applications and is currently developing several spin-off technologies. On December 1, 2009, we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7,625,591 B2; such will expire in 2026 with payment of maintenance fees. We require all employees and visitors to our plant to execute a non-disclosure agreement. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies. We intend to continue to file patent applications covering any newly developed products and technologies. However, there can be no guarantee that any of our pending or future filed applications will issue as patents. Presently, the Company employs 25 full-time employees and one part-time employees.

The Code is intended to focus the Board and the individual Directors on areas of ethical risk, help Directors recognize and deal with ethical issues, provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct, and foster a culture of honesty and accountability. The Code covers all areas of professional conduct relating to service on the Z Trim Board, including conflicts of interest, unfair or unethical use of corporate opportunities, strict protection of confidential information, compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and oversight of ethics and compliance by employees of the Company. The full text of both Z Trim’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is published on our website at http://www.ztrim.com/pages/code_of_ethics___business_conduct/40.php . We will disclose any future amendments to, or waivers from, provisions of these ethical policies and standards for Officers and Directors on our website within two business days following the date of such amendment or waiver. Committees of the Board of Directors Our business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board of Directors. Members of our Board are kept informed of our business through discussions with our Chief Executive Officer and other officers, by reviewing materials provided to them, by visiting our offices and plants and by participating in meetings of the Board and its Committees. All Board members are expected to attend our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, unless an emergency prevents them from doing so. At our 2008 and 2009 Annual Meetings, all of our directors standing for election attended. Our Board of Directors currently has three Committees. Those Committees consisted of an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating Committee. Nominating Committee The Board Nominating Committee, composed of two independent directors of the Company, identifies candidates for director nominees through recommendations solicited from other directors, the Company’s executive officers, search firms or other advisors, shareholders pursuant to the procedures set forth below, and through such other methods as the independent directors deem to be helpful. Brian Israel and Mark Hershhorn were appointed as members of the Nominating Committee, with Brian Israel serving as chairman. In determining whether to nominate each of the current directors for another term (or new directors for a first term), the Board’s Nominating Committee, composed of two independent directors, considered a candidate’s knowledge of the Company’s business and industry, prior education, demonstrated ability to exercise sound business judgment, reputation for integrity and high moral and ethical character, potential to contribute to the diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds, or experiences of the Board as a whole and diligence and dedication to the success of the Company. The Nominating Committee concluded that each of the current directors standing for re-election possesses unique talents, backgrounds, perspectives, attributes and skills that will enable each of them to continue to provide valuable insights to Company management and play an important role in helping the Company achieve its long-term goals and objectives. The composition of the board must meet the independence requirements promulgated by the American Stock Exchange. The Company requires its directors to possess certain minimum qualifications, including adequate experience, the absence of any conflicts of interest and the absence of any prior bad acts. Among the further considerations of the Company in its selection of director are a candidate’s knowledge of the Company’s business and industry, prior education, demonstrated ability to exercise sound business judgment, reputation for integrity and high moral and ethical character, potential to contribute to the diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds, or experiences of the board as a whole and diligence and dedication to the success of the Company. Additional specific director qualification criteria are set forth in the Company's bylaws . Audit Committee The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed of one director, Morris Garfinkle, who is considered an “independent director” under the rules of the American Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board of Directors has determined that Morris Garfinkle qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” under SEC rules. The function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in preserving the integrity of the financial information published by the Company through the review of financial and accounting controls and policies, financial reporting systems, alternative accounting principles that could be applied and the quality and effectiveness of the independent public accountants. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, administers the Company’s executive compensation program. The role of the Committee is to oversee Z Trim’s compensation and benefit plans and policies, administer its stock plans (including reviewing and approving equity grants to elected officers) and review and approve annually all compensation decisions for elected officers including those for the Chairman and CEO and the other executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (the “Named Executive Officers”). The Committee submits its compensation decisions for the CEO to the Board for ratification. Z Trim’s Compensation Committee Charter is available online at http://www.ztrim.com/pages/compensation_committee_charter/41.php. Brian Israel was appointed to serve as chairman of the Compensation Committee in April of 2007. On December 19, 2007, Michael Donahue was appointed to serve as a member of the Compensation Committee. On September 19, 2008, Mark Hershhorn was appointed to replace Michael Donahue as a member of the Compensation Committee. Brian Israel and Mark Hershhorn each qualifies as an “independent director” under the rules of the American Stock Exchange. The Compensation Committee, pursuant to its Charter, is responsible for the following: 1. Review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), evaluate the CEO’s performance in light to those goals and objectives, and either as a committee or together with the other independent directors (as directed by the Board), determine, or recommend to the Board for determination, the CEO’s compensation level based on this evaluation. In determining or recommending the long-term incentive component of CEO compensation, the Committee shall consider, among other factors, the Company’s performance and relative shareholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to CEO’s at comparable companies, the awards given to the CEO in past years, and such other factors as the Committee shall so determine. 2. Either as a committee or together with the other independent directors (as directed by the Board), determine, or recommend to the Board for determination, the compensation of all other officers of the Company. 3. Make recommendations to the Board with respect to the Company’s incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans, oversee the activities of the individuals and committees responsible for administering these plans, and discharge any responsibilities imposed on the Committee by any of these plans. 4. In consultation with management, oversee regulatory compliance with respect to compensation matters, including overseeing the Company’s policies on structuring compensation programs to preserve tax deductibility, and, as and when required, establishing performance goals and certifying that performance goals have been attained for purposes of Section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 5. To review and approve any severance or similar termination payments proposed to be made to any current or former officer of the Company. 6. Prepare an annual Report of the Compensation Committee on Executive Compensation for inclusion in the Company’s annual proxy statement in accordance with applicable SEC rules and regulations. 7. Periodically review and assess the adequacy of this charter and recommend any proposed changes to the Board for approval, including changes concerning the structure and operations of the Committee. 8. Perform any other duties or responsibilities expressly delegated to the Committee by the Board from time to time relating to the Company’s compensation programs. 15 Compensation Committee Report The Z Trim Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed with Z Trim management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and, based on that discussion, recommended it to the Z Trim’s Board of Directors for inclusion in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and which is included in this prospectus. The Committee, with the assistance of Z Trim’s Human Resource functions, completed an assessment of the risks associated with Z Trim’s compensation policies and practices. At the end of the risk assessment process, the Committee concluded that (1) the Senior Executive Officer (SEO) compensation programs do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking; (2) other employee compensation plans do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking, threaten the value of the Company, or reward short-term results to the detriment of long-term value creation; and (3) Z Trim’s compensation programs do not encourage the manipulation of reported earnings. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Brian Israel (Committee Chairman) Mark Hershhorn Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The Compensation Committee is composed entirely of persons who are neither Associates nor former or current officers of the Company. There is not, nor was there during fiscal 2009, any compensation committee interlock or insider participation on the Compensation Committee .

These shares, at the request of Legend Securities, Inc., have been broken up into three parts, to be issued as follows: 17,500 to Legends Securities, Inc., 83,125 to John Columbia and 249,375 to Thomas Wagner. In January 26, 2009 the Company agreed issue to certain note holders who had purchased on various dates in 2008, certain notes and warrants of the Company, as described below, new warrants to purchase, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, that number of shares of our Common Stock, to which a Note Holder would be entitled upon full conversion of a note after a reverse split of the Common Stock with a ratio of one for thirty. We refer to these warrants as the New Warrants. Effective February 6, 2009 the Company effected a 1 for 30 stock split. We refer to this split as the “Reverse Split.” After the effective date of the Reverse Split, for each $100,000 in principal amount of the Notes purchased in 2008, note holders received a New Warrant exercisable for 20,833 shares of our common stock and 936,860 shares in the aggregate for all such New Warrants at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The description of the terms of sale of the securities described above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underlying documents filed as an exhibit to this registration statement. We seek to register 762,488 shares of common stock underlying the New Warrants. This prospectus includes (i) 65,133 shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of warrants with an exercise price of $.01 and $.30 per share (ii) 332,607 shares underlying warrants with an exercise price of $.30 per share and (iii) 1,806,205 shares underlying warrants with an exercise price of $1.00. On June 18, September 2, and November 12, 2008, we sold an aggregate of 44.57 units. Each of the units consists of a $100,000 24-month 8% senior secured promissory note convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into shares of our common stock plus additional shares upon the conversion of accrued interest at maturity into our common stock. Interest, at the rate of 8% per annum, is accrued in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. We refer to the units as the 2008 Units and to the notes as the 2008 Notes. The 2008 Notes are convertible into a total of 4,456,997 shares of our Common Stock plus 713,117 shares for accrued interest at maturity. We are not registering the shares of Common stock underlying the 2008 Notes. Investors of each Unit also received two five-year warrants, one to purchase 7,692 shares of our Common Stock per unit and 409,509 in the aggregate for all such warrants (including placement agent’s warrants), with an exercise price of $0.30 per share (the “$0.30 Warrants”), and the other to purchase 5,128 shares of Common Stock per unit and 1,652,770 (including placement agent’s warrants) in the aggregate for all such warrants, with an exercise price of $1.00 per share. We refer to these warrants as the “$1.00 Warrants” and the “$0.30 Warrants”. We refer to them collectively as the “2008 Warrants”. We are registering the shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of (65,133), as well as the shares issuable (332,607, including the placement agent’s warrants) under the outstanding $.30 Warrants for a total of 397,740 shares of our common stock. We are not registering 228,595 shares issued upon a cashless exercise of the $.01 and $.30 Warrants. In addition to a cash commission, the placement agent received for each 2008 Unit sold two five-year warrants, one to purchase 66,667 shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price of $.30 per share and the other to purchase 555,670 shares with an exercise price of $1.00. Such warrants are included in the total of the share of common stock set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph. We also entered into registration rights agreements in connection with the private placement pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants, unless the underlying common stock can be sold without any limitations or conditions under Rule 144. The placement agent’s warrants carry registration rights that are the same as those afforded to investors in the private placement. The description of the terms of sale of the securities described above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underlying documents filed as exhibits to our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on June 24 and September 2, 2008. This prospectus includes 151,635 shares of our common stock underlying warrants issued in 2007 at an exercise price of $13.69 per share. The numbers have been adjusted to reflect application of anti-dilution provisions and the one for 30 reverse split that took effect in February of 2009. We refer to these warrants as the “2007 Warrants.” On March 29, 2007, we sold unregistered shares of our common stock and warrants exercisable for our Common Stock. We sold 80 units in the private placement at a price of $100,000 per unit, with each unit consisting of 3,333 shares of Common Stock and a five-year warrant with an exercise price of $13.69 per share (as adjusted) to purchase approximately 2,159 shares (as adjusted) of Common Stock for an aggregate of 175,303 shares of our common stock. We also entered into a registration rights agreement in connection with the private placement pursuant to which we agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission this registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock and Common Stock underlying the Warrants. J.P. Turner & Company, LLC served as the lead placement agent in connection with the private placement. This prospectus includes 40,000 shares of our common stock underlying warrants issued in 2007 to the placement agent for the offering described above. J.P. Turner, together with any affiliate placement agents, received warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of Common Stock on terms which are identical to the 2007 Warrants except that the exercise price is $1.00 per share. In addition, the placement agent’s warrant has registration rights that are the same as those afforded to investors in the private placement. The description of the terms of sale of the securities described above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underlying documents filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10KSB filed on April 2, 2007 and which exhibits are incorporated herein by reference. 19 The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of May 10, 2010 by each of the Selling Shareholders and the maximum number of shares that may be sold hereunder. The term “Selling Stockholder” includes the Shareholders listed below and their respective transferees, assignees, pledges, donees and other successors. The number of shares that may be actually sold by any Selling Stockholder will be determined by the Selling Stockholder. Because the Selling Shareholders may sell all, some or none of the shares of common stock which they hold, and because the offering contemplated by this prospectus is not currently being underwritten, no estimate can be given as to the number of or percentage of total shares of Common Stock that will be held by the Selling Shareholders upon termination of the offering. Except as noted below, no Selling Stockholder is a broker-dealer or an affiliate of a broker-dealer. As of May 10, 2010 there were 3,603,217 shares of Common Stock outstanding. The following table reflects the 30 for 1 reverse stock split affected on February 6, 2009.

These dispositions may be at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market price, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. The Selling Shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when disposing of shares or interests therein:  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  privately negotiated transactions;  short sales effected after the date the registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part is declared effective by the SEC;  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; and a combination of any such methods of sale. The Selling Shareholders may, from time to time, pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of Common Stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of Common Stock, from time to time, under this Prospectus, or under an amendment to this Prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the 1933 Act amending the list of Selling Shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors-in- as Selling Shareholders under this Prospectus. The Selling Shareholders also may transfer the shares of Common Stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors-in-interest will be the selling, beneficial owners for purposes of this Prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Shareholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. The Selling Shareholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. In connection with the sale of our Common Stock or interests therein, the Selling Shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the Common Stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Shareholders may also sell shares of our Common Stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the Common Stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this Prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this Prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). The Selling Shareholders will receive the aggregate proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock offered by them. The aggregate proceeds to the Selling Shareholders from the sale of the Common Stock offered by them will be the purchase price of the Common Stock less discounts or commissions, if any. Each of the Selling Shareholders reserves the right to accept and, together with their agents from time to time, to reject, in whole or in part, any proposed purchase of Common Stock to be made directly or through agents. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of Common Stock in this offering. We may receive proceeds from holders who exercise their warrants and pay the applicable cash exercise price in connection with those exercises. The Selling Shareholders also may resell all or a portion of the shares in open market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 under the 1933 Act rather than under this Prospectus, provided that they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of that rule. The Selling Shareholders and any underwriters, broker-dealers or agents that participate in the sale of the Common Stock or interests therein may be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the 1933 Act. Any discounts, commissions, concessions or profit they earn on any resale of the shares may be underwriting discounts and commissions under the 1933 Act. Selling Shareholders who are “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the 1933 Act will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the 1933 Act. To the extent required the shares of our Common Stock to be sold, the names of the Selling Shareholders, the respective purchase prices and public offering prices, the names of any agent, dealer or underwriter, any applicable commissions or discounts with respect to a particular offer will be set forth in an accompanying prospectus supplement or, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement that includes this Prospectus. In order to comply with the securities laws of some states, if applicable, the Common Stock may be sold in these jurisdictions only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the Common Stock may not be sold unless it has been registered or qualified for sale or an exemption from registration or qualification requirements is available and is complied with. We have advised the Selling Shareholders that the anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the 1934 Act may apply to sales of shares in the market and to the activities of the Selling Shareholders and their affiliates. In addition, we will make copies of this Prospectus (as it may be supplemented or amended from time to time) available to the Selling Shareholders for the purpose of satisfying the prospectus delivery requirements of the 1933 Act. The Selling Shareholders may indemnify any broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving the sale of the shares of Common Stock against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the 1933 Act. We will pay all of the expenses incident to registration other than commissions, fees and discounts of underwriters, brokers, dealers and agents. We will pay for offering expenses including the SEC registration fee, accounting fees, legal fees, printing expenses and other related have agreed to indemnify the Selling Shareholders against liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act and state securities laws, relating to the registration of the shares offered by this Prospectus. We have agreed with the Selling Shareholders to keep the registration statement of which this Prospectus constitutes a part effective until the earlier of (1) such time as all of the shares covered by this Prospectus have been disposed of pursuant to and in accordance with the registration statement or (2) the date on which the shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restrictions of the 1933 Act. 26 MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low closing prices for our common stock, as quoted for trading on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol “ZTM” and on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol “ZTMH” and “ZTHO.” Our common stock began trading on the American Stock Exchange on March 31, 2004. On September 16, 2008, our Company moved from the American Stock Exchange and began trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. As of the close of business on February 6, 2009, the Company effectuated a one-for-thirty (1:30) reverse stock split. All prices in the following table reflect post-reverse split prices. Common Stock Quarter Ended High Low 2008 March 31, 2008 $14.40 $6.30 June 30, 2008 $10.80 $3.60 September 30, 2008 $6.90 $0.90 December 31, 2008 $4.50 $0.60 2009 March 31, 2009 $1.50 $0.25 June 30, 2009 $2.20 $0.99 September 30, 2009 $1.11 $0.79 December 31, 2009 $2.00 $0.62 2010 March 31, 2010 $1.95 $0.99 May 10, 2010 $1.20 $0.90 As of May 10, 2010, there were approximately 5,424 record holders of the common stock. This number does not include shareholders whose shares are held in securities position listings. We have never paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our 8% Convertible Notes issued in 2008, 2009 and 2010 restrict our ability to pay dividends without the consent of the Noteholders.

Plans not approved by shareholders: None 27 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK Our authorized capitalization consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, $.00005 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 5,000,000 have been designated Series A and 1,000,000 have been designated Series I. As May 1, 2010 none of the preferred have been issued. COMMON STOCK We have 3,603,217 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of May 10, 2010. In addition we have warrants to purchase 11,755,218 shares of our common stock at prices ranging from $30.00 to $0.01 per share. Voting Rights. The holder of a share of common stock is entitled to one vote for all purposes. Cumulative voting is permitted in the election of directors. Accordingly, every shareholder has the right to vote the number of shares owned by him for as many persons as there are directors to be elected, or to cumulate their shares, and give one candidate as many votes as the number of directors multiplied by the number of his/her shares, or to distribute them on the same principle among as many candidates as the shareholder desires. On all matters, other than the election of directors a vote of majority of the votes cast, except where the Illinois Business Corporation Act prescribes a greater percentage of votes and/or exercise of voting power, such as an amendment of our Articles of Incorporation.. Dividend Rights. Subject to preferential rights with respect to future outstanding Preferred Stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. We have never paid any dividends on our common stock. The declaration in the future of any cash or stock dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon the earnings, capital requirements, and financial position of the Company, general economic conditions, and other pertinent factors. In addition the 8% Convertible Notes of the Company issued in 2008 and 2009 restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends. The Series A and the Series I Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company also restricts the Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock. There is no assurance that any dividends will be paid in the future as we have no present plans to pay dividends. Liquidation Rights. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and satisfaction of preferential rights and have no rights to convert their Common Stock into any other securities. Preemptive Rights, Conversion Rights, Redemption Provisions, Sinking Fund Provision and Liability to Further Calls and Assessments. There are no preemptive or conversion rights, redemption provisions, or sinking fund provisions relating to the common stock. All currently outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The rights of holders of the existing class of common stock may in the future become subject to prior and superior rights and preferences of the Series A and Series I as well as any other series that the board of directors may establish. PREFERRED STOCK. The Company has authority to issue 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, there are no shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock outstanding. The Company’s board of directors may issue the authorized Preferred Stock in one or more series and may fix the number of shares of each series of Preferred Stock. The board of directors also has the authority to set the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, including the dividend rights, dividend rate, terms of redemption, redemption price or prices, conversion and voting rights and liquidation preferences. Preferred Stock can be issued and its terms set by the board of directors without any further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders. The Board of Directors has authorized a Series A preferred stock which it currently has no intention to issue. It has also authorized a Series I 8% Convertible Preferred Stock for a maximum of 1,000,000 shares of the Series I. Payment of the dividend, mandatory redemption and any provisions requiring payment on the Preferred Stock are deferred (the “Deferral”) until the 2008 Notes (as defined below) due in 2010 and the 2009 Notes due in 2011 and 2012 (collectively the “Notes”) are paid in full. Such Deferral, even if the maturity dates on the Notes are extended, will not constitute a default under the Preferred Stock terms. Dividend Provisions . Subject to the Deferral, the holders of shares of Series I Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends, out of any assets legally available therefor, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend (payable other than in shares of common stock of the Company, or other securities and rights convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive, directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock) on the shares of Common Stock, at the rate of 8% of $5.00 per share (the “ Original Series I Issue Price ”) per annum, payable in shares of the Common Stock, at the option of the Holder, either quarterly or on the Redemption Date (as hereinafter defined). The Original Series I Issue Price of the Series I Preferred Stock is $5.00 per share. The initial Conversion Price is $1.00. Dividends accrue on each share from the date of issuance of the Series I Preferred Stock(the “ Issuance Date ”), and accrue from day to day, whether or not earned or declared. Dividends are cumulative. Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, subject to the rights of a series of preferred stock that may from time to time come into existence, the holders of Series I Preferred Stock are entitled to receive ratably, prior to and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of Common Stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) the Original Series I Issue Price, ($5.00) for each outstanding share of Series I Preferred Stock and (ii) accrued but unpaid dividends on such share. A liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, (A) the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation but, excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company); or (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; unless the Company’s shareholders of record as constituted immediately prior to such acquisition or sale will, immediately after such acquisition or sale (by virtue of securities issued as consideration for the Company’s acquisition or sale or otherwise) hold at least 50% of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity (each of such events, a “ Deemed Liquidation Event ”). In any of such events, if the consideration received by the Company is other than cash, its value will be deemed its fair market value. Redemption. Subject to the rights of preferred stock which may from time to time come into existence and the Deferral referred to above, the Company shall redeem, pro rata, from any source of funds legally available therefor, the Series I Preferred Stock 24 months after the Issuance Date of each share of such Series I Preferred Stock (the “ Series I Redemption Date ”). The redemption by the Company must be paid in cash in exchange for the shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed in an amount equal to the sum of $5.00 per share of Series I Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares) plus all accrued or accumulated but unpaid dividends, on such shares payable in the shares of the Common Stock (the “ Series I Redemption Price ”). Conversion. Each share of Series I Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the Holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share and on or prior to the fifth day prior to the Redemption Date, if any, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for such stock, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (x) the Original Series I Issue Price plus the amount represented by accrued but unpaid dividends on such share by (y) the Conversion Price (as defined below) applicable to such share, determined as hereafter provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. Conversion Price/Adjustment. The initial Conversion Price per share for shares of Series I Preferred Stock is $1.00 , subject to adjustment, stock splits and combinations, certain dividends and distributions; reclassification, exchange or substitution, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sales of assets. In addition, in the event that the Company sells or issues Common Stock after the Issuance Date at a price less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such sale or issuance, then the Conversion Price shall be reduced immediately thereafter so that it shall equal the price at which such Conversion Shares are sold or issued, as applicable. Subject to the readjustment provisions hereinafter set forth, in case the Company shall at any time after the Issuance Date issue options, rights or warrants to subscribe for Common Stock, or issue any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (collectively the “Rights”), for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Rights, or without consideration, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Rights, shall be reduced to the price established for such Rights that entitle the holders thereof to receive Common Stock . Readjustment Provisions . If (i)any change shall occur in the price per share provided for in any of the Rights: (ii) any change shall occur in the price per share at which the securities referred to in this subsection are exchangeable; (iii) any of the Rights are exercised in an amount or at a price different from the assumed aggregate maximum number of shares or the minimum purchase price provided in this subsection; or (iv) any of the Rights are cancelled or expire without being exercised, then (x) such Rights, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been cancelled, expired or terminated on the date when such price change, exercise or expiration became effective in respect to shares not theretofore issued pursuant to the exercise or exchange thereof, (y) the Company shall be deemed to have issued upon such date new Rights at the new price in respect of the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such Rights, and (z) the adjustment to Conversion Price provided in this subsection shall be recalculated as if the original issuance causing the prior adjustment to Conversion Price had not occurred. Consequently, if the Rights are subsequently modified, cancelled or expire without exercise, any adjustment previously made to the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to reflect such modification, cancellation and or expiration. Any reset of the Conversion Price shall not reduce the Conversion Price below $0.10. 28 No Adjustment of Conversion Price in Certain Cases. No adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made: (A) Upon issuance or sale of the Series I Preferred Stock, or the warrants and warrant shares issued in connection with the issuance of the Series I Preferred Stock, or shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of other options, warrants and convertible securities outstanding as of the Issuance Date of the Series I Preferred Stock. (B) Upon the issuance or sale of any shares of capital stock, or the grant of options exercisable therefor, outstanding as of, or granted, exercised, issued or issuable on or after the first issuance of the Series I Preferred Stock, to directors, officers, employees, advisers and consultants of the Corporation or any subsidiary pursuant to any incentive or non-qualified stock option plan or agreement, stock purchase plan or agreement, stock restriction agreement or restricted stock plan, employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), consulting agreement, stock appreciation right (SAR), stock depreciation right (SDR), bonus stock arrangement, or such other similar compensatory options, issuances, arrangements, agreements or plans approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. (C) Upon the issuance of any shares of capital stock or the grant of warrants or options (or the exercise thereof) as consideration for mergers (other than as referred to in Subsection D. 4. (a) (iv) above), acquisitions, strategic alliances and other commercial transactions, other than in connection with a financing transaction. (D) If the amount of said adjustment shall be less than one cent ($0.01) per security issuable upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock; provided, however, that in such case any adjustment that would otherwise be required then to be made shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment so carried forward, shall amount to at least one cent ($0.01) per security issuable upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to any Holder any certificate or certificates by the fifth Trading Day after the Conversion Date, the Company shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of the amount of the Redemption Price for the shares of the Series I Preferred Stock being converted, $5 per Trading Day (increasing to $10 per Trading Day after five Trading Days after such damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after such fifth Trading Day until such certificates are delivered. Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder any certificate or certificates required by the fifth Trading Day after the Conversion Date, and if after such fifth Trading Day the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such conversion (a “ Buy-In ”), then the Company shall (i) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition to any remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount by which (x) the Holder’s total Original Series I Issue Price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder anticipated receiving from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price of the Common Stock at the time of the sale (including brokerage commissions, if any) giving rise to such purchase obligation and (ii) at the option of the Holder, either reissue Series I Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the Original Series I Issue Price of the attempted conversion or deliver to the Holder the number of shares Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its delivery requirements. Fractional Shares . No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which a Holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay in cash any remainder resulting from after the number of whole Common Stock is determined as a result of any conversion. If the Company elects not, or is unable, to make such a cash payment, the Holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the final fraction of a Common Share, one whole Common Share. Voting Rights. The Holder of each share of Series I Preferred Stock shall not have the have the right to vote except as expressly set forth under the section entitled “Waiver” below and as may be required under the Illinois Business Company Act. Waiver. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of the Series I Preferred Stock may be amended or waived on behalf of all holders of the Series I Preferred Stock by the affirmative written consent or vote of the holders of at least a simple majority of the Series I Preferred Stock then outstanding. Protective Provisions . The terms of the Series I Preferred Stock also contain provisions, subject to the rights of the holders of other series of preferred stock, which prohibit the Company from taking certain actions as long as at least 1,200,000 shares of the Series I Preferred stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) or 30% of the total number of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock issued, whichever is less, are outstanding, without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series I Preferred Stock. 29 8% CONVERTIBLE SECURED NOTES ISSUED IN 2008 The 8% Convertible Notes (the “2008 Notes”) are convertible at any time until maturity, at the election of the 2008 Note holder, into shares of Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share (or 100,000 shares per each Unit investment of $100,000). The 2008 Notes mature in 2010. The conversion price is subject to adjustment on the basis of a full ratchet anti-dilution provision. At maturity, the 2008 Note holders will have the option to convert their 2008 Note in full to Common Stock or will be entitled to be repaid the principal amount of the 2008 Note in cash. The 2008 Notes bear interest, payable in Common Stock at the rate of 8% per annum, payable in shares of Common Stock at the election of the Holder quarterly in arrears or upon maturity. The number of Common Shares to be issued to the Holder is equal to the result obtained by dividing (x) the amount of interest accrued by (y) the Conversion Price. The 2008 Notes are secured by a first lien on all assets of the Company for so long as the 2008 Notes remain outstanding. The 2008 Notes restrict that Company’s ability to take certain actions including paying dividends or redeeming its capital stock. The 2008 Notes rank pari passu, with the 2009 Notes described below. At maturity, interest on the 2008 Notes would be convertible into an additional 713,120 shares. The 2008 Notes do not confer any voting rights or any other rights as a Company stockholder The Company entered into registration rights agreements with the holder of the 2008 Notes covering the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2008 Notes and exercise of the 2008 warrants that were issued in connection with the purchase of the 2008 Notes. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to a copy of the form of the 2008 Notes and related documentation filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K on June 24, 2008. 8% CONVERTIBLE SECURED NOTES ISSUED IN 2009 The 8% Convertible Notes (the “2009 Notes”) are convertible at any time until maturity, at the election of the Note holder, into shares of Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share (or 10,000 shares per each Unit investment of $10,000). The 2009 Notes mature in 2011 and 2012. At maturity, the 2009 Note holders will have the option to convert their 2009 Note in full to Common Stock or will be entitled to be repaid the principal amount of the Note in cash. The 2009 Notes bear interest, payable in Common Stock at the rate of 8% per annum, payable in common stock, at the option of the holder either quarterly or upon maturity. The 2009 Notes are secured by a first lien on all assets of the Company for so long as the Notes remain outstanding. The Notes restrict the Company’s ability to take certain actions including, paying dividends or redeeming its capital stock. The 2009 Notes rank pari passu with the 2008 Notes. The 2009 Notes do not confer any voting rights or any other rights as a Company stockholder. The 2009 Notes, warrants and the other documents comprising the 2009 offering were amended to conform to the terms and conditions of the 2008 Notes and related documents and agreements, including a registration rights agreement and full ratchet anti dilution conversion and exercise price adjustment provisions applicable to the 2009 Note and the warrant; as well as the payment of interest on the Notes in Common Stock, at the option of the holder, quarterly or at maturity rather than just at maturity. The 2009 Notes may be amended or modified and the observance of any term may be waived, with the consent of the holders of 2009 Notes representing a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal. At maturity, interest on the 2009 Notes will be convertible into an additional 884,442 shares. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to a copy of the form of the 2009 Notes, as amended, and the related documentation, filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC on October 16, 2009. WARRANTS AND VARIABLE PRICE 11,755,218 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding, including warrants for 83,333 shares at a variable price equal to the lowest twelve-trading-day average closing price of our Common Stock at any point between February 13, 2008 and February 8, 2011, as elected by the holder (the “Variable Warrants”), expiring February 8, 2011. Any exercise of the Variable Warrants could be at a substantial discount to the then-current market price, which could result in charges to earnings and substantial dilution to existing shareholders. 2008 Warrants The following is a summary of certain provisions of the two types of warrants issued by the Company in connection with a private placement effected at various dates in 2008 (the “2008 Warrants”). This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in all respects by reference to the actual text of the Warrants, the forms of which were filed as exhibits to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 24, 2008. Each 2008 Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase shares of Common Stock, at any time until five years from the date of issuance , at a per share price of $0.30 for the $0.30 Warrants and $4.80 per share for the $4.80 Warrants, subject to certain adjustments. No fractional shares will be issued upon the exercise of the 2008 Warrants. The exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including stock dividends, stock splits, combinations or reclassifications of the Common Stock. Additionally, an adjustment would be made in the case of a reclassification or exchange of Common Stock, consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation) or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in order to enable holders of the 2008 Warrants to acquire the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property receivable in such event by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that might otherwise have been purchased upon the exercise of the 2008 Warrant. The 2008 Warrants also contain a full ratchet anti-dilution adjustment that is applicable upon the Company issuing certain stock or warrants for a consideration per share less than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the issuance or sale of such shares. No adjustment to the number of shares and exercise price of the shares subject to the Warrants will be made for dividends (other than stock dividends), if any, paid on the Company’s Common Stock as well as certain other events set forth in the 2008 Warrants. The Warrants do not confer upon holders any voting, dividend or other rights as shareholders of the Company. 2009 Warrants The following is a summary of certain provisions of the 2009 Warrants and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in all respects by reference to the actual text of the Warrants, the form of which was filed as an exhibit to Company’s Current Report on form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 16, 2009. Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase shares of the Common Stock at any time until five years after the date of issuance, at a per share price of $1.50. The exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including stock dividends, stock splits, combinations or reclassifications of the Common Stock. Additionally, an adjustment would be made in the case of a reclassification or exchange of Common Stock, consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation) or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in order to enable holders of the Warrants to acquire the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property receivable in such event by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that might otherwise have been purchased upon the exercise of the Warrant. No adjustment to the number of shares and exercise price of the shares subject to the Warrants will be made for dividends (other than stock dividends), if any, paid on the Company’s Common Stock as well as certain other events set forth in the Warrant. No fractional shares will be issued upon the exercise of the Warrants. The Warrants also contain full ratchet anti-dilution adjustment protection that is applicable upon the Company issuing certain stock or warrants for a consideration per share less than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the issuance or sale of such shares. Holders of warrants representing a majority of the underlying warrant shares may waive a price adjustment. The Warrants do not confer upon holders any voting, dividend or other rights as shareholders of the Company.

F-5 Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO INTERIM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2010 AND 2009 NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business Z Trim Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) manufactures a line of functional food ingredients that can be used to reduce costs, manage moisture, replace fats and deliver fiber to a wide variety of foods. The Company’s products can be used by food manufacturers and processors, restaurants, schools, and the general public worldwide. The Company continues to explore all available options for its other Z Trim technologies and related assets. The Company owns an exclusive license to Z Trim, a natural, agriculture-based functional food ingredient A summary of significant accounting policies follows. Presentation of Interim Information The financial information at March 31, 2010 is unaudited, but includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information set forth herein, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, such information does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2010 may not be indicative of results for the year ending December 31, 2010 or any future periods. Principle of Consolidation and Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Z Trim Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries after elimination of significantly all intercompany accounts and transactions. Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. In instances where the final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. No provisions were established for estimated product returns and allowances based on the Company’s historical experience. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Management of the Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages, management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. As of march 31, 2010 the allowance for doubtful accounts is $0. Accounting for Derivative Instruments All derivatives have been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value based on the lattice model calculation. These derivatives, including embedded derivatives in the Company’s warrants and its Convertible 8% Senior Secured Notes issued in 2010 and 2009, which have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants and notes, are separately valued and accounted for on the Company’s balance sheet. Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily available, fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment and estimates. Lattice Valuation Model The Company valued the conversion features and warrants in their convertible notes using a lattice valuation model, with the assistance of a valuation consultant. The lattice model values these instruments based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company uses the model to develop a set of potential scenarios. Probabilities of each scenario occurring during the remaining term of the debentures are determined based on management's projections. These probabilities are used to create a cash flow projection over the term of the instruments and determine the probability that the projected cash flow will be achieved. A discounted weighted average cash flow for each scenario is then calculated and compared to the discounted cash flow of the instruments without the compound embedded derivative in order to determine a value for the compound embedded derivative. Cash and cash equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. F-6 Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO INTERIM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2010 AND 2009 NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Fair value of financial instruments The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and long-term debt. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt also approximates fair value since their terms are similar to those in the lending market for comparable loans with comparable risks. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes. The Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs, including convertible debt with warrants attached. The Company reviews its warrants and conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and, if so, whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At March 31, 2010, the Company had convertible debt and warrants to purchase common stock, the fair values of which are classified as a liability. Some of these units have embedded conversion features that are treated as a discount on the notes. Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method. Inputs used in the valuation to derive fair value are classified based on a fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels: Level one — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use. Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company’s only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with the units consisting of convertible debt and warrants to purchase common stock (discussed above). The Company classifies the fair value of these warrants under level three. The fair value of the derivative liability at March 31, 2010 was $8,477,231, and the gain due to valuation for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $3,358,893. Concentrations Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk. Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on the accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives of five to ten years are used for machinery and equipment, office equipment and furniture, and automobile. Estimated useful lives of up to five years are used for computer equipment and related software. Depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements are computed using the term of the lease. Intangible Assets Intangible assets were carried at the purchased cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization was computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally from fifteen to twenty years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries are included in the consolidated federal income tax return filed by the Parent. The amount of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable is recognized as of the date of the financial statements, utilizing currently enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax expenses or benefits are recognized in the financial statements for the changes in deferred tax liabilities or assets between years. F-7 Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO INTERIM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2010 AND 2009 NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Advertising Costs The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. The amount for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $529. The amount for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $3,797. Income (Loss) Per Common Share Basic net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding and, when diluted, potential shares from options and warrants to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method. Diluted net loss per common share does not differ from basic net loss per common share since potential shares of common stock are anti-dilutive for all periods presented. Cashless Exercise of Warrants The Company has issued warrants to purchase common stock where the holder is entitled to exercise the warrant via a cashless exercise, when the exercise price is less than the fair value of the common stock. The Company accounts for the issuance of common stock on the cashless exercise of warrants on a net basis. Stock Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to employee stock purchase plans, on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We estimate the fair value of each share-based award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock-based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price. The Company recognized pre-tax compensation expense related to stock options of $684,434 and $543,339 the year ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Reverse Split Effective February 6, 2009, we had a 30 to 1 reverse stock split. All information in this Form 10-Q has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split as it took place as of the earliest period presented. New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new revenue recognition standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables, where certain of those deliverables are non-software related. The new standards permit entities to initially use management’s best estimate of selling price to value individual deliverables when those deliverables do not have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value or when third-party evidence is not available. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2010 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance establishing the Codification as the source of authoritative U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U. S. GAAP”) recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification will become non-authoritative. The FASB will no longer issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, the FASB will issue Accounting Standards Updates, which will serve only to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on changes in the Codification. All content in the Codification carries the same level of authority, and the U.S. GAAP hierarchy was modified to include only two levels of U.S. GAAP: authoritative and non-authoritative. The Codification is effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning with the Company’s year ending December 31, 2009. Adoption of the Codification affected disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements by eliminating references to previously issued accounting literature, such as SFASs, EITFs and FSPs. In June 2009, the FASB issued amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity. These new standards amend the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and require ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The provisions of the new standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the new standards will not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance establishing general standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued and shall be applied to subsequent events not addressed in other applicable generally accepted accounting principles. This guidance, among other things, sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Emerging Issue Task Force released a pronouncement related to determining whether an instrument (or imbedded Feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock. This became effective for the Company on March 31, 2009. The Company’s warrants and its Convertible 8% Senior Secured Notes issued in 2008 have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants and notes. The adoption of the pronouncement on January 1, 2009, the company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting in a reclassification of the Company’s outstanding warrants from stockholders’ equity to liabilities, which required the warrants to be fair valued at each reporting period, with the changes in fair value recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. At March 31, 2010, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $8,477,231, a change in the fair value – derivative liability of $3,358,893, and a loss on derivative of $325,928. NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. In the near term, the Company expects operating costs to continue to exceed funds generated from operations. As a result, the Company expects to continue to incur operating losses and may not have enough capital to grow its business in the future. The Company can give no assurance that it will achieve profitability or be capable of sustaining profitable operations. As a result, operations in the near future are expected to continue to use working capital. To successfully grow the business, the Company must decrease its cash outflows, improve its cash position and its revenue base, and succeed in its ability to raise additional capital through a combination of primarily public or private equity offerings or strategic alliances. The Company is currently in the process of obtaining additional financing for its current operations – See information on current financing in Note 6 herein below. F-8 Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO INTERIM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2010 AND 2009 NOTE 6 – CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE Private Placement Offerings On January 15, 2010, we entered into a private placement subscription agreement with Brightline Ventures I, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company(the "purchaser" or "Brightline") pursuant to which we sold 130 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $1,300,000. The Company has agreed to extend Brightline's right to invest an additional $1,200,000 on substantially similar terms until February 28, 2010. Since October 15, 2009, we have sold an additional 1.7 units for an aggregate offering price of $17,000, of which $12,000 was in return for forgiveness of rent owed to our landlord. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all of our assets for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement"). The Notes are convertible into a total of 1,317,000 shares of Common Stock exclusive of interest. The interest is payable in additional shares of the Company's Common Stock, quarterly or upon maturity of the Notes. The Investors also received one five-year warrant for each Unit purchased, to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the purchasers were 1,975,500. The terms and conditions of the Units are substantially identical to the terms and conditions and constitute a part of the units previously sold by us in 2009 and reported on a Form 8-K filed by us on October 16, 2009 (the "2009 Units"). Total accrued interest for the three months ended March 31, 2010 is $21,370. We also entered into registration rights agreements substantially similar to the registration rights agreement entered into with the purchasers of the 2008 Units pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants, with the exception that Brightline has agreed to suspend our obligation to do so until 45 days after we file our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, on or about October 14, 2009, the Company issued, pursuant to a consulting agreement, one five year warrant for the purchase of 10,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share. Between February 1 and March 31, 2010, we entered into a series of private placement subscription agreements with accredited investors (the "purchasers") pursuant to which we sold 29.6 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $296,000. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all of our assets for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement"). The Notes are convertible into a total of 496,000 shares of Common Stock exclusive of interest. The interest is payable in additional shares of the Company's Common Stock, quarterly or upon maturity of the Notes. The Investors also received one five-year warrant for each Unit purchased, to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the purchasers were 744,000. The terms and conditions of the Units are substantially identical to the terms and conditions and constitute a part of the units previously sold by us in 2009 and reported on a Form 8-K filed by us on October 16, 2009 (the "2009 Units"). Total accrued interest for the three months ended March 31, 2010 is $486. We also entered into registration rights agreements substantially similar to the registration rights agreement entered into with the purchasers of the 2008 Units pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants. The descriptions herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the forms of the Subscription Agreement, the Notes, the Warrant, the Security Agreements and the Registration Rights Agreement which are attached as exhibits to our Form 8-K filed on October 16, 2009. We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom. Amortization on Convertible Notes The Company recognized debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes in the amount of $811,058 for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and $1,449,214 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. In addition, the Company recognized debt discount amortization of $17,090 related to the conversion of $20,000 note payable balance. The $17,090 was offset by the derivative liability of $11,456 for a total loss of $5,634. NOTE 7 – LIQUIDATED DAMAGES In connection with certain private placements of the Company’s securities (the “Registrable Securities”) effected in 2008 the Company entered into registration rights agreements (the “RRA”) that required the Company to file a registration statement covering the Registrable Securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than thirty days after the final closing as contemplated in the Private Placement Memorandum for the 2008 offering (the “Filing Deadline”). The Company filed a registration statement on December 14, 2009. However, the statement has not been declared effective as the Company is not S-3 eligible and will need to file an amended filing to convert the S-3 to an S-1. Management intends to file the S-1 after it files the 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. Under the terms of the registration rights agreement, as partial compensation, the Company was required to make pro rata payments to each Investor in an amount equal to 1.5% of the aggregate amount invested by such Investor for each 30-day period or pro rata for any portion thereof following the Filing Deadline for which no registration statement was filed. We obtained a release and waiver of the amounts due from 74 of the 2008 investors. As of May 20, 2010, there are 5 investors who have yet to sign the release and waiver. Under the terms of the RRA, as of that date we potentially owe, and recognized as liquidated damages, the additional amount of $20,025 for a total accrual of $100,125. F-10 Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO INTERIM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2010 AND 2009 NOTE 8 – DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES The Company’s warrants and its Convertible 8% Senior Secured Notes issued in 2008, 2009 and 2010 have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants and notes. This ratchet provision results in a derivative liability in our financial statements. Our derivative liabilities decreased from $10,285,578 at March 31, 2010 to $8,477,231 at December 31, 2009. The change in fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2010 is $3,038,599 and the loss on derivative settlement is $325,928.

Under the Investment Banking Agreement, we also agreed to give Legend unlimited "piggy back" registration rights with respect to the shares of our common stock in any registration statement filed by us in connection with an underwritten offering of our common stock. We determined that all of the securities issued pursuant to the agreement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom.

The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and believes that the risk of any loss is minimal. NOTE 12 – COMMITMENTS Building Lease The Company leases a combined production and office facility located in Mundelein, Illinois. The facility is approximately 44,000 square feet. The Company extended the lease until March 2011 and the required monthly rental payments increased to $21,000, exclusive of property taxes. The Company also is responsible for payment of all property taxes. Insurance and maintenance are billed when due. If we were to lose this lease or not be able to extend our lease due to the specific requirements of our Company, the outcome to our operations could be substantial. The Company recognizes escalating lease expense on a straight line basis in accordance with current accounting guidance. For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, the Company recognized rent expense of $48,420 and $56,922. The future minimum annual rental payments and sub-lease income for the years ended December 31 under the lease terms are as follows: Year Ended Rentals 2011 252,000 2012 42,000 2013 - 2014 2012 - $ 294,000 During the first quarter of 2010, the Company entered into two equipment leases for plant equipment. The equipment is to be delivered during the second quarter. The Company shall have the option to purchase the equipment at the end of each lease. The first lease is for a minimum of 6 months at $10,000 per month, with a purchase price of $108,000 (the rental payments would be applied to the purchase price). The second lease is for 18 months at $24,167 per month, with a $100,000 up front payment. The purchase price of the equipment is $535,006, and both the initial and rental payments would be applied to the purchase price. F-13 Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO INTERIM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2010 AND 2009 NOTE 13 – PENDING LITIGATION/ CONTINGENT LIABILITY On July 7, 2007, the Company was served with a complaint by Joseph Sanfilippo and James Cluck for violation of the Consumer Fraud Act and is seeking damages in excess of $200,000. Management believes that the allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit and will vigorously defend the claim. The Company currently has a Motion to Dismiss pending in the Circuit Court, Twentieth Judicial Circuit, St. Clair County, Illinois. The pleadings are still at issue and discovery is just getting underway. Thus, the outcome is unknown as of the report date. On August 4, 2009, the Company was served with a complaint by Daniel Caravette, alleging the Company breached the parties’ settlement agreement dated April 24, 2008 and seeking damages in excess of $75,000. Management believes that the allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit and will vigorously defend the claim. The case is set for trial in July of 2010 before the Circuit Court of the Nineteenth Judicial District, Lake County, Illinois. A defense motion for summary judgment is pending and undetermined as of the report date. NOTE 14 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In 2009, two of the Company’s external Directors, Mark Hershhorn and Brian Israel each agreed to apply $20,000 of unpaid Directors’ fees (80% of which is past due), to the purchase of Units pursuant to the terms of the convertible notes set forth in Note 6 hereinabove. Further, our third external director, Morris Garfinkle, also invested $50,000 in the offering. NOTE 15 – GUARANTEES The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which the Company may provide customary indemnifications to purchasers of the Company’s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising from the Company’s use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company's officers, directors and employees, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on its consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2010. In general, the Company offers a one-year warranty for most of the products it sold. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs associated with these warranties. NOTE 17 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Between April 1 and 3, 2010, we sold 9.7 units. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all of our assets for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement"). The Notes are convertible into a total of 97,000 shares of Common Stock exclusive of interest. The interest is payable in additional shares of the Company's Common Stock, quarterly or upon maturity of the Notes. The Investors also received one five-year warrant for each Unit purchased, to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the purchasers were 145,500. The terms and conditions of the Units are substantially identical to the terms and conditions and constitute a part of the units previously sold by us in 2009 and reported on a Form 8-K filed by us on October 16, 2009 (the "2009 Units"). On or about May 10, 2010, the Company rescinded all stock options issued in 2009 that had an exercise price below $1.00. In total 1,320,000 stock options were rescinded. In consideration for such, the Company issued 1,882,500 stock options to employees, of which 1,567,500 were issued with an exercise price of $1.01, and 315,000 were issued with an exercise price of $1.10. On April 30, 2010, the Company issued 55,841 shares of its common stock to a note holder for conversion of principal of $50,000 and accrued interest of $5,841. On April 20, 2010, the Company issued 12,308 shares of its common stock for the exercise of 12,308 warrants with an exercise price of $1.00. F-14 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Z Trim Holdings, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Z Trim Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Z Trim Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has suffered recurring losses from operations and requires additional financing to continue in operation. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. /s/ M&K CPAs,PLLC Houston, Texas April 9, 2010 F-15 Z TRIM HOLDINGS, INC.

F-20 160; Z Trim Holdings, Inc. Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS Nature of Business Z Trim Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) manufactures a line of functional food ingredients that can be used to reduce costs, manage moisture, replace fats and deliver fiber to a wide variety of foods. The Company’s products can be used by food manufacturers and processors, restaurants, schools, and the general public worldwide. The Company continues to explore all available options for its other Z Trim technologies and related assets. The Company owns an exclusive license to Z Trim, a natural, agriculture-based functional food ingredient. NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. In the near term, the Company expects operating costs to continue to exceed funds generated from operations. As a result, the Company expects to continue to incur operating losses and may not have enough capital to grow its business in the future or continue as a going concern. The Company can give no assurance that it will achieve profitability or be capable of sustaining profitable operations. As a result, operations in the near future are expected to continue to use working capital. To successfully grow the business, the Company must decrease its cash outflows, improve its cash position and its revenue base, and succeed in its ability to raise additional capital through a combination of primarily public or private equity offerings or strategic alliances. The Company is currently in the process of trying to obtain additional financing for its current operations. NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. In instances where the final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. No provisions were established for estimated product returns and allowances based on the Company’s historical experience. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Management of the Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages, management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. As of December 31, 2009, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0. As of December 31, 2008 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $10,067. Cash and cash equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on the accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives of five to ten years are used for machinery and equipment, office equipment and furniture, and automobile. Estimated useful lives of up to five years are used for computer equipment and related software. Depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements are computed using the term of the lease. F-21 Z Trim Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cont. Deferred Loan Costs Loan acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the applicable indebtedness using the effective interest method. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are carried at the purchased cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally from fifteen to twenty years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries are included in the consolidated federal income tax return filed by the Parent. The amount of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable is recognized as of the date of the financial statements, utilizing currently enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax expenses or benefits are recognized in the financial statements for the changes in deferred tax liabilities or assets between years. Principle of Consolidation and Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Z Trim Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries after elimination of significantly all intercompany accounts and transactions. Accounting for Derivative Instruments All derivatives have been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value based on the lattice model calculation. These derivatives, including embedded derivatives in the Company’s warrants and its Convertible 8% Senior Secured Notes issued in 2008 and 2009, which have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants and notes, are separately valued and accounted for on the Company’s balance sheet. Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily available, fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment and estimates. Lattice Valuation Model The Company valued the conversion features and warrants in their convertible notes using a lattice valuation model, with the assistance of a valuation consultant. The lattice model values these instruments based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company uses the model to develop a set of potential scenarios. Probabilities of each scenario occurring during the remaining term of the debentures are determined based on management's projections. These probabilities are used to create a cash flow projection over the term of the instruments and determine the probability that the projected cash flow will be achieved. A discounted weighted average cash flow for each scenario is then calculated and compared to the discounted cash flow of the instruments without the compound embedded derivative in order to determine a value for the compound embedded derivative. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and long-term debt. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt also approximates fair value since their terms are similar to those in the lending market for comparable loans with comparable risks. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes. The Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs, including convertible debt with warrants attached. The Company reviews its warrants and conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and, if so, whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At December 31, 2009, the Company had convertible debt and warrants to purchase common stock, the fair values of which are classified as a liability. Some of these units have embedded conversion features that are treated as a discount on the notes. Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method. Inputs used in the valuation to derive fair value are classified based on a fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels: · Level one — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; · Level two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and · Level three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use. Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company’s only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with the units consisting of convertible debt and warrants to purchase common stock (discussed above). The Company classifies the fair value of these warrants under level three. The fair value of the derivative liability at December 31, 2009 was $10,285,578, and the loss due to valuation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $3,623,519. Advertising Costs The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. The amount for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $13,953 and $55,981 respectively. Income (Loss) Per Common Share Basic net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding and, when diluted, potential shares from options and warrants to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method. Diluted net loss per common share does not differ from basic net loss per common share since potential shares of common stock are anti-dilutive for all periods presented. F-22 Z Trim Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cont. Cashless Exercise of Warrants The Company has issued warrants to purchase common stock where the holder is entitled to exercise the warrant via a cashless exercise. The Company accounts for the issuance of common stock on the cashless exercise of warrants on a net basis. Stock Based Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to employee stock purchase plans, on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We estimate the fair value of each share-based award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock-based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price. T he Company recognized pre-tax compensation expense related to stock options of $565,848 and $40,613for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Reverse Split Effective February 6, 2009, we had a 30 to 1 reverse stock split. All information in this Form 10-K has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split as it took place as of the earliest period presented. New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new revenue recognition standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables, where certain of those deliverables are non-software related. The new standards permit entities to initially use management’s best estimate of selling price to value individual deliverables when those deliverables do not have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value or when third-party evidence is not available. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2010 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance establishing the Codification as the source of authoritative U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U. S. GAAP”) recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification will become non-authoritative. The FASB will no longer issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, the FASB will issue Accounting Standards Updates, which will serve only to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on changes in the Codification. All content in the Codification carries the same level of authority, and the U.S. GAAP hierarchy was modified to include only two levels of U.S. GAAP: authoritative and non-authoritative. The Codification is effective for the Company’s interim and annual periods beginning with the Company’s year ending December 31, 2009. Adoption of the Codification affected disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements by eliminating references to previously issued accounting literature, such as SFASs, EITFs and FSPs. In June 2009, the FASB issued amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity. These new standards amend the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and require ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The provisions of the new standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the new standards will not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance establishing general standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued and shall be applied to subsequent events not addressed in other applicable generally accepted accounting principles. This guidance, among other things, sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Emerging Issue Task Force released a pronouncement related to determining whether an instrument (or imbedded Feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock. This became effective for the Company on March 31, 2009. The Company’s warrants and its Convertible 8% Senior Secured Notes issued in 2008 have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants and notes. The adoption of the pronouncement on January 1, 2009, the company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting in a reclassification of the Company’s outstanding warrants from stockholders’ equity to liabilities, which required the warrants to be fair valued at each reporting period, with the changes in fair value recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $10,285,578 and a change in the fair value – derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2009 of ($3,623,519).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 NOTE 8–CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE 2009 Convertible Notes On April 15, 2009, we entered into private placement subscription agreements pursuant to which we sold 24.2 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $242,000. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all assets of the Company for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement filed as an exhibit to this report. The Notes are convertible into a total of 242,000 shares of Common Stock. The interest is payable upon maturity of the Notes. Investors of each Unit also received one five-year warrant, one to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the note-holders were 383,000. As part of the aggregate, two of the Company's external Directors, Mark Hershhorn and Brian Israel each agreed to apply $20,000 of unpaid Directors' fees (80% of which is past due), to the purchase of Units pursuant to the terms of the offering set forth above. Further, our third external director, Morris Garfinkle, also invested $50,000 in the offering. As a result of the conversion rate being set at $1.00 for these agreements, the conversion rate for the convertible notes and $4.80 warrants entered into by the company in June, September and November of 2008 are automatically reset to $1.00. The impact of this change is that the number of shares that could be obtained by converting the June, September and November 2008 notes increases from 928,541 to 4,456,997, and the interest shares (if the holders elect to be paid in shares instead of cash) on such notes increases from 148,566 to 713,117. We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom. On April 27, 2009, the Company entered into an Investment Banking Agreement with Legend Securities, Inc. ("Legend"), pursuant to which Legend agreed to provide business advisory services to us for a period of up to twelve months. In exchange for Legend's services, we agreed to issue Legend a warrant to purchase 350,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share equal to $1.10 per share. The warrant will vest as to 87,500 of the warrant shares upon issuance, and then at a rate of 87,500 shares per quarter starting on the quarterly anniversary of issuance, and will be exercisable for a period of five years. Under the Investment Banking Agreement, we also agreed to give Legend unlimited "piggy back" registration rights with respect to the shares of our common stock underlying the warrant in any registration statement filed by us in connection with an underwritten offering of our common stock. The Company recorded the fair value of the above warrants as warrant expense in the amount of $243,238 using the lattice valuation model. The amount is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses of $4,729,683 at December 31, 2009. The Company also included the warrants in the derivative liabilities valuation as they contained a reset provision to the exercise and conversion prices. We determined that all of the securities issued pursuant to the agreement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom. Between May 1 and May 14, 2009, we entered into private placement subscription agreements pursuant to which we sold 38.5 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $385,000. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all assets of the Company for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement filed as an exhibit to this report. The Notes are convertible into a total of 385,000 shares of Common Stock. The interest is payable upon maturity of the Notes. Investors of each Unit also received one five-year warrant, one to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the note-holders were 577,500. The terms of the offering are identical to those announced on the Company's Form 8-K, dated April 21, 2009. The description of the terms of sale of the securities described in this report is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underlying documents which have been filed as exhibits to the April 21, 2009 Form 8-K. On May 1, 2009, we entered into private placement subscription agreements pursuant to which we sold 6 units consisting of shares of common stock and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $60,000. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of 10,000 shares of unregistered common stock plus one five-year warrant, one to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). A total of 60,000 shares of common stock and 90,000 warrants are to be issued pursuant to the terms of this offering. All such Units were sold pursuant to an agreement with an equipment supplier whereby the Company agreed to apply $60,000 of unpaid and past due amounts towards the purchase and installation of two boilers, to the purchase of the 6 Units. The equipment supplier agreed to accept such Units as payment for the $60,000 of unpaid and past due amounts. On May 13, 2009, the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement with its patent litigation counsel, whereby the Company agreed to apply $350,000 of unpaid and past due legal fees owed to such counsel, to the purchase of 35 Units pursuant to the terms of the offering set forth above. The patent litigation counsel agreed to accept such Units as payment for the $350,000 of unpaid and past due legal fees. These Units are included in the totals set forth in the first paragraph above. We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom.

Between May 18 and July 15, 2009, we entered into private placement subscription agreements pursuant to which we sold 49.75 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $497,500. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all assets of the Company for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement filed as an exhibit to to the April 21, 2009 Form 8-K. The Notes are convertible into a total of 497,500 shares of Common Stock. The interest is payable upon maturity of the Notes. Investors of each Unit also received one five-year warrant, one to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the note-holders were 746,250. The terms of the offering are identical to those announced on the Company's Form 8-K, dated April 21, 2009. The description of the terms of sale of the securities described in this report is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underlying documents which have been filed as exhibits to the April 21, 2009 Form 8-K. On June 29, 2009, the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement with its landlord, whereby the Company agreed to apply $130,000 of unpaid and past due rent owed to such landlord, to the purchase of 13 Units pursuant to the terms of the offering set forth above. The landlord agreed to accept such Units as payment for the $130,000 of unpaid and past due rent. These Units are included in the totals set forth in the paragraph above. We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom. On October 15, 2009, we entered into a private placement subscription agreement with Brightline Ventures I, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company(the "purchaser" or "Brightline") pursuant to which we sold 185.25 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $1,852,500. Furthermore, since July 14, 2009, we had sold an additional 75.3 units for an aggregate offering price of $753,000, including a total of $660,000 sold to affiliates of Brightline. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all of our assets for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement filed as an exhibit to this report (the "Security Agreement"). The Notes are convertible into a total of 2,605,500 shares of Common Stock. The interest is payable quarterly or upon maturity of the Notes. The Investors also received one five-year warrant for each Unit purchased, to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the purchaser and its affiliates were 3,768,750. The Company has agreed to pay a finder cash commissions aggregating 8% of the gross proceeds of the offering sold to an investor introduced by that finder up to a maximum of 250 Units purchased by such investor and an equal amount of five year warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 per share (for example, if the finder's fee equals $200,000, then the finder will also receive 200,000 warrants with an exercise price of $1.50). The Company has reserved the right to negotiate a lower commission for any Units above the 250 purchased by such investor. The terms and conditions of the Units are substantially identical to the terms and conditions and constitute a part of the units previously sold by us in 2009 and reported on a Form 8-K filed by us on April 21, 2009 (the "2009 Units"). The amount of Units purchased by Brightline and its affiliates, represents at least a majority of all of the Units and the 2009 Units taken as a whole, and, consequently, under the terms of the Notes, the purchaser has the ability, together with us to amend the Notes and Security Agreements comprising the Units and the 2009 Units. In consideration of Brightline's (and its affiliates') purchase of Note Units in the amount of $2,512,500 pursuant to the terms of the Note Memorandum, the Company granted to Brightline, the right to purchase additional Note Units and/or Preferred Stock Units, as available, up to an additional aggregate amount of $2,487,500. Pursuant to the terms of the subscription agreement we agreed with the Purchaser to amend the Units (the "Amended Units") to reflect the terms and conditions of the Units sold by us in 2008 (the "2008 Units") as described in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on June 24 and September 2, 2008 which include among other things a full ratchet anti-dilution formulation with respect to the adjustments to the conversion price of the Notes and the exercise price of the Warrants instead of the weighted average anti-dilution formula contained in the Units and the payment of interest on the Notes, at the option of the holder, quarterly or at maturity rather than just at maturity. As a result of the amendment, all of the Notes and the 2009 Notes and corresponding Security Agreements will be amended to read as set forth in Exhibits 4.2 and 4.4 attached hereto. The Warrants sold to the purchaser have also been amended. We also agreed to offer to amend the warrants and to offer a registration rights agreement to the noteholders under the 2009 Units on terms identical to those granted to the purchaser. The Notes, the Amended and Restated Notes (including the Notes issued as part of the 2009 Units) and Notes issued as part of the 2008 Units rank pari passu with each other. We also entered into registration rights agreements substantially similar to the registration rights agreement entered into with the purchasers of the 2008 Units pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Amended and Restated Notes and the Amended and Restated Warrants. The descriptions herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the forms of the Subscription Agreement, the Amended and Restated Notes, the Amended and Restated Warrant, the Amended and Restated Security Agreements and the Registration Rights Agreement which are attached as exhibits to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 16, 2009. We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom. For the period ending December 31, 2009, the 2009 Notes have a debt discount in the amount of $3,747,000. The warrants value and the beneficial conversion value are discounted against the Notes and are being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Notes. The warrant and beneficial conversion feature exceeded the face value of the note and the total amortization for the twelve months ending December 31, 2009 is $479,412 resulting in a remaining discount of $3,267,588. 2008 Convertible Notes On June 18, 2008, the Company issued 8% Convertible Senior Secured Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,400,000 (“Notes”). On September 2, 2008, the Company entered into private placement subscription agreements pursuant to which we sold 23.7 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $2,370,000. On November 12, 2008, we entered into private placement subscription agreements pursuant to which we sold 6.87 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $687,000. The Notes mature in two years from date of issuance. The Notes and accrued interest are payable in full at maturity. All amounts due under the Notes may be converted at any time, in part or in whole, at the written election of the holder thereof, into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. The Notes are secured by a first priority perfected interest in all the assets of the Company. We determined that all of the securities issued pursuant to the agreement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption there from. For the period ending December 31, 2009, the 2008 Notes have a beneficial conversion feature, which have a value of $1,897,264. The warrants value and the beneficial conversion value are discounted against the Notes and are being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Notes. The warrant and beneficial conversion feature exceeded the face value of the note and the total amortization for the twelve months ending December 31, 2009 is $969,802 resulting in a remaining discount of $927,462.

Amortization on Convertible Notes For the twelve months ending December 31, 2009, the Company recognized debt discount amortization in the amount of $1,449,214. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2008, the Company recognized debt discount amortization in the amount of $350,520. The convertible note payable balance as of December 31, 2009 of $8,204,000, excluding the debt discount of $4,195,050, matures as follows: Year Ended Principal 2010 4,457,000 2011 3,747,000 2012 - 2013 - 2014 - Total 8,204,000 NOTE 9- LIQUIDATED DAMAGES Liquidated Damages In connection with certain private placements of the Company’s securities (the “Registrable Securities”) effected in 2008 the Company entered into registration rights agreements (the “RRA”) that required the Company to file a registration statement covering the Registrable Securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than thirty days after the final closing as contemplated in the Private Placement Memorandum for the 2008 offering (the “Filing Deadline”). The Company filed a registration statement on December 14, 2009. However, the statement has not been declared effective as the Company is not S-3 eligible and will need to file an amended filing to convert the S-3 to an S-1. Management intends to file the S-1 after it files the 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. Under the terms of the registration rights agreement, as partial compensation, the Company was required to make pro rata payments to each Investor in an amount equal to 1.5% of the aggregate amount invested by such Investor for each 30-day period or pro rata for any portion thereof following the Filing Deadline for which no registration statement was filed. We obtained a release and waiver of the amounts due from 74 of the 2008 investors. As of April 5, 2010, there are 5 investors who have yet to sign the release and waiver. Under the terms of the RRA, as of that date we potentially owe, and recognized as liquidated damages, the amount of $80,100. NOTE 10 –DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES The Company’s warrants and its Convertible 8% Senior Secured Notes issued in 2008 and 2009 have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants and notes. This ratchet provision results in a derivative liability in our financial statements. Our derivative liabilities increased from $0 at December 31, 2008 to $10,285,578 at December 31, 2009. As of January 1, 2009, the fair value of these warrants of $2,219,530 was recognized and resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit of $86,002,406. The change in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2009 of $4,319,048. $3,623,519 is recorded as a derivative loss, $632,982 is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses for warrants issued for services, and $62,547 is included in settlement loss for warrants issued for accounts payable.

Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of 10,000 shares of unregistered common stock plus one five-year warrant, one to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). A total of 60,000 shares of common stock and 90,000 warrants are to be issued pursuant to the terms of this offering. All such Units were sold pursuant to an agreement with an equipment supplier whereby the Company agreed to apply $60,000 of unpaid and past due amounts towards the purchase and installation of two boilers, to the purchase of the 6 Units. The equipment supplier agreed to accept such Units as payment for the $60,000 of unpaid and past due amounts. On June 29, 2009, the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement with its landlord, whereby the Company agreed to apply $130,000 of unpaid and past due rent owed to such landlord, to the purchase of 13 Units pursuant to the terms of the offering set forth above. The landlord agreed to accept such Units as payment for the $130,000 of unpaid and past due rent. The amount of the settlement losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $103,137, comprised of the fair value of the investments, above the debts owed by the Company, made by the equipment supplier and landlord as set forth above. The Company executed an agreement with Farhad Zaghi on February 8, 2008.

The Company agreed to pay $50,000 cash, and to provide 8,166 shares of unrestricted common stock with a fair value of $63,700 and 6,666 three-year warrants at a strike price of $7.80, with a fair value of $33,326, in exchange for a release of all claims.

All other obligations between the parties have been mutually resolved and neither party has admitted wrong-doing or liability of any kind. The amount of the settlement losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $772,202 for the three afore-mentioned agreements. NOTE 14 – INCOME TAXES During 2009 and 2008, the Company incurred net losses, and therefore had no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net loss carry forward is approximately $64,822,705 and $52,613,125 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively, and will expire in the years 2019 through 2028. At December 31, 2009, the net deferred tax asset consisted of the following: Net Operating Loss $18,727,333 Less: Valuation allowance ($18,272,333) Net Deferred tax asset $_____0_____ After evaluating our own potential tax uncertainties, the Company has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions that have a greater than 50% likelihood of reversal if the Company were to be audited. Our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2009 may be subject to IRS audit. NOTE 15 – MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATIONS The Company’s customers are food manufacturers, school districts and the general public. There were three significant customers who accounted for 20%, 20% and 14% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2009. There were two significant customers who accounted for 37% and 13% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Further, two significant customers accounted for 78% and 11% of the total accounts receivable for the year ended December 31, 2009. Two significant customers accounted for 80% and 6% of the total accounts receivable for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company maintains cash deposits with major banks, which from time to time may exceed federally insured limits. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $324,874 and $492,696 a, respectively, were in excess of federally insured limits. The Company periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and believes that the risk of any loss is minimal. NOTE 16 – COMMITMENTS Building Lease The Company leases a combined production and office facility located in Mundelein, Illinois. The facility is approximately 44,000 square feet. The Company extended the lease until March 2010 and the required monthly rental payments increased to $21,000, exclusive of property taxes. The Company also is responsible for payment of all property taxes. Insurance and maintenance are billed when due. If we were to lose this lease or not be able to extend our lease due to the specific requirements of our Company, the outcome to our operations could be substantial. The Company also leased a 5,000 square foot warehouse in Mundelein, Illinois. The lease commenced on August 1, 2007 and was terminated in October of 2009. The monthly net rent was $2,834. The Company recognizes escalating lease expense on a straight line basis in accordance with current accounting standards. The future minimum annual rental payments and sub-lease income for the years ended December 31 under the lease terms are as follows: Year Ended Rentals 2010 252,000 2011 63,000 2012 - 2013 - $ 315,000 The total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, was $351,472 and $286,415. F-30 ; Z Trim Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 NOTE 17– PENDING LITIGATION/ CONTINGENT LIABILITY On July 7, 2007, the Company was served with a complaint by Joseph Sanfilippo and James Cluck for violation of the Consumer Fraud Act and is seeking damages in excess of $200,000. Management believes that the allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit and will vigorously defend the claim. The Company currently has a Motion to Dismiss pending in the Circuit Court, Twentieth Judicial Circuit, St. Clair County, Illinois. The pleadings are still at issue and discovery is just getting underway, however, a potential loss is unlikely. On August 4, 2009, the Company was served with a complaint by Daniel Caravette, alleging the Company breached the parties’ settlement agreement dated April 24, 2008 and seeking damages in excess of $75,000. Management believes that the allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit and will vigorously defend the claim. The case is set for trial in July of 2010 before the Circuit Court of the Nineteenth Judicial District, Lake County, Illinois. A defense motion for summary judgement is pending and a potential loss is unlikely. NOTE 18 – GUARANTEES The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which the Company may provide customary indemnifications to purchasers of the Company’s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising from the Company’s use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company's officers, directors and employees, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. In general, the Company offers a one-year warranty for most of the products it sold. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs associated with these warranties. NOTE 19 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Two of the Company’s external Directors, Mark Hershhorn and Brian Israel each agreed to apply $20,000 of unpaid Directors’ fees (80% of which is past due), to the purchase of Units pursuant to the terms of the convertible notes set forth in Note 8 hereinabove. Further, our third external director, Morris Garfinkle, also invested $50,000 in the offering. NOTE 20 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent events were evaluated through the report date, April 9, 2010. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company has issued 237,428 shares of its common stock for the cashless exercise of warrants. On January 4, 2010, a convertible note holder elected to convert principal of $20,000 and interest of $762 at a conversion price of $1.00 into 20,762 shares of common stock. On January 4, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 30,000 shares of common stock to four of the five Company’s board of directors for a total of 120,000 shares of common stock. The total fair value of the common stock is $234,000 based at the closing price at date of grant. On January 7, 2010 the Legend and Z Trim agreed to mutually terminate that agreement, and to cancel the Company's obligation to issue the 350,000 warrants. In return, the Company has agreed to issue Legends 100,000 shares of Common Stock. The total value of the common stock is $140,000 based at the closing price at date of grant. Also on January 7, 2010, the parties entered into a new Investment Banking Agreement with Legend, pursuant to which Legend agreed to provide business advisory services for us for a period of up to twelve months. In exchange for Legend's services, we agreed to pay Legend the sum of $6,250 per month, as well as a one-time fee of 250,000 shares of Common Stock valued at $350,000 based on the closing price on January 7, 2010. Under the Investment Banking Agreement, we also agreed to give Legend unlimited "piggy back" registration rights with respect to the shares of our common stock in any registration statement filed by us in connection with an underwritten offering of our common stock. On January 15, 2010, we entered into a private placement subscription agreement with Brightline Ventures I, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company(the "purchaser" or "Brightline") pursuant to which we sold 130 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $1,300,000. The Company has agreed to extend Brightline's right to invest an additional $1,200,000 on substantially similar terms until February 28, 2010. Since October 15, 2009, we have sold an additional 1.7 units for an aggregate offering price of $17,000, of which $12,000 was in return for forgiveness of rent owed to our landlord. Each of the units (individually, a "Unit" and collectively, the "Units") consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes") convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the "Common Stock"), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all of our assets for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement"). The Notes are convertible into a total of 1,317,000 shares of Common Stock exclusive of interest. The interest is payable in additional shares of the Company's Common Stock, quarterly or upon maturity of the Notes. The Investors also received one five-year warrant for each Unit purchased, to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share ("Warrants"). The total warrants issued to the purchasers were 1,975,500. The terms and conditions of the Units are substantially identical to the terms and conditions and constitute a part of the units previously sold by us in 2009 and reported on a Form 8-K filed by us on October 16, 2009 (the "2009 Units"). On January 19, 2010, the Company issued 1,377,000 employee stock options. On January 25, 2010, the Company issued an additional 115,000 employee stock options. Between February 1 and April 1, 2010, we entered into a series of private placement subscription agreements with accredited investors (the “purchasers”) pursuant to which we sold 39.9 units consisting of convertible notes and warrants, for an aggregate offering price of $399,000. Each of the units (individually, a “Unit” and collectively, the “Units”) consists of a $10,000 24-month senior secured promissory note (each a “Note” and collectively the “Notes”) convertible at the rate of $1.00 per share into 10,000 shares of our common stock, $.00005 par value (the “Common Stock”), bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which interest is accrued annually in Common Stock at the rate of $1.00 per share. The Notes will be secured by a first lien on all of our assets for so long as the Notes remain outstanding pursuant to the form of Security Agreement (the “Security Agreement”). The Notes are convertible into a total of 399,000 shares of Common Stock exclusive of interest. The interest is payable in additional shares of the Company's Common Stock, quarterly or upon maturity of the Notes. The Investors also received one five-year warrant for each Unit purchased, to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock per unit with an exercise price of $1.50 per share (“Warrants”). The total warrants issued to the purchasers were 598,500. The terms and conditions of the Units are substantially identical to the terms and conditions and constitute a part of the units previously sold by us in 2009 and reported on a Form 8-K filed by us on October 16, 2009 (the “2009 Units”). We also entered into registration rights agreements substantially similar to the registration rights agreement entered into with the purchasers of the 2008 Units pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants. The descriptions herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the forms of the Subscription Agreement, the Notes, the Warrant, the Security Agreements and the Registration Rights Agreement which are attached as exhibits to our Form 8-K filed on October 16, 2009. We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were “accredited investors” within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom. F-31 PART II INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS ITEM 13. OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION We are not issuing any common stock under this Registration Statement. All Common Stock registered pursuant to this Registration Statement is being registered on behalf of Selling Shareholders. We have agreed to pay all costs of this Registration Statement. The following table sets forth the estimated expenses to be incurred in connection with the issuance and resale of the securities offered by this prospectus. We are responsible for the payment of all expenses set forth below. Registration fee $ 1507.24 Legal fees and expenses $ 25,000.00 Accounting fees and expenses $ 5,000.00 Miscellaneous $ 492.76 Total $ 32,000.00 ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The Company’s bylaws authorize the Company to indemnify directors and officers and other corporate agents to the fullest extent permitted under the laws of Illinois. Because indemnification of liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers or controlling persons by these provisions or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission this indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of the issue.

We also entered into registration rights agreements substantially similar to the registration rights agreement entered into with the purchasers of the 2008 Units, described below, pursuant to which we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the 2009 Notes and 2009 Warrants. The Company agreed to pay a finder cash commissions aggregating 8% of the gross proceeds of the offering sold to an investor introduced by that finder up to a maximum of 250 Units purchased by such investor and an equal amount of five year warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 per share Pursuant to the terms of the subscription agreement with a purchaser who acquired a majority of the 2009 Units we agreed to amend the 2009 Units (the "Amended Units") to reflect the terms and conditions of the Units sold by us in 2008 (the "2008 Units") as described below and in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on June 24 and September 2, 2008 which include among other things a full ratchet anti-dilution formulation with respect to the adjustments to the conversion price of the Notes and the exercise price of the Warrants instead of the weighted average anti-dilution formula contained in the original 2009 Units and the payment of interest on the Notes, at the option of the holder, quarterly or at maturity rather than just at maturity. As a result of the amendment, the 2009 Warrants, 2009 Notes and corresponding Security Agreements were amended. The 2008 Notes, the Amended and Restated Notes (including the Notes issued as part of the 2009 Units) rank pari passu with each other. We agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to nominate a representative of the purchaser for election to our Board of Directors and we also agreed subject to certain conditions to permit an observer designated by the purchaser to attend meetings of the Board The descriptions herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the forms of the Subscription Agreement, the Notes, the Warrant, the Security Agreements and the Registration Rights Agreement which are attached as exhibits to our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on October 16, May 14, and April 21, 2009 and incorporated herein. On May 13, 2009, the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement with its patent litigation counsel, whereby the Company agreed to apply $350,000 of unpaid and past due legal fees owed to such counsel, to the purchase of 35 2009 Units pursuant to the terms of the offering set forth above. The patent litigation counsel agreed to accept such Units as payment for the $350,000 of unpaid and past due legal fees. These Units are included in the totals set forth in the first paragraph above. As part of the aggregate 2009 Units, two of the Company's external Directors, Mark Hershhorn and Brian Israel each agreed to apply $20,000 of unpaid Directors' fees (80% of which is past due), to the purchase of Units pursuant to the terms of the offering set forth above. Further, our third external director, Morris Garfinkle, also invested $50,000 in the offering. On June 29, 2009, the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement with its landlord, whereby the Company agreed to apply $130,000 of unpaid and past due rent owed to such landlord, to the purchase of 13 of the 2009 Units pursuant to the terms of the offering set forth above. The landlord agreed to accept such Units as payment for the $130,000 of unpaid and past due rent. These Units are included in the totals set forth in the first paragraph above Additionally, on or about October 14, 2009, the Company issued, pursuant to a consulting agreement, one five year warrant for the purchase of 10,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share As a result of the conversion rate being set at $1.00 for these agreements, the conversion rate for the convertible notes and $4.80 warrants entered into by the company in June, September and November of 2008 are automatically reset to $1.00. The impact of this change is that the number of shares that could be obtained by converting the June, September and November 2008 notes increases from 928,541 to 4,456,997, and the interest shares (if the holders elect to be paid in shares instead of cash) on such notes increases from 148,566 to 713,117. II-1 We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom. In February 2008, in connection with its settlement of its litigation with Farhad Zaghi and related parties the Company agreed in addition to the issuance of 100,000 shares of our common stock, to issue and register for resale a three year warrant to purchase an additional 83,333 shares of the Company’s common stock. The warrant is immediately exercisable, with a variable exercise price equal to the lowest twelve-trading-day average closing price of the Company’s common stock during the period between the date of issuance and date of notice of exercise. The description of the terms of sale of the securities described above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underlying documents filed as an exhibit to this registration statement. In April 2008, the Company settled a case with a former employee, Daniel Caravette. The Company agreed to pay $50,000 cash, and to provide 8,166 shares of common stock and 6,666 three-year warrants at a strike price of $7.80, with a fair value of $33,326, in exchange for a release of all claims. On August 29, 2008, in connection with a settlement of outstanding litigation with George Foreman Enterprises, the Company issued to George Foreman Enterprises a total of 100,000 shares of the company's common stock. On various dates commencing June 18, through November 3, 2008, the Company issued 8% Convertible Senior Secured Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4,457,000 (“2008 Notes”). Interest is accrued quarterly at the rate of 8% per annum in shares of common stock of the Company at $1.00 per share. Upon the event of a default, the stated interest rate of the Notes will be increased to 18% per annum. The terms of the Notes require redemption in cash at 115% of face value upon certain defaults The Notes mature in two years from date of issuance. The Notes and accrued interest are payable in full at maturity. All amounts due under the Notes may be converted at any time, in part or in whole, at the written election of the holder thereof, into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. The Notes are secured by a first priority perfected interest in all the assets of the Company. At maturity, interest on the 2008 Notes will represent an additional 713,120 shares. Each $100,000 principal amount of Notes is convertible, at the option of the holders, into 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Holders of each $100,000 principal amount of 2008 Notes received two five-year warrants, one with an exercise price of $0.30 per share to purchase 7,692 shares of Common Stock (the “$.30 Warrants”) and the other with an exercise price of $1.00 to purchase 24,615 shares of Common Stock (the “$1.00 Warrants” and collectively with the $.30 Warrants, the “2008 Warrants”) . In connection with the issuance of the 2008 Notes, the Company entered into registration rights agreements and has agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants. . In addition to a cash commission, the placement agent received a five-year warrant to purchase 66,667 shares of Common Stock for each 2008 Unit sold, with an exercise price of $.30 per share. The placement agent’s warrants carry registration rights that are the same as those afforded to investors in the private placement. The description of the terms of sale of the securities described above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underlying documents filed as exhibits to our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on June 24 and September 2, 2008. In January 26, 2009 the Company agreed issue to certain note holders who had purchased on various dates in 2008, 2008 Notes and 2008 Warrants of the Company, as described above, new warrants to purchase, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, that number of shares of our Common Stock, to which a Note Holder would be entitled upon full conversion of a note after a reverse split of the Common Stock with a ratio of one for thirty. We refer to these warrants as the New Warrants. Effective February 6, 2009 the Company affected a 1 for 30 stock split. We refer to this split as the “Reverse Split.” After the effective date of the Reverse Split, for each $100,000 in principal amount of the Notes purchased in 2008, note holders received a New Warrant exercisable for 20,833 shares of our common stock and 936,860 shares in the aggregate for all such New Warrants at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The description of the terms of sale of the securities described above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underlying documents filed as an exhibit to this registration statement. The 2008 Note Units and the 2009 Notes Units were sold to “accredited investors” within the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), in reliance upon the private placement exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placement were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act. We based this determination on the non-public manner in which we offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such person understood such securities may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption therefrom. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into registration rights agreements and has agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Notes and the Warrants. In May 2007, the Company conducted an offering of the Company’s common stock. The stock was sold for $100,000 per unit. Each unit consisted of 3,333 shares of common stock and 833 warrants. The warrants are exercisable at $36.00 per share and expire in five (5) years after purchase of the above-described unit. The Company sold and issued 29,333 shares and received proceeds of $880,000 under the offering. The Company has received a stock subscription for 5,000 shares of its common stock and 1,250 warrants under the offering. On November 19, 2007, the Company settled a dispute with Basic Investors, Inc. (“Basic Investors”). The Company agreed to issue Basic Investors, 12,500 three year warrants at an exercise price of $21.00 per share. The parties exchanged mutual releases. During 2007, 33,805 stock warrants and options were exercised. The Company received total proceeds of $872,290. The 2007 warrants exercised are net of 29,333 shares rescinded by the Board of Directors on April 30, 2007. The Company determined that all of the securities sold and issued in the private placements were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) pursuant Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D Promulgated under the Act. The Company based this determination on the non-public manner in which it offered the securities and on the representations of the persons purchasing such securities, which included, in pertinent part, that such persons were “accredited investors” within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Act, and that such persons were acquiring such securities for investment purposes for their own respective accounts and not as nominees or agents, and not with a view to resale or distribution, and that each such persons understood such securities may not be sold to or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Act or an applicable exemption there from.
