Initial public offering prospectus Specialty Contractors, Inc. Minimum of 90,000 shares of common stock, and a Maximum of 750,000 shares of common stock $0.75 per share We are making a best efforts offering to sell common stock in our company. The common stock will be sold by our sole officer and director, Charles Bartlett after the effective date of this registration statement. The offering price was determined arbitrarily and we will raise a minimum of $67,500 and a maximum of $562,500. The money we raise in this offering before the minimum amount, $67,500, is sold will be held uncashed, in a company safe, where the funds will be held for the benefit of those subscribing for our shares, until the minimum amount is raised at which time we will deposit them in our bank account and retain the transfer agent who will then issue the shares. The offering will end on September 28, 2010 and if the minimum subscription is not raised by the end of the offering period, all funds will be refunded promptly to those who subscribed for our shares, without interest. There is no minimum purchase requirement for subscribers. After the offering, our sole officer and director, Charles Bartlett will continue to own sufficient shares to control the company.

We intend to work with a market maker who would then apply to have our securities quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin Board or on an exchange as soon as practicable after our offering. We will close our offering on September 28, 2010. However, it is possible that we do not get trading on the over-the-counter bulletin Board, and if we do get quoted on the bulletin board, we may not satisfy the listing requirements for an exchange, which are greater than that of the bulletin board. ____________________________ This investment involves a high degree of risk.

This Prospectus is dated __________________________ PROSPECTUS SUMMARY OUR COMPANY We were formed as a corporation on November 18, 2009 in Nevada to perform specialty contracting services, specifically concentrating on outside construction and design relating to custom stone, brick, and wood structures such as outdoor kitchens, grills, retaining walls, and garden structures. In addition, the Company supplies outdoor appliances through various appliance manufacturers. THE OFFERING Our officers and directors will be selling the offering. Minimum Midpoint Maximum Common shares offered 90,000 333,333 750,000 Common shares outstanding before this offering 6,400,000 6,400,000 6,400,000 Total shares outstanding after this offering 6,490,000 6,733,333 7,150,000 Officers, directors and their affiliates will not be able to purchase shares in this offering. SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA The following table sets forth certain of our summary financial information. This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Balance Sheet AUDITED Dec 31, 2009 Working Capital $ 35,482 Total Assets $ 49,925 Total Liabilities $ 18,950 Stockholder’s Equity $ 30,975 Statement of Operations AUDITED Dec 31, 2009 Revenue $ 66,219 Cost of sales $ 54,440 General and administrative $ 26,771 Other income (expense) $ (33 ) Net loss $ (15,025 ) Loss per share: Basic & diluted $ (0.00 ) No. Shares outstanding 6,344,444 2 RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this prospectus before making an investment decision. We have identified all material risks known to, and anticipated by, us as of the filing of this registration statement. We have a limited operating history, with cumulative losses since inception, which, if losses continue, could cause us to run out of money and close our business. We have an accumulated deficit from operations. There is not sufficient gross revenue and profit to finance our planned growth and, without additional financing as outlined in this prospectus, we could continue to experience losses in the future. Our accumulated deficit through December 31, 2009 was $15,025. We may incur significant expenses in promoting our business, and as a result, will need to generate significant revenues over and above our current revenue to achieve consistent profitability. If we are unable to achieve that profitability, your investment in our common stock may decline or become worthless. We rely on our sole officer for decisions and he may make decisions that are not in the best interest of all stockholders. We rely on our sole officer, Charles Bartlett, to direct the affairs of the company and rely upon him to competently operate the business. We do not have key man insurance on him and have no employment agreements with him. Should something happen to him, this reliance on one person could have a material detrimental impact on our business and could cause the business to lose its place in the market, or even fail. Such events could cause the value of our stock to decline or become worthless. Our sole officer will retain control over our business after the offering and may make decisions that are not in the best interest of all stockholders. Upon completion of this offering, our officer, Charles Bartlett, will, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 93.75% (or 83.92% if maximum is sold) of the outstanding common stock. As a result, our two officers will have the ability to control all the matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all of our assets. They will also control our management and affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to take control of us, even if the transaction would be beneficial to other stockholders. This in turn could cause the value of our stock to decline or become worthless. The nature of our business is dependent on a number of factors Our quarterly and annual sales could vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: a significant downturn in the construction and remodeling industry, fluctuating customer demand, delay or timing of raw materials, variations in selling product mix and price competition. The failure of achieving quarterly or annual revenue and profits expectations would likely adversely affect the price of our common stock. 3 Although we believe the funds we raise in this offering will allow us to generate sufficient funds from operations, if that is not the case, we may have to raise additional capital which may not be available or may be too costly, which, if we cannot obtain, could cause us to have to cease our operations. We expect that the funds we raise in this offering will take us to the point of a positive cash flow. However, if that does not turn out to be the case, our capital requirements could be more than our operating income. As of December 31, 2009, our cash balance was $0. We do not have sufficient cash to indefinitely sustain operating losses, but believe we can generate positive cash flow within twelve months from the funds raised in this offering. Our potential profitability depends on our ability to generate and sustain substantially higher net sales with reasonable expense levels. We may not operate on a profitable basis or that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to pay our operating costs. We anticipate that the funds raised in this offering will be sufficient to fund our planned growth for the year after we close on th e offering assuming we raise the minimum amount in this offering. Thereafter, if we do not achieve profitability, we will need to raise additional capital to finance our operations. We have no current or proposed financing plans or arrangements other than this offering. We could seek additional financing through debt or equity offerings. Additional financing may not be available to us, or, if available, may be on terms unacceptable or unfavorable to us. If we need and cannot raise additional funds, further development of our business, upgrades in our technology, additions to our product lines may be delayed or postponed indefinitely; if this happens, the value of your investment could decline or become worthless. No public market for our common stock currently exists and an active trading market may never materialize, and an investor may not be able to sell their stock. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. We plan work with a market maker who would then apply to have our securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. In order to be quoted on the OTCBB, we must be sponsored by a participating market maker who would make the application on our behalf; at this time, we are not aware of a market maker who intends to sponsor our securities and make a market in our stock. Assuming we become quoted, an active trading market still may not develop and if an active market does not develop, the market value could decline to a value below the offering price in this prospectus. Additionally, if the market is not active or illiquid, investors may not be able to sell their securities. If a public trading market for our common stock materializes, we will be classified as a ‘penny stock’ which has additional requirements in trading the stock, which could cause you not to be able to sell your stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission treats stocks of certain companies as a ‘penny stock’. We are not aware of a market maker who intends to make a market in our stock, but should we be cleared to trade, we would be classified as a ‘penny stock’ which makes it harder to trade even if it is traded on an electronic exchange like the over-the-counter bulletin board. These requirements include (i) broker-dealers who sell to customers must have the buyer fill out a questionnaire, and (ii) broker-dealers may decide upon the information given by a prospective buyer whether or not the broker-dealer determines the stock is suitable for their financial position. These rules may adversely affect the ability of both the selling broker-dealer and the buying broker-dealer to trade your securities as well as the p urchasers of your securities to sell them in the secondary market. These requirements may cause potential buyers to be eliminated and the market for the common stock you purchase in this offering could have no effective market to sell into, thereby causing your investment to be worthless. 4 Investing in a penny stock has inherent risks, affecting both brokers, buyers and sellers, which could cause the marketability of your stock to be lesser than if there were not those requirements. When a seller of a ‘penny stock’ desires to sell, they must execute that trade through a broker. Many brokers do not deal in penny stocks, so a seller’s ability to market/sell their stock is reduced because of the number of brokers who engage in trading such stocks. Additionally, if a broker does engage in trading penny stocks, and the broker has a client who wishes to buy the stock, they must have the client fill out a number of pages of paperwork before they can execute the trade. These requirements cause a burden to some who may decide not to buy because of the additional paperwork. Thus, the marketability of your stock is less as a penny stock than as a stock listed on an exchange. This could cause your investment to be worth less liquid and investors may not be able to market their shares effectively. Shareholders purchasing shares in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution, causing their investment to immedi a tely be worth less than their purchase price. If you purchase common stock in this offering, you will experience an immediate and substantial dilution in the projected book value of the common stock from the price you pay in this initial offering. This means that if you buy stock in this offering at $0.75 per share, you will pay substantially more than our current shareholders. The following represents your dilution: (a) if the minimum of 90,000 shares are sold, an immediate decrease in book value to our new shareholders from $0.75 to $0.01 per share and an immediate dilution to the new shareholders of $0.74 per common share; (b) if the midpoint of 333,333 shares are sold, an immediate decrease in book value to our new shareholders from $0.75 to $0.04 per share and an immediate dilution to the new shareholders of $0.71 per common share. and (c) if the maximum of 750,000 share s are sold, an immediate decrease in book value to our new shareholders from $0.75 to $0.08 per share and an immediate dilution to the new shareholders of $0.67 per common share. Investors are not able to cancel their subscription agreements they sign, therefore losing any chance to change their minds. Once the Company receives an investors subscription, they will not be able to cancel their subscription. The investor will therefore lose any right or opportunity to change their mind after receipt by the Company. Our offering price of $0.75 was determined arbitrarily by our President. Your investment may not be worth as much as the offering price because of the method of its determination . The President arbitrarily determined the price for the offering of $0.75 per share. As the offering price is not based on a specific calculation or metric the price has inherent risks and therefore your investment could be worth less than the offering price. 5 Our audit report from our auditors discloses in Note 9 to the financial statements that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, which, if true, could result in your investment becoming worth significantly less than the offering price, or possibly even causing it to become worthless. Note 9 to our financial statements discuss a substantial doubt that we can continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we will have to close our doors or recapitalize, both of which would cause a loss of value, either through dilution or becoming worthless. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are not historical facts but rather are based our current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. Words such as "anticipates", "expects", "intends", "plans", "believes", "seeks" and "estimates", and variations of these words and similar expressions, are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in the forward looking statements. In addition, the forward looking events discussed in this prospectus might not occur. The se risks and uncertainties include, among others, those described in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this prospectus. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which reflect our management's view only as of the date of this prospectus. DILUTION If you purchase common stock in this offering, you will experience an immediate and substantial dilution in the projected book value of the common stock from the price you pay in this initial offering. The book value of our common stock as of December 31, 2009 was $30,975 or $0.00 per share. Projected book value per share is equal to our total assets, less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. After giving effect to the sale of common stock offered by us in this offering, and the receipt and application of the estimated net proceeds (at an initial public offering price of $0.75 per share, after deducting estimated offering expenses), our projected book value as of December 31, 2009 would be: $74,252 or $0.01 per share, if the minimum is sold, $299,252 or $0.04 per share, if the midpoint amount is sold, and $552,252 or $0.08 per share, if the maximum is sold. This means that if you buy stock in this offering at $0.75 per share, you will pay substantially more than our current shareholders. The following represents your dilution: · if the minimum of 90,000 shares are sold, an immediate decrease in book value to our new shareholders from $0.75 to $0.01 per share and an immediate dilution to the new shareholders of $0.74 per common share. 6 · if the midpoint amount of 333,333 shares are sold, an immediate decrease in book value to our new shareholders from $0.75 to $0.04 per share and an immediate dilution to the new shareholders of $0.71 per common share. · if the maximum of 750,000 shares are sold, an immediate decrease in book value to our new shareholders from $0.75 to $0.08 per share and an immediate dilution to the new shareholders of $0.67 per common share. The following table illustrates this per share dilution: Minimum Midpoint Maximum Assumed initial public offering price $ 0.75 $ 0.75 $ 0.75 Book value as of December 31, 2009 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 Projected book value after this offering $ 0.01 $ 0.00 $ 0.08 Increase attributable to new stockholders: $ 0.01 $ 0.04 $ 0.08 Projected book value as of December 31, 2009 after this offering $ 0.01 $ 0.04 $ 0.08 Decrease to new stockholders $ (0.74 ) $ (0.71 ) $ (0.67 ) Percentage dilution to new stockholders 99 % 95 % 89 % The following table summarizes and shows on a projected basis as of December 31, 2009, the differences between the number of shares of common stock purchased, the total consideration paid and the total average price per share paid by the existing stockholders and the new investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering: Minimum offering Number of shares owned Percent of shares owned Amount paid Average price per share Current investors 6,400,000 98.61 $ 46,000 $ 0.01 New investors 90,000 1.39 $ 67,500 $ 0.75 Total 6,490,000 100.00 $ 113,500 Midpoint offering Current investors 6,400,000 95.05 $ 46,000 $ 0.01 New investors 333,333 4.95 $ 250,000 $ 0.75 Total 6,733,333 100.00 $ 296,000 Maximum offering Current investors 6,400,000 89.51 $ 46,000 $ 0.01 New investors 750,000 10.49 $ 562,500 $ 0.75 Total 7,150,000 100.00 $ 608,500 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The common stock is being sold on our behalf by our sole officer and director, who will receive no commission on such sales.

The money we raise in this offering before the minimum amount is sold will be held uncashed, in a company safe where the funds will be held for the benefit of those subscribing for our shares, until the minimum amount is raised at which time we will deposit the funds in our bank account and retain the transfer agent who will then issue the shares. We do not have an escrow agreement or any other agreement regarding the custody of the funds we raise. The offering will end on September 28, 2010 and if the minimum subscription is not raised by the end of the offering period, all funds will be refunded by the end of the next business day to those who subscribed for our shares, without interest. The offering will close on September 28, 2010, if not terminated sooner.

In addition, if the minimum subscription is not raised by September 28, 2010, the subscription agreement will be terminated and any funds received will be promptly returned to the investors.

The following table sets forth how we anticipate using the proceeds from selling common stock in this offering, reflecting the minimum and maximum subscription amounts: $67,500 Minimum $250,000 Mid-Level $562,500 Maximum Legal, Accounting & Printing Expenses $ 6,500 $ 12,000 $ 23,000 Other Offering Expenses 10,269 10,769 10,769 Net Proceeds to Company 50,731 227,231 528,731 TOTAL $ 67,500 $ 250,000 $ 562,500 The following describe each of the expense categories: · Legal, accounting and printing expense is the estimated costs associated with this offering. As more shares are sold, we anticipate legal fees to increase due to the likelihood of investors being from other states which could result in state blue sky securities filings. Although our legal fees are not contingent on the number of shares sold, it is likely that the legal fees will increase as our attorney will charge us for these filings. Also, as more shares are sold, our printing expenses will increase. · Other offering expenses include SEC registration fee, blue sky fees and miscellaneous expenses with regards to this offering. The blue sky fees are fees charged by the States to pay for registering in various states, which vary by state, as well as additional legal fees. The following table sets forth how we anticipate using the net proceeds to the company: $67,500 Minimum $250,000 Mid-Level $562,500 Maximum Marketing/Promotion $ 5,000 $ 15,500 $ 65,000 Equipment purchases 12,000 75,000 100,000 Software/website development 9,000 35,000 75,000 Salaries, commissions 15,000 75,000 165,000 General corporate overhead (1) 9,731 27,231 123,731 Proceeds to company $ 50,731 $ 227,231 $ 528,731 (1) General Corporate overhead includes office rent, office supplies, utilities, taxes, and any other expense incurred in the normal course of business. We do not plan to use any of the proceeds to pay off debts owed by the Company. Additionally, all amounts allocated for salaries/commissions will be for new hires and not for officers or directors of the company. For a more detailed discussion of the use of proceeds, reader is referred to the Management’s Discussion and Plan of Operation section of this offering. 9 The proceeds from this offering will enable the Company to further develop its web-based business model which in turn provides access to markets that are currently unreachable. We plan to expand our web-based business through integrated marketing campaigns which include: advertising, buying targeted lists and utilizing banner advertising on partner web-sites. Advertising: We plan to utilize both traditional advertising mediums (newspaper, industry magazines, etc.) and the internet (web-site banners). DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Specialty Contractors, Inc. ( the “Company” or “Specialty”) was formed in 2009 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company performs specialty contracting services, specifically concentrating on outside construction and design relating to stone, brick, and wood structures such as outdoor kitchens, grills, retaining walls, and garden structures. In general, they are referred to as specialty stone structures or creations. In addition, the Company supplies outdoor appliances through various appliance manufacturers, geared particularly to its stone creations such as indoor or outdoor kitchens. We perform specialty contracting work that includes mailboxes, outdoor kitchens, outdoor grills, retaining walls, garden structures, and home remodeling. We use all types of materials such as stone, brick, and wood. Our designs can be custom tailored to the client’s preferences or selected from an inventory of pre-fabricated designs. As part of this offering, we will further develop our design inventory and develop a website highlighting our product offerings, although we have completed our website at this time. We plan to market the smaller items for order through our website such as prefabricated mailboxes and outdoor grills that have the look of stone, but are light enough to ship because of the materials we use. At present, our market territory is primarily local, soliciting business through word-of-mouth and advertising in the phone book and through print advertising. We continue to develop our local market. The Company plans to develop a web site that will allow it to present the many designs and product offerings available nationwide. A portion of the proceeds of this offering will be used for web site design and development. The company believes a web site featuring Company products will provide access to a national marketplace. We are a development stage company as defined by the ASC topic 810-10-20 and as such do not have a developed distribution process. As stated previously, our marketing efforts have been primarily local through print advertising and word-of-mouth. This has provided for local contract work which doesn’t require a sophisticated delivery system. As we build out our web site, we will simultaneously develop a more sophisticated distribution process through direct shipment, design plan templates, and technical assistance. However, the money raised in this offering will be used to develop a product based web site as well as purchase industry best-in-class internet software to facilitate the build-out of our internet marketing, ordering, and delivery. As previously mentioned, we are currently local in scope. However, through the leveraging of technology, specifically the internet and electronic communications, the main thrust of our business platform is to expand nationally through strategic alliances with other locally based contractors. The local contractors will perform the build out work following specific design and build blueprints unique to the company. Oversight of the work will be performed by the local contractor foreman with digital imagery of the work site electronically communicated to us for review and comment. Our business model will encompass the following primary construction platforms: 10 Outdoor Kitchen Design and Build: Outdoor kitchens have become very popular, often including items that previously were considered in-home appliances. Large, stone or brick patio areas include accessories such as large open pit or traditional oven assemblies, outdoor refrigerators, cabinets, and seating areas. Design of these entertainment areas are essential for enhancing functionality and enjoyment of gatherings. Aesthetics are of key importance. As a package, we are able to design a layout based on customer need, preference, and purpose and then contract to have the plans built to order. Outdoor Grill Patios and Accessories: As with the outdoor kitchen concept, grills are becoming focus points for outdoor activities. Our ability to design and build around a grill based activity pattern is one of our primary strengths. To complement our design and build concept, we also assist the client in purchasing the grill of their choice from a grill manufacturer. Retaining Walls: Retaining walls are built to restrain or to aesthetically enhance a garden. As such, walls can be comprised of brick, stone, masonry, or wood. Retaining walls are integral to a gardens overall ambiance. We offer not only electronic imagery in the design phase, but also work with the client on personal preference and desired aesthetics. Garden Structures: Garden structures include gazebos, decks, patios, arbors, and trellises. We have numerous styles which can be further custom modified to suit any client’s preference. These are sold in kits and can be shipped anywhere in the continental United States and Canada. Typically, we have a backlog of twenty to thirty thousand dollars in orders for our products and services. MARKETING ACTIVITIES Marketing activities have been restricted by cash flow and as such have been limited to word of mouth and print advertising.

INDUSTRY AND COMPETITORS The specialty construction industry is served by numerous local and regional independent contractors. Historically, customers primarily contracted directly with local design and build contractors. With the broad reach of the internet, contractors have been able to offer designs and purchasing power to most any market in the United States. These contractors can then sell a design format along with specific outdoor equipment and then contract with a locally based contractor for the installation phase. Numerous outdoor kitchen design and installation companies as well as home remodelers specializing in outdoor and indoor remodeling projects have leveraged the internet to display, market and push their products and specialties into the general public. As such, the marketplace is fragmented and marketing by word of mouth, unique designs, and state of the art equipment are ever increasingly important to a discerning consumer public. It is these aspects, namely quality, conversion of customer preferences and ideas into practical usage packages, and expert installation that gives Specialty a competitive advantage. Because we do not have field sales people knocking on high-volume prospects’ doors, we don’t really compete on a head to head basis. Our competitive position is based on servicing the customer’s needs: · Design and product offering · High quality · Speedy delivery and installation Prospects find us from referrals or through print advertising and our method of competition is: · Provide price quotes and design discussion upon visiting and inspection of the property · Share design and equipment ideas/examples in person when visiting · Few competitors have as complete an inventory of designs and pre-fabricated kits as we do, giving us a competitive edge Due to our growth we have not experienced any significant seasonality. There is some seasonality in the construction market (usually slower during the winter and rainy months) as most of our product offerings are for outdoors improvements and beautification. SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL Our raw materials are purchased from local market wholesalers of stone, brick, and lumber. Equipment installations are considered finished goods products and are ordered on a drop ship basis to the job site. COSTS AND EFFECTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS We are not aware of nor do we anticipate any environmental laws with which we will have to comply. NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES The Company presently has one employee, Charles Bartlett, President and CEO. All other workers are subcontractors hired on a job by job basis. 12 MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS The Company has not made nor is it subject to a merger or acquisition. FURUTRE INDEBTEDNESS & FINANCING The Company does not anticipate having cash flow or liquidity problems within the next 12 months. The Company is not in violation of any note, loan, lease or other indebtedness or financing arrangement requiring the Company to make payments. We believe that by raising the minimum amount of funds in this offering we will have sufficient funds to cash flow our growth plans for a minimum of twelve months. PUBLIC INFORMATION We do not have any information that has been made public or that will require an investment or material asset of ours. Additional information: We have made no public announcements to date and have no additional or new products or services. In addition, we don’t intend to spend funds in the field of research and development; no money has been spent or is contemplated to be spent on customer sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, services or techniques; and we don’t anticipate spending funds on improvement of existing products, services or techniques. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS As of December 31, 2009 our cash balance was $0. Revenues for the period from November 18, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009 were $66,219. Cost of sales for the period from November 18, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009 were $54,440. Operating expenses for the period from November 18, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009 were $26,771. We had interest expense for the same period of $33. Our net loss was $15,025 for the period from November 18, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009. The plan of operations for the 12 months following the commencement of this offering will include our plan for growth. The Company plans to implement this growth plan by purchasing some equipment and developing our website to reach markets outside of our immediate geographical area. If the maximum amount is raised, we expect to spend $100,000 on equipment and $140,000 on marketing and developing our website. Augmenting our growth will be the addition of salesmen. The company has budgeted $165,000 for salaries and commissions if the maximum amount is raised in this offering. Marketing and advertising costs will be determined by the amount raised in the initial offering. If the maximum amount of $562,500 is raised, these costs are projected to total $65,000 in the first 12 months of operation. If the minimum amount is raised in this offering, in the first 12 months of operation, $5,000 is budgeted to be spent on advertising. 13 We focus on evaluating our financial condition and operating performance based on gross margin and cash flow. Gross margin management includes the management of our cost of sales, more specifically, labor and materials. Regarding material trends (raw materials), uncertainties or events that may reasonably occur affecting financial conditions or revenues include procurement and quality of product. Cash flows used in operations for the period from November 18, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009 was $34,361 due to the increase in accounts receivable of $42,732. We expect continued growth in 2010, due to our continuing sales backlog, which at this time is estimated to be $40,000. We expect earnings to grow as the costs associated with starting the business have been absorbed and as inefficiencies with training crews are now no longer an issue. We are not aware of any economic or industry factors relevant to company. We see material opportunities, challenges, and risks in the short and long term. These include the combination of film thickness, film color and adhesive coating is an additional product line, appealing to a broader base of prospects, as well as increased sales opportunities to existing customers. Specialty Contractors evaluates potential demand for additional film types and adds them to inventory when there is sufficient demand. While this boosts sales revenue and is profitable over a period of time, this growth in product inventory is a challenge to both cash flow and to warehouse space. Specialty Contractors is actively prospecting for a larger warehouse and operating facility, as well as additional operating capital. We will not use the proceeds of the offering to pay down debt. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that currently have or would have a future effect on our financial condition. Additionally, there are no significant critical accounting estimates or assumptions. Generating Sufficient Revenue: Since inception, we have generated revenue through advertising, referrals, and word of mouth. Over the next twelve months we plan to develop our web-based marketing and additional targeted print advertising. The web-based advertising will expose the Company to a different set of demographics and geographies. Financing Needs: Our cash flows since inception have not been adequate to support on-going operations. As noted above, the Company's financing needs for the next twelve months can and will be met even if the minimum offering amount is raised. We believe that by raising the minimum amount of funds in this offering we will have sufficient funds to cash flow our growth plans for a minimum of twelve months. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY Our corporate facilities are in a 1,500 s.f. facility of which approximately half is warehouse space. It is leased on a month to month basis for $500 per month which we start paying rent in April 2010.

The provision does not affect a director’s responsibilities under any other laws, such as the federal securities laws or state or federal environmental laws. 17 The position of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933: Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the small business issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the small business issuer has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

Rockwall, Texas We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Specialty Contractors, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statement of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the period from November 18, 2009 (inception) through December 31, 2009. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Specialty Contractors, Inc. as of December 31, 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from November 18, 2009 (inception) through December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's losses from operations, and its need for additional financing in order to fund its projected loss in 2010 raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The 2009 financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ LBB & Associates Ltd., LLP LBB & Associates Ltd., LLP Houston, Texas April 6, 2010 F-1 SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS, INC.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 NOTE 1 – NATURE OF ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Activities, History and Organization: SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS, Inc. (“SPECIALTY”, the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 18, 2009. The Company operates as a contractor and performing specialty construction projects. The Company operates on a calendar year-end. The Company operates in only one business segment. Basis of Accounting and Consolidation: The Company prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting. It has one subsidiary, Texas Deco Pierre, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Investments in subsidiaries are reported using the equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations. Significant Accounting Policies: The Company’s management selects accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and adopts methods for their application. The application of accounting principles requires the estimating, matching and timing of revenue and expense. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company's system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented. FASB Accounting Standards Codification: In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance concerning the organization of authoritative guidance under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). This new guidance created the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Codification”). The Codification has become the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification became effective for the Company in its quarter ended December 31, 2009. As the Codification is not intended to change or alter existing U.S. GAAP, it did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidat ed financial statements. On its effective date, the Codification superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other nongrandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification will become nonauthoritative. F-6 SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated at cost which approximates market value, which in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: In accordance with the reporting requirements of ASC 820, “ Fair Value Measurements ” (formerly SFAS No. 157, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments”), the Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under this statement and includes this additional information in the notes to the financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s marketable securities and capital leases approximate fair value due to the stated interest rates approximating market rates. Inventory: Our proposed inventory policy is as follows. Inventory is comprised of goods purchased for resale; therefore the Company has no raw materials or work in process. The Company uses the specific identification and FIFO (“First In, First Out”) methods for inventory tracking and valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable are carried at their face amount, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates accounts receivable and establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances and credit conditions, based on a history of write offs and collections. The Company’s policy is generally not to charge interest on trade receivables after the invoice becomes past due. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms. Write-offs are recorded at a time when a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized; minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are charged to current operations. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over five to seven years. Revenue Recognition: The Company records revenues from its fixed-price, long-term contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. Revenues are recorded based on construction costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total cost at completion. The percentage-of-completion, determined by using total costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total costs at completion, reflects the actual physical completion of the project. If the current projected costs on a fixed fee contract exceed projected revenue, the entire amount of the loss is recognized in the period such loss is identified. F-7 SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 Cost of Goods Sold: The types of costs included in Cost of Goods Sold are: ● Direct material costs ● Purchasing, receiving and inspection ● Labor ● Ingoing and outgoing freight ● On site expenses ● Costs of travel and lodging related to out of town jobs Income Taxes: The Company has adopted ASC 740-10 “ Income Taxes ” (formerly SFAS No. 109), which requires the use of the liability method in the computation of income tax expense and the current and deferred income taxes payable. Earnings per Share: Earnings per share (basic) is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period covered. As the Company has no potentially dilutive securities, fully diluted earnings per share is equal to earnings per share (basic). Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In 2009, the FASB issued the following guidance: SFAS No. 166: "Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 ", which will be integrated into the ASC upon the effective date, which is for the first annual or quarterly period after November 15, 2009. SFAS No. 167: "Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets", which will be integrated into the ASC upon the effective date, which is for the first annual or quarterly period after November 15, 2009. FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1: “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” , which was codified into ASC 825. FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2: “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments” , which was codified into ASC 320-10-65-4. FSP No. FAS 157-4: “ Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly” , which was codified into ASC 820-10-65-4. Management has reviewed these new standards and believes that they will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Company. F-8 SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation expense is recorded in accordance with ASC 505-50-05, Share-Based Payment , for stock and stock options awarded in return for services rendered. The expense is measured at the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures that it expects will occur and records expense based upon the number of awards expected to vest. NOTE 2 – FIXED ASSETS Fixed Assets at December 31, 2009 are as follows: 2009 Property & Equipment $ 7,339 Less: Accumulated Depreciation (146 ) Total Fixed Assets $ 7,193 The Company’s fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the asset’s useful lives, ranging from five to seven years. Depreciation expense was $146 for the period ended December 31, 2009. NOTE 3 – LINE OF CREDIT The Company has a line of credit (“LOC”) with GCG Ventures. The LOC has a $50,000 credit limit, and bears an interest rate of 5% per annum, due May 31, 2012.

NOTE 7 – INCOME TAXES Specialty Contractors, Inc. follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of (a) temporary difference between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes, and (b) net operating loss carryforwards. No net provision for refundable Federal income tax has been made in the accompanying statement of loss because no recoverable taxes were paid previously. Similarly, no deferred tax asset attributable to the net operating loss carryforward has been recognized, as it is not deemed likely to be realized. The provision for refundable Federal income tax consists of the following: December 31, 2009 Refundable Federal income tax attributable to: Current operations $ 3,000 Less, change in valuation allowance (3,000 ) Net refundable amount $ - The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34% of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows: December 31, 2009 Deferred tax asset attributable to: Net operating loss carryover $ 5,100 Effect of non-deductibility of stock compensation (2,100 ) Change in valuation allowance (3,000 ) Net deferred tax asset $ - At December 31, 2009, Specialty Contractors, Inc. had an unused net operating loss carryover approximating $5,000 that is available to offset future taxable income and expires beginning in 2029. F-10 SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2009 NOTE 8 – MAJOR CUSTOMERS The Company performed work for the following customers that accounted for more than 10% of its revenues: $ Revenue Percent of revenue Customer A $22,419 34% Cistp,er B $43,800 66% NOTE 9 – FINANCIAL CONDITION AND GOING CONCERN The Company has an accumulated deficit through December 31, 2009 totaling $15,025 and had working capital of $35,482. Because of this accumulated deficit, the Company will require additional working capital to develop its business operations. The Company has experienced no loan defaults, labor stoppages, legal proceedings or any other operating interruption in 2009. Therefore, these items will not factor into whether the business continues as a going concern, and accordingly, management has not made any plans to dispose of assets or factor receivables to assist in generating working capital. The Company intends to raise additional working capital either through private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing, or additional loans from Management if there is need for liquidity. Management may also consider reducing administrative costs. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support the Company’s working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not generated from operations, financing is not available, or the Management cannot loan sufficient funds, the Company may not be able to continue its operations. Management believes that the efforts it has made to promote its operation will continue for the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers Our certificate of incorporation provides that the liability of our officers and directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under Nevada Revised Statutes, which includes elimination of liability for monetary damages for defense of civil or criminal actions. The provision does not affect a director’s responsibilities under any other laws, such as the federal securities laws or state or federal environmental laws. Article Thirteen of our Articles of Incorporation states: No director shall be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit, or (iv) for any act or omission occurring prior to their resignation as a director. Item 2. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution All expenses, including all allocated general administrative and overhead expenses, related to the offering or the organization of the Company will be borne by the Company.

Although our legal fees are not contingent on the number of shares sold, it is likely that the legal fees will increase as our attorney will charge us for these filings. Also, as more shares are sold, our printing expenses will increase. II-1 Item 3. Undertakings 1(a) Rule 415 Offering . If the small business issuer is registering securities under Rule 415 of the Securities Act (230.415 of this chapter), that the small business issuer will: (1) File, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement to: (i) Include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; and (ii) Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registrati on Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) Include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution. (2) For determining liability under the Securities Act, treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering. (3) File a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering. (4) For determining liability of the undersigned small business issuer under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned small business issuer undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned small business issuer pursuant to his registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned small business issuer will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned small business issuer relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (230.424 of this chapter); (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned small business issuer or used or referred to by the undersigned small business issuer; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned small business issuer or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned small business issuer; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned small business issuer to the purchaser.
