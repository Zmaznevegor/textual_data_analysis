Under these laws, there exists a presumption of control when an acquiring party acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or of a company that controls an insurance company. Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of voting control over our common stock would need prior approval of the state insurance regulators of these states, or a determination from such regulators that control has not been acquired.

It does not contain all of the information that you need to consider in making an investment decision. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, including the information under Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements and our historical consolidated and pro forma financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our Company We are the second largest writer of property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, and the tenth largest writer of all property and casualty insurance in the United States, in each case based on 2008 net written premiums. We offer a balanced mix of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-size businesses and individuals throughout the United States. We also provide contract and commercial surety bonds on a national basis. We combine a national infrastructure with a regional focus, which enables us to develop and maintain strong relationships with independent agencies and policyholders. In 2009, we produced $10.1 billion of net written premiums through approximately 13,000 independent agencies. These premiums include $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion generated by our Commercial and Personal segments, respectively. We are currently part of Liberty Mutual Group, the fifth largest property and casualty insurer in the United States, based on 2008 direct written premiums. We have grown significantly both organically and through acquisitions, including the acquisition of Safeco in September 2008 and Ohio Casualty in August 2007. Safeco wrote $5.6 billion of net written premiums in 2007, and Ohio Casualty wrote $1.4 billion of net written premiums in 2006. After giving pro forma effect to this offering and the transactions for which we have made pro forma adjustments as described under Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements, we would have had $ billion of total assets and $ billion of stockholders equity as of December 31, 2009 and $ billion of revenues and $ million of net income in 2009. Segments We provide property and casualty insurance products through our three operating segments: Commercial, Personal and Surety. Each operating segment is led by an experienced management team with a high degree of autonomy to make decisions on key operating matters within established parameters. We believe this decentralized operating philosophy combined with our regional focus allows us to more effectively reach and serve our agents and policyholders. Our national infrastructure creates economies of scale and provides our regional operations with centralized functions, including pricing and underwriting tools, product development and claims management. We believe our regional focus results in better agency and policyholder relationships and, when combined with our national infrastructure, produces superior product design, service, underwriting and claims processing. The managers of our operating segments are eligible to receive incentive-based compensation based on the operating performance of their segment and the overall performance of our company, thereby encouraging cooperation across the entire organization. The following is a description of our three operating segments:  Commercial: We are the fifth largest writer of commercial lines property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, based on 2008 net written premiums. We offer insurance coverage for commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation, general liability and other commercial risks to small and mid-size businesses (generally fewer than 150 employees and annual insurance premiums under $150,000). Approximately 95% of our commercial lines accounts have annual premiums of less than $15,000. We have minimal exposure to the highly competitive commercial insurance market segment consisting of accounts with annual insurance premiums in excess of $150,000. Our Commercial segment markets products through eight regional operating units, each with a distinct brand, except for excess casualty products, which are marketed 1 Table of Contents under a national brand. Our Commercial segment generated $4.6 billion, or 45% of our total net written premiums, in 2009.  Personal: We are the third largest writer of personal lines property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, based on 2008 net written premiums. Using the Safeco Insurance brand, we offer insurance coverage to individuals on a national basis for private passenger automobile, homeowners and other personal property and liability risks. We market our personal lines products through eight regions covering geographic territories that are identical to those of our Commercial segment. Our Personal segment generated $4.7 billion, or 46% of our total net written premiums, in 2009.  Surety: We are the second largest writer of surety business in the United States, based on 2008 net written premiums. We utilize the Liberty Mutual Surety brand for large national accounts and the Liberty SuretyFirst brand for regional and individual accounts. Our Surety segment generated $707 million, or 7% of our total net written premiums, in 2009. In addition to our three operating segments, we also have a fourth segment, Corporate and Other, which reflects the results of external reinsurance, inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, run-off operations, net realized investment gains (losses), unallocated investment income, and interest and other expenses. Our Corporate and Other segment generated $162 million, or 2%, of our total net written premiums in 2009. We market our products using a co-branding strategy under which each of our operating segment brands is identified as a member of the Liberty Mutual Group. As part of this co-branding strategy, under a trademark license agreement with Liberty Mutual, we have the right to use certain marks containing the words Liberty Mutual and the Statue of Liberty design. We believe this co-branding approach leverages the national awareness of the Liberty Mutual brand, while differentiating our products within our target markets. Distribution Property and casualty insurance companies generally market their products through one of three distribution systems: independent agents and brokers, exclusive agents or direct to the policyholder. Independent insurance agencies accounted for approximately 50% of property and casualty net written premiums in the United States in 2008, according to A.M. Best. We believe there were approximately 37,500 independent insurance agencies in the United States in 2008. We distribute substantially all of our insurance products and services through approximately 13,000 independent agencies. These independent agencies are located in approximately 25,000 offices across all 50 states. We believe that our focus on independent agencies eliminates potential channel conflict and enables us to capture a broad base of profitable policyholder relationships over the long-term. To protect the integrity of our franchise we are selective in appointing our agencies. In selecting new independent agencies to distribute our products, we consider each agencys profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit with our operating and marketing plans. No single agency produced more than approximately 1.5% of our net written premiums in 2009. We seek to develop strong partnerships with independent agencies by being a critical part of their success and profitability. We achieve this by, among other things, providing competitive products to meet the needs of agencies and policyholders, displaying a strong service orientation, delivering technology solutions that enable ease of doing business, utilizing profit sharing arrangements that reward agents for profitable underwriting growth and providing consistency in the marketplace. In turn, agencies endeavor to grow profitably with us by distributing our products to those customers who best meet our underwriting criteria. We have established agency advisory councils to solicit input from our agencies on, among other topics, product design and policyholder issues. At December 31, 2009, we believe we ranked as one of the top three carriers in terms of premiums in approximately 50% of our commercial lines agencies and in approximately 30% of our personal lines agencies. We believe this degree of penetration in an agency enables our company to have the best opportunities to write the highest quality business. Based on an industry study of independent insurance agents, the top three insurers represented by an independent agency accounted for approximately 90% of the total premiums produced by that agency in 2008. 2 Table of Contents Competitive Strengths We believe the following are our key competitive strengths:  Strong Agency Relationships Resulting in High Quality Business: As many of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates have been in business for over 80 years, we have a deep understanding of our agents and policyholders needs. Our local reach through our 128 offices in the United States provides our agents with direct access to our regional executives and enables us to work closely with those agents by providing planning, support and training services. Our franchise has been built over many years through these relationships, particularly with our top performing agents. Given our deep and long-standing agency relationships, we believe we have the opportunity to write the highest quality business and the value of our franchise cannot be easily or quickly replicated.  Localized Knowledge from Multiple Regional Operations with a Highly Efficient National Infrastructure: We are able to combine the high quality service and responsiveness of a regional carrier with the sophisticated underwriting, product development, claims management capability and capital base of a national carrier. This unique combination enables us to develop and maintain deep, long-lasting relationships with independent agencies and policyholders.  Well-Diversified and Balanced Business Mix: Our business is highly diversified and balanced by product, geographic region, agency relationship and customer account. Our Commercial and Personal segments contributed approximately 45% and 46%, respectively, of our 2009 net written premiums. We believe that this diversification enables us to effectively manage through property and casualty pricing cycles and reduces the capital and earnings impact of any single catastrophic event.  Sophisticated Pricing, Underwriting and Risk Management: Our pricing, underwriting and risk management strategy emphasizes profitable growth and optimization of our risk-adjusted returns in each of our operating segments, product lines and product offerings. We use proprietary models in conjunction with rigorous analytical review to make pricing and underwriting decisions and to manage risk exposures across geographies, product lines, product offerings and customer segments. Our objective is to achieve (i) underwriting profitability, (ii) disciplined, opportunistic growth and (iii) attractive risk-adjusted returns.  Superior Financial Strength: Our capitalization and financial strength create a competitive advantage in retaining and attracting new business. After giving pro forma effect to this offering and the transactions for which we have made pro forma adjustments as described under Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2009 we would have had total assets and stockholders equity of $ billion and $ billion, respectively. Furthermore, we believe our reserve position is strong and is bolstered by an indemnification agreement, which we refer to in this prospectus as the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement, between us and Liberty Mutual, which provides us with $500 million of coverage for adverse development in legacy run-off liability exposures. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. We believe our strong balance sheet and the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement will afford us continued future financial flexibility, enabling us to write more desirable business.  Disciplined Acquisition Strategy and Proven Integration Experience: We have proven experience in acquiring and successfully integrating property and casualty businesses, including Safeco and Ohio Casualty. We are a disciplined acquirer and have a demonstrated ability to realize significant transaction synergies and accelerate earnings growth.  Experienced Management Team with a Successful Track Record: We have a talented and experienced management team led by our Chief Executive Officer and President, Gary Gregg, who has 21 years of service in the property and casualty insurance industry. Our senior management team has worked in the property and casualty insurance industry for an average of 27 years and has an extensive track record of profitably underwriting, growing and acquiring commercial and personal lines businesses. 3 Table of Contents Strategies We intend to manage our business by pursuing the following strategies:  Pursue Profitable Growth While Maintaining Pricing and Underwriting Discipline: We expect to grow each of our businesses and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining our underwriting discipline, well-diversified business mix and broad geographic presence. We believe that the key to success across our businesses lies in our disciplined pricing and underwriting and a culture that focuses on management accountability for the profitability of their respective businesses. We historically have been, and will continue to be, a highly disciplined growth organization.  Attract High Quality Independent Agencies and Strengthen Existing Relationships: A critical competitive advantage in the property and casualty insurance industry is a loyal, high quality and well managed distribution network that matches the insurers products and services with the needs of its policyholders. We believe that our strong agency relationships are the key to success across all of our businesses. It is our objective to be one of the top three insurers within the agencies that distribute our products. We intend to continue strengthening our relationships and building our franchise with top performing agents by providing them with planning, support, training and competitive compensation that supports profitable growth. We also intend to grow our business with our agents by increasing cross-selling efforts, providing comprehensive risk management and insurance solutions for the policyholders served by those agents and delivering a broad array of innovative products and services.  Focus on Small and Mid-Size Commercial Segment and Personal Lines Customers with Multi-Faceted Insurance Needs: We seek to leverage our strong independent agency network by targeting small and mid-size commercial accounts and individuals with multi-faceted insurance needs. We believe that many customers prefer to purchase insurance products from trusted independent agents with a presence in their communities. Our unique combination of local expertise and decision-making authority, coupled with the strength of our national platform and strong brands, positions us well to offer agencies the products and services that address policyholders needs at competitive prices. We believe this focus provides us with relatively consistent and predictable risk-adjusted returns and enables us to selectively pursue business with favorable underwriting characteristics.  Leverage Scale, Technical Expertise and State-of-the-Art Underwriting Platforms to Provide Competitive Insurance Products and High Quality Services: We are the third largest writer of personal lines and the fifth largest writer of commercial lines property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, and the second largest writer of surety business in the United States, in each case based on 2008 net written premiums. We intend to continue to build on our scale and technical expertise to provide competitive insurance products and high quality services. As a result of our two most recent acquisitions, we are in the process of unifying our existing underwriting platforms in both our Commercial and Personal segments. The implementation of our unified underwriting platforms will allow us to retire our other underwriting platforms and, once fully implemented, we believe it will result in a decrease in our expense ratio. Our organization has the resources and financial flexibility to continue to devote significant efforts toward technology-based innovations and scale-based efficiencies, both of which are key factors for furthering our competitive advantage in the marketplace.  Capitalize on Fragmentation in the Property and Casualty Insurance Market: We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the fragmentation in the property and casualty insurance market by capturing market share. In commercial lines, we believe approximately $78 billion, or 57%, of the industrys total 2008 net written premiums were written by the approximately 550 insurers, excluding the top ten insurers, while the top ten insurers wrote the remaining approximately $58 billion, or 43%. In personal lines, we believe approximately $22 billion, or 34%, of the industrys total 2008 net written premiums were written by the approximately 370 insurers, excluding the top ten insurers, while the top ten insurers wrote the remaining approximately $43 billion, or 66%. We believe our national infrastructure will provide us with a competitive advantage over regional carriers in capturing market 4 Table of Contents share, while our regional focus will provide us with a competitive advantage over larger national carriers.  Optimize Capital and Leverage Financial Strength: We focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with the flexibility to pursue opportunistic growth. We are committed to disciplined underwriting, earnings growth and capital generation to maintain our financial strength and claims-paying ability ratings. We believe this further enhances our competitive advantage in attracting and retaining profitable business.  Pursue Accretive Strategic Acquisitions: We have successfully acquired and integrated businesses to accelerate the growth of our company. We intend to continue our strategy of pursuing economically attractive business combinations and acquisitions. Our market presence and strong balance sheet and cash flow, together with managements demonstrated acquisition integration experience, create an effective platform for our continued growth through strategic acquisitions. We will selectively pursue accretive strategic acquisitions with a focus on maximizing value for our stockholders. Ratings The strength of our balance sheet is reflected in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries: A with a negative outlook from A.M. Best (Excellent, the third highest of 15 ratings), A2 with a negative outlook from Moodys Investor Service Inc. (Moodys) (Good, the sixth highest of 21 ratings) (negative outlook), and A− with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors Rating Service (S&P) (Strong, the seventh highest of 21 ratings). Following our 2008 acquisition of Safeco, S&P downgraded the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries to A− from A, and Moodys revised its outlook to negative. Subsequently, in April 2009, A.M. Best revised its outlook to negative. These financial strength ratings do not refer to our ability to meet non-insurance obligations, and are not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy issued by us or to buy, hold or sell our securities. Transactions with Liberty Mutual We have effected several significant transactions since December 31, 2009 and intend to effect several additional significant transactions prior to consummation of this offering. These transactions, which we collectively refer to in this prospectus as the Transactions, involve several significant special payments and dividends to Liberty Mutual of cash and invested assets and the issuance of debt, a portion of which will be repaid prior to or immediately following the consummation of this offering. We believe that our capitalization following this offering will enable us to sustain profitable growth and maintain our financial strength ratings. As a result of the Transactions, we will have higher levels of debt and interest expense and lower levels of investment income in future periods. We also intend to enter into several agreements with Liberty Mutual prior to or substantially concurrently with the consummation of this offering, including the following:  Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. We will pay Liberty Mutual a one-time payment of $125 million and Liberty Mutual will indemnify us for up to $500 million of adverse development related to our run-off reserves in our Corporate and Other segment.  Services Agreement. Liberty Mutual currently provides all of our employees and executives to us under various services agreements. Liberty Mutual will provide interim services to us prior to the transfer to us of the employees and executives dedicated to our business, which is expected to occur on January 1, 2011. In addition, Liberty Mutual will continue to provide important administrative services to us under these agreements and will administer a portion of our run-off liabilities following the offering.  Intercompany Agreement. We will enter into an agreement with Liberty Mutual which will provide for, among other things, mutual indemnification of obligations relating to the business and operations of the other party, information rights, restrictive covenants that will prohibit actions by us without Liberty Mutuals consent, equity purchase rights, rights of first offer on property and casualty coverage, intellectual property licenses and other matters governing our ongoing relationship with Liberty Mutual. 5 Table of Contents For additional information about the Transactions and our ongoing agreements with Liberty Mutual, see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  The Transactions, Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Relationship with Liberty Mutual. Ownership by Liberty Mutual Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation, the issuer of the Class A common stock offered hereby, is currently an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc., a non-public mutual insurance holding company. The initial public offering of our Class A common stock represents an opportunity for Liberty Mutual to enhance its overall financial flexibility by enabling one of its significant business units to access the equity capital markets. Following this offering, Liberty Mutual will indirectly own all of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing % of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and % of our total equity ownership. Liberty Mutual will not own any of our outstanding Class A common stock. We intend to sell no more than a 20% equity interest in our company in this offering. Liberty Mutual has advised us that it expects to maintain a controlling interest in our company going forward. See Description of Capital Stock, Ownership of Common Stock and Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Relationship with Liberty Mutual. There is minimal overlap between our business and the other business units of Liberty Mutual. Our Commercial segment predominantly targets small and mid-size commercial customers, while Liberty Mutuals commercial lines business unit targets larger commercial customers. Our Personal segment distributes only through independent agencies, while Liberty Mutuals personal lines business unit utilizes entirely different distribution channels. Liberty Mutual does not participate in the surety segment of the United States property and casualty insurance market. Finally, we do not conduct business outside the United States, while Liberty Mutual distributes its products globally. Risk Factors There are a number of risks that you should understand before making an investment decision regarding this offering. These risks are discussed more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors following this prospectus summary. These risks include, but are not limited to: Risks relating to our business, such as:  claims arising out of unpredictable catastrophic events, including man-made disasters such as acts of terrorism;  our estimates regarding liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, including our liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures, which we refer to in this prospectus as A&E, and for other run-off liabilities may prove to be materially deficient;  our potential inability to mitigate risk through reinsurance arrangements;  claims arising out of our Surety segment expose us to potentially high severity losses;  our potential inability to maintain a strong network of independent agencies;  the potential for material losses in our investment portfolio;  the potential for ratings downgrades; and  constraints related to our status as a holding company. Risks relating to our relationship to Liberty Mutual, such as:  our reliance on Liberty Mutual for all employees and executives until January 1, 2011 and for critical services thereafter; 6 Table of Contents  our reliance on Liberty Mutual for the management of our investment portfolio;  differences in the voting power and rights of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the right of Liberty Mutual, as the holder of our Class B common stock, to elect 80% of the members of our board of directors;  Liberty Mutuals control of us and the relationship of Liberty Mutual with some of our directors and officers may cause conflicts of interest; and  the possibility that Liberty Mutual may in the future compete directly with us and is not restricted from soliciting our employees and management for employment with it.

These historical results are not necessarily indicative of results in any future period. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are not directly comparable. We acquired Safeco on September 22, 2008 and Ohio Casualty on August 24, 2007. Each of these acquisitions significantly increased the size of our existing business and expanded the scope of our operations. The financial results of each of these acquired businesses is only included in our consolidated results from and after the respective dates of acquisition. Non-recurring items related to these acquisitions also affect the comparability of our financial results. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial Information. The following tables also include summary pro forma financial data, which give pro forma effect to this offering and the Transactions for which we have made pro forma adjustments as described under Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements. The pro forma statement of operations data was prepared as if the Transactions and this offering had occurred on January 1, 2009 and the pro forma balance sheet data was prepared as if the Transactions and this offering had occurred on December 31, 2009. The pro forma financial data has been derived from our historical consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments that, in our opinion, are necessary to present fairly the pro forma consolidated financial statements. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The pro forma financial data is included for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the offering and the Transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor does it purport to project the results of our operations or financial condition for any future period or as of any future date. You should read the following summary financial data in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data, Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements and our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus, as well as the historical financial statements of Safeco and Ohio Casualty that are incorporated by reference in this prospectus. 9 Table of Contents Pro Forma Historical Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2009 (Dollars in millions, except share data) Statement of Operations Data Net written premiums $ 10,148 $ 6,704 $ 4,407 $ Net premiums earned 9,983 6,913 4,325 Net investment income 910 719 405 Fee and other revenues 97 50 33 Net realized investment losses (53 ) (407 ) (5 ) Total revenues 10,937 7,275 4,758 Claims and claim adjustment expenses 6,157 4,326 2,601 General and administrative expenses 1,005 777 551 Goodwill impairment(1)  973  Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 2,392 1,664 1,056 Interest expense 4 21 6 Total claims and expenses 9,558 7,761 4,214 Income (loss) before income tax expense 1,379 (486 ) 544 Income tax expense 377 78 167 Net income (loss) $ 1,002 $ (564 ) $ 377 $ Share Data Net income (loss) per common share: Basic $ $ $ $ Diluted $ $ $ $ Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic Diluted Non-GAAP Financial Measure (2) Pre-tax operating income $ 1,455 $ 934 $ 599 $ Reconciliation to net income (loss): Net income (loss) 1,002 (564 ) 377 Less: Net realized investment (losses) (53 ) (407 ) (5 ) Add: Income tax expense 377 78 167 Add: Goodwill impairment(1)  973  Add: Integration and other acquisition related costs 23 40 50 Pre-tax operating income $ 1,455 $ 934 $ 599 $ Combined Ratio Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio(3) 61.7 % 62.6 % 60.1 % Underwriting expense ratio(4) 31.9 % 33.0 % 35.0 % Combined ratio(5) 93.6 % 95.6 % 95.1 % Segment Data Net written premiums: Commercial $ 4,590 $ 3,975 $ 3,039 Personal 4,689 2,122 948 Surety 707 479 312 Corporate and Other 162 128 108 Pre-tax operating income: Commercial $ 521 $ 613 $ 500 Personal 429 86 71 Surety 252 156 96 Corporate and Other 253 79 (68 ) Segment combined ratios: Commercial 97.9 % 94.1 % 92.8 % Personal 94.8 % 101.1 % 97.1 % Surety 72.3 % 74.7 % 75.7 % 10 Table of Contents Historical Pro Forma As of December 31, As of December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2009 (Dollars in millions) Balance Sheet Data Cash and investments $ 22,504 $ 20,062 $ 11,313 $ Premium and other receivables, net 2,405 2,567 1,438 Goodwill 3,054 3,054 1,345 Other assets 4,423 5,250 2,543 Total assets 32,386 30,933 16,639 Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses 12,053 12,651 7,307 Long-term debt 59 82 216 Stockholders equity 12,197 10,301 5,465 (1) Our goodwill asset at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3,054 million, largely consisting of purchase price in excess of net assets relating to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions. These acquisitions resulted in significant cost synergies and other benefits throughout Liberty Mutual Group. Liberty Mutual Group performed an impairment analysis in the third quarter of 2009 using an income-based approach. Based on that analysis, the fair market value of Liberty Mutual Groups Agency Markets business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment was necessary. However, because the legal entities that gave rise to this goodwill are part of our company, when we prepared our carve-out financial statements we were required under GAAP to record the full amount of the historical goodwill on our balance sheet and to test that goodwill for our financial statements at each of our reporting units (i.e., segments), only taking into account the synergies and benefits realized by each of our segments, without regard to synergies and benefits realized elsewhere in the Liberty Mutual Group. We conducted an impairment analysis on each of our segments on this required basis in the fourth quarter of 2008, and determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for our Personal segment exceeded its fair value, and recognized an impairment charge in our Personal segment of $973 million in 2008. However, the carrying value of goodwill recorded in the consolidated financial statements of Liberty Mutual Group was unaffected. (2) We consider pre-tax operating income to be a useful supplement to net income (loss), its most comparable GAAP measure, in evaluating our financial performance. We believe that the presentation of pre-tax operating income is valuable because it assists an investor in determining the degree to which our insurance-related revenues, composed primarily of net premiums earned, net investment income and fee and other revenues, have generated operating earnings after meeting our insurance-related obligations, composed primarily of claims and claim adjustment expenses and other operating costs. (3) Calculated by dividing claims and claim adjustment expenses by net premiums earned. (4) Calculated by dividing the sum of general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs less fee revenues (which are charged to cover costs incurred as a result of premiums paid in installments) by net premiums earned. Integration and other acquisition related costs associated with the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, intangible amortization, and bad debt expenses have been excluded from the combined ratio. These costs are reflected within general and administrative expenses. (5) Calculated by adding the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. 11 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this prospectus before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Business Unpredictable catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including but not limited to hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, wildfires and volcanic eruptions. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist acts (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), riots, oil spills, utility outages, or consequences of war or political instability. The geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposures, including but not limited to hurricanes from Maine through Texas; tornadoes throughout the Central States and Southeast; earthquakes in California, the New Madrid region and the Pacific Northwest; and wildfires, particularly in California and the Southwest. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Some scientists believe that in recent years, changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters (including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, other storms and fires) in certain parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. It is possible that the frequency and severity of natural and man-made catastrophic events could increase. The catastrophe modeling tools that we use to help manage certain of our catastrophe exposures are based on assumptions, judgments and data entry that are subject to error and may produce estimates that are materially different from actual results. Changing climate conditions could cause our catastrophe models to be even less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively manage those exposures. See  We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, including legal, regulatory and social responses thereto, may have on our business. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Where we have geographic concentrations of policyholders, a single catastrophe or destructive weather trend affecting a region may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations. States have from time to time passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that has the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as legislation prohibiting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or mandating that insurers participate in residual market mechanisms. Participation in residual market mechanisms has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant claims or assessments to insurers, including us, and, in certain states, those claims or assessments may not be commensurate with our catastrophe exposure in those states. If our competitors leave those states having residual market mechanisms, remaining insurers, including us, may be subject to significant increases in claims or assessments following a catastrophe. In addition, following catastrophes, there are sometimes legislative initiatives and court decisions which seek to expand insurance coverage for catastrophe claims beyond the original intent of the policies. Also, our ability to increase pricing to the extent necessary to offset rising costs of catastrophes, particularly in our Personal segment, requires approval of the regulatory authorities of certain states. Our ability or our willingness to manage our catastrophe exposure by raising prices, modifying underwriting terms or reducing exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the evolving political environment and changes in the general economic climate. We also may choose for strategic purposes, such as improving our access to other underwriting opportunities, to write business in catastrophe-prone areas that we might not otherwise write. There are also risks that affect the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability to access portions of the affected 12 Table of Contents areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage; business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophes occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available. Catastrophe losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year and may materially harm our financial position, which in turn could adversely affect our financial strength and claims-paying ratings and could impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. Also, as a result of our exposure to catastrophe losses or following a catastrophe, rating agencies may further increase their capital requirements, which may require us to raise capital to maintain our ratings or adversely affect our ratings. A ratings downgrade could hurt our ability to compete effectively or attract new business. In addition, catastrophic events could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance. Such events can also affect the credit of our reinsurers. For a discussion of our catastrophe reinsurance coverage, see Business  Reinsurance Protection and Catastrophe Management. Catastrophic events could also adversely affect the credit of the issuers of securities, such as states or municipalities, in which we have invested, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition to catastrophe losses, the accumulation and development of losses from smaller weather-related events in any fiscal quarter or year could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in those periods. Because of the risks set forth above, catastrophes and the accumulation of losses from smaller weather-related events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may be inadequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, and as a result any inadequacy could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our success depends in part on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses and individuals that we insure. We are required to maintain adequate reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, which we refer to in this prospectus as loss reserves or unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. Reserves for these liabilities are typically composed of (1) case reserves for claims reported and (2) reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported, referred to as incurred but not reported, which we refer to in this prospectus as IBNR reserves. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Case reserves represent reserves established for reported claims. IBNR includes a reserve for unreported claims, future claims payments in excess of case reserves on recorded open claims, additional claims payments on closed claims, claims that have been reported but not recorded and the cost of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us to arrive at managements best estimate. IBNR reserves represent management estimates, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. In arriving at managements best estimate, management utilizes actuarial indications in conjunction with their knowledge and judgment about operational and environmental conditions. Consideration is given to any limitations in the actuarial methodologies and assumptions that may not be completely reflective of future loss emergence as well as to historical development on immature years, and the historical movement of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense estimates as these years typically mature. Loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. Establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. Because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our loss reserves at any given time could prove inadequate. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses Reserves and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 13 Table of Contents Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Risk Factors Inherent in the Estimation of Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses. We had established gross unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves of $12,053 million, $12,651 million and $7,307 million as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. If in the future we determine that our loss reserves are insufficient to cover our actual unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, we would have to add to our loss reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements. Additionally, we may be unable to collect all amounts due from our reinsurers under our reinsurance arrangements. We attempt to limit our risk of loss through reinsurance arrangements. The availability and cost of reinsurance protection is subject to market conditions, which are outside of our control. In addition, the coverage under our existing and future reinsurance contracts may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. As a result, we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through these arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In particular, the hardening of the reinsurance market in past years has led to increased prices or less favorable terms during the renewal of some of our reinsurance programs. We are not relieved of our obligation to our policyholders by purchasing reinsurance. Accordingly, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance if a reinsurer is unable to pay amounts owed to us as a result of a deterioration in its financial condition or if it simply is unwilling to pay due to a dispute or other factors beyond our control. In the past, certain reinsurers have ceased writing business and entered into run-off. Some of our reinsurance claims may be disputed by the reinsurers, and we may ultimately receive partial or no payment. This is a particular risk in the case of claims that relate to insurance policies written many years ago, including those relating to A&E claims. The ability of reinsurers to transfer their risks to other, less creditworthy reinsurers may adversely affect our ability to collect amounts due to us. Included in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements. Structured settlements comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers compensation claims constitute a significant portion. In cases where we did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables as we retain the contingent liability to the claimant. If the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, we would be required to make such payments. Many reinsurance companies and life insurance companies have been negatively affected by deteriorating financial and economic conditions, including the unprecedented financial market disruption in 2008 and 2009. A number of these companies, including those with which we conduct business, have been downgraded or have been placed on negative outlook by various rating agencies. Because of the risks set forth above, we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all. In addition, life insurance companies may fail to make required annuity payments. As a result, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our Surety segment exposes us to potentially high severity losses. We provide surety products through our Surety segment. The majority of our surety obligations are performance based guarantees. This business exposes us to infrequent, but potentially high severity, losses. We have customers with bonded exposure in excess of $100 million. The deterioration of one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For a description of our surety reinsurance arrangements with Liberty Mutual, see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement. 14 Table of Contents Disruptions to our relationships with our independent agencies could materially adversely affect us. We market our insurance products through approximately 13,000 independent agencies. Independent agents may sell our competitors products and may stop selling our products altogether. The number of traditional independent agencies has decreased due to consolidation from mergers and acquisitions, and independent agencies have increasing leverage with insurers seeking their business. Many insurers offer products similar to ours. In choosing an insurance carrier, our agents may consider ease of doing business, reputation, price of product, customer service, claims handling and the insurers compensation structure. We may be unable to compete with insurers that adopt more aggressive pricing policies or more generous compensation structures, offer a broader array of products, or have extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Loss of the business provided through independent agencies could have a material adverse effect on our future business volume and results of operations. We rely on internet applications to receive submissions from our agents, and we may increasingly rely on internet applications. In some instances, our agents are required to access separate business platforms to execute the sale of our personal insurance or commercial insurance products. Should internet disruptions occur, or frustration with our business platforms or distribution initiatives develop among our independent agents, the resulting loss of business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The persistence of the recent financial crisis or recurrence of a similar crisis could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Worldwide financial markets recently experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption including, among other things, dislocation in the mortgage and asset-backed securities markets, deleveraging and decreased liquidity generally, widening of credit spreads, bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions. These events resulted in extraordinary responses by governments worldwide, including the enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 in the U.S. Certain of the risk factors discussed in this prospectus identify risks that result from, or are exacerbated by, a prolonged economic slowdown or financial disruption. These include risks related to our investment portfolio, financing sources, reinsurance arrangements, other credit exposures, our estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, emerging claim and coverage issues, the competitive environment, regulatory developments and the impact of rating agency actions. While financial markets have stabilized, there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the timeline for economic recovery. As such, evolving market conditions may continue to adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In the event that a similar market disruption recurs, it could result in a prolonged economic downturn or recession and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity, and our premiums may be adversely affected by negative exposure changes at renewal, lower payrolls or sales of our policyholders, mid-term cancellations and fewer policy endorsements. Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material losses. Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability and investment values can materially impact stockholders equity. Investment grade bonds and short-term investments constituted approximately 92.1% of the fair value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2009. Our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. See  Interest rates may rise resulting in a decrease in the carrying value of our investments or a reduction in our liquidity. If the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio decreases, we may realize losses if we deem the value of our fixed income portfolio to be other-than-temporarily-impaired. In 2008, we recorded net realized investment losses of $209 million as a result of impairment losses on fixed maturity and equity investments related to securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired due to market conditions. Our investment grade bond portfolio is invested, in substantial part, in obligations of states, municipalities, and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). Notwithstanding the 15 Table of Contents relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations, the occurrence of a major economic downturn, widening credit spreads, budgetary deficits, or other events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of these securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and our net income to decline and the default rate of our fixed maturity securities portfolio to increase. Supplementing our broadly based portfolio of investment grade bonds, we invest in additional asset types with the objective of further enhancing the portfolios diversification and expected returns. These additional asset types include commercial mortgages and other real estate financing investments, non-investment grade bonds, and common and preferred stock. During or following an economic downturn or period of financial market disruption, our investment portfolio could be subject to higher risk. The value of our investment portfolio is subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities held in our portfolio. Such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. In 2008 and 2009, worldwide financial markets experienced significant disruptions and the United States and many other economies experienced a prolonged economic downturn, resulting in heightened credit risk, reduced valuation of investments and decreased economic activity. The financial market volatility and the resulting negative economic impact could continue and it is possible that it may be prolonged, which could adversely affect our current investment portfolio, make it difficult to determine the value of certain assets in our portfolio and/or make it difficult for us to purchase suitable investments that meet our risk and return criteria. These factors could cause us to realize less than expected returns on invested assets, sell investments for a loss or write off or write down investments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. With economic uncertainty, the credit quality and ratings of securities in our portfolio could be adversely affected. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which we refer to in this prospectus as the NAIC, could potentially apply a lower class code on a security than was originally assigned which could adversely affect statutory surplus because securities with NAIC class codes 3 through 6 are required to be carried at lower of cost or fair market value for statutory accounting purposes as compared to securities with NAIC class codes of 1 or 2 that are carried at amortized cost. Because of the risks set forth above, the value of our investment portfolio could decrease, we could experience reduced net investment income, and we could incur realized investment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Interest rates may rise resulting in a decrease in the carrying value of our investments or a reduction in our liquidity. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels. Changes in interest rates (inclusive of credit spreads) affect the carrying value of our investment grade bonds and returns on our investment grade bonds and short-term investments. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments, thereby negatively impacting our net investment income. Conversely, rising interest rates reduce the market value of existing investments in investment grade bonds. During periods of declining market interest rates, we would be forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed income securities could also decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which would increase the percentage of our portfolio that we would have to reinvest in lower-yielding investments of comparable credit quality or in lower quality investments offering similar yields. If interest rates increase, the market value of our fixed rate bond portfolio generally decreases. In the event we incur debt on which interest is tied to a floating interest rate, a rise in interest rates could increase our interest expense associated with such debt, resulting in a reduction to our liquidity. 16 Table of Contents The valuation of our investments include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Fixed maturity, equity, and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on the balance sheet, represented the majority of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2009. As required under accounting rules, we have categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), the next priority to quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, including (i) quoted prices (a) for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in Level 1 or (b) in markets that are not active or (ii) other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities (Level 2) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the exit price, including assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (Level 3). An asset or liabilitys classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. We generally use a combination of independent pricing services and broker quotes to price our investment securities. At December 31, 2009, approximately 3.7%, 94.8% and 1.5% of these securities represented Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3, respectively. However, prices provided by independent pricing services and independent broker quotes can vary widely even for the same security. To the extent that we are incorrect in our determination of fair value of our investment securities, or our determination that a decline in their value is other-than-temporary, we may realize losses that never actually materialize or may fail to recognize losses within the appropriate period. Rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could increase the difficulty in valuing certain of our securities and materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may result in an increase in non-cash other-than-temporary-impairment charges, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments has a degree of subjectivity and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is based on our periodic evaluation and assessment of our investments and known and inherent risks associated with the various asset classes. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in impairments as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. We review fixed maturity, public equity securities, private equity securities and private equity co-investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. Securities are reviewed for both quantitative and qualitative considerations including, but not limited to: (a) the extent of the decline in fair value below book value, (b) the duration of the decline, (c) significant adverse changes in the financial condition or near term prospects for the investment or issuer, (d) significant changes in the business climate or credit ratings of the issuer, (e) general market conditions and volatility, (f) industry factors, and (g) the past impairment of the security holding or the issuer. For fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, we separate impairments into credit loss and non-credit loss components. The determination of the credit loss component of the impairment charge is based on managements best estimate of the present value of the cash flows to be collected from the debt security compared to its amortized cost, and it is reported as part of net realized gains (losses). The non-credit component, the residual difference between the credit impairment component and the fair value, is recognized in other comprehensive income. The factors considered in making an evaluation for credit versus non-credit other-than-temporary impairment include the following: (a) failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments (including the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood the issuer 17 Table of Contents will be able to make payments that increase in the future), (b) performance indicators of the underlying assets in the security (including default and delinquency rates), (c) vintage (generally the year that the mortgage or asset back security was originated), (d) geographic concentration, (e) industry analyst reports and sector credit ratings and (f) volatility of the securitys fair value. For non-fixed maturity investments and fixed maturity investments which we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount (fair value less amortized cost) of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses). Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our business could be harmed because our potential exposure for A&E claims and related litigation is unique and very difficult to predict, and our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded loss reserves and amounts available under the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. We have exposure to A&E claims that emanate principally from general liability policies written prior to the mid-1980s. Asbestos claims relate primarily to injuries asserted by those who allegedly came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up cost obligations, particularly as mandated by federal and state environmental protection agencies. The process of establishing loss reserves for A&E claims is subject to greater uncertainty than the establishment of loss reserves for liabilities relating to other types of insurance claims. If we have not established adequate loss reserves to cover current and future A&E claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We estimate our net A&E loss reserves based upon numerous factors, including the facts surrounding reported cases and exposures to claims, such as policy limits and deductibles, current law, past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims, reinsurance coverage as well as analysis of industry studies and events, such as recent settlements and asbestos-related bankruptcies. Several factors make it difficult to determine future A&E claims activity, including: (i) the lack of available and reliable historical claims data as an indicator of future loss development; (ii) the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of bodily injury or property damage; (iii) the difficulty in identifying the source of A&E contamination; (iv) the difficulty in properly allocating liability for asbestos or environmental damage, (v) the uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, (vi) the cost to resolve claims, and (vii) the collectability of reinsurance. The uncertainties associated with establishing loss reserves for A&E claims and claim adjustment expenses are compounded by the differing, and at times inconsistent, court rulings on A&E coverage issues, including: (i) differing interpretations of various insurance policy provisions and whether A&E losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered; (ii) when the loss occurred and what policies provide coverage; (iii) whether there is an insured obligation to defend; (iv) whether a compensable loss or injury has occurred; (v) how policy limits are determined; (vi) how policy exclusions are applied and interpreted; (vii) the impact of entities seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities; (viii) whether clean-up costs are covered as insured property damage; and (ix) applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products or completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. As a result of the significant uncertainty inherent in determining our A&E liabilities, the amount of reserves required to adequately fund our A&E claims cannot be accurately estimated using conventional reserving methodologies based upon historical data and trends and, as a result, the use of conventional reserving methodologies frequently has to be supplemented by subjective considerations, including management judgment. Thus, the ultimate amount of our A&E exposures may vary materially from the reserves currently recorded and could exceed the currently recorded reserves. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For more information about A&E claims, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves  Corporate and Other  Run-Off Operations  Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. Because the level of uncertainty is high and in order to strengthen our ability and flexibility to advance our strategic goals following our initial public offering, we will enter into a Run-Off Indemnification 18 Table of Contents Agreement with Liberty Mutual. Under the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement, Liberty Mutual will indemnify us for any adverse development of our reserves for our run-off operations up to $500 million. However, given the high level of uncertainty in estimating our run-off operations, the ultimate liabilities may exceed this $500 million cap. Further, the indemnification provided under the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement is subject to Liberty Mutuals ability to fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Any adverse development of our net A&E and other indemnified liabilities in excess of the $500 million cap, as well as any bankruptcy or insolvency of, or refusal or inability to make payments under the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement by, Liberty Mutual, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The Run-Off Indemnification Agreement is described in more detail in Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. For additional information relating to how we estimate our reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for our run-off liabilities, including our A&E reserves, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves  Corporate and Other  Run-Off Operations. We may suffer losses from unfavorable outcomes from litigation and other legal proceedings, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings as part of the claims process, the outcomes of which are uncertain. We maintain reserves for these legal proceedings as part of our reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. We also maintain separate reserves for legal proceedings that are not related to the claims process. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more legal matters, our ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts we have currently reserved for and such additional amounts may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For a description of our material legal proceedings, see Business  Legal Proceedings. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:  claims relating to alleged abuse by clergy;  judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability;  plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices;  claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions;  the assertion of public nuisance theories of liability, pursuant to which plaintiffs seek to recover money spent to administer public health care programs or to abate hazards to public health and safety;  claims relating to Chinese drywall, which may involve drywall manufacturers, distributors, installers, contractors, homeowners and others; and  our use of medical bill review vendors. In some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued. In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, recent shifts in the political landscape could increase the likelihood of the passing of such legislation in a number of states. 19 Table of Contents The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Industry investigations by governmental authorities may adversely affect our business. In 2004, a number of affiliated entities engaged in the insurance business, including our company, received subpoenas and other requests from various state Attorneys General and other insurance, governmental and enforcement authorities requesting information regarding broker sales practices, contingent commissions and improper quotations. In 2006, as an affiliate of Liberty Mutual, we were named in a civil action filed by the Connecticut Attorney General  State of Connecticut v. Liberty Mutual Holding Company, Inc., et al., UWY-CV-06-402472-S. The Attorneys General for the States of Illinois and New York filed similar actions against several of our affiliates but we were not named in those actions. The Connecticut complaint contains allegations concerning insurance broker sales practices, contingent commissions and improper quotations. The complaint alleges claims for breach of the Connecticut antitrust act and unfair trade practices act. Two individuals employed by Liberty Mutual and working in completely separate and distinct business units appear to have violated policy by serving their own personal interests by providing Marsh Inc.s Global Broking Excess Casualty unit with a small number of false quotes. Both are no longer employees of Liberty Mutual. We have never employed the individuals nor did they ever act on behalf of our company. We cooperated with the investigation into these matters and engaged in a dialogue to resolve the claims. We have concluded that Connecticuts settlement demand was excessive and unreasonable. We continue to pursue dismissal of these cases. Discovery has not yet begun in any of the cases. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these matters may have on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business operations. In addition to exposure to credit risk related to our investment portfolio, reinsurance recoverables and surety insurance operations discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business operations, including credit risk relating to policyholders and independent agencies. Our surety operations involve guaranteeing to a third party that our customer will satisfy certain performance obligations (for example, a construction contract) or certain financial obligations and therefore expose us to credit risk. In accordance with industry practice, when customers purchase surety bonds from us through independent agencies, the premiums relating to those bonds are often paid to the agencies for payment to us. In most jurisdictions, the premiums will be deemed to have been paid to us whether or not they are actually received by us. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agencies. Also, if our customer defaults, we may suffer losses and be unable to be reimbursed by our customer. To a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy. Accordingly, we face a greater risk in an economic downturn. While we attempt to manage the risks discussed above through underwriting and investment guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. For example, collateral obtained may subsequently have little or no value. As a result, our exposure to the above credit risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Terrorist acts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and our ability to reinsure or manage such risk is limited. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, which we refer to in this prospectus as the Program, established under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (Reauthorization Act), collectively referred to in this prospectus as the Terrorism Acts, generally requires all commercial property and casualty insurers writing business in the U.S. to make terrorism coverage available to commercial policyholders and provides a Federal backstop for certified terrorist acts, which result in losses above 20 Table of Contents individual insurance company deductible amounts. The Terrorism Acts directly apply to our U.S. property and casualty insurance business. In 2010, on eligible lines of business, participating insurers will receive reimbursement from the Federal government for 85% of paid losses in excess of the insurers deductible, provided the aggregate industry losses exceed $100 million to a maximum industry loss of $100 billion. The deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of an insurers and its affiliates direct premiums earned for covered lines for the preceding calendar year. We estimate that the amount that we (together with the insurance subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual) will collectively have to pay in the context of a covered loss before the Federal backstop becomes available is $1.757 billion for 2010. If our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates were not affiliates of Liberty Mutual, the amount we would have to pay in 2010 would be $792 million. Certain lines of business that we write, including commercial automobile, professional liability (excluding directors and officers), surety, burglary and theft, and farmowners multiple peril are exempted from coverage under the Terrorism Acts. In the case of a war declared by Congress, only workers compensation losses are covered by the Terrorism Acts. Under the Terrorism Acts, we must include the direct premiums earned of all of our insurance company affiliates, whether or not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by us, in calculating our deductible. This includes the insurance company subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual. Under the terms of the Intercompany Agreement, we and Liberty Mutual will agree that any recovery from the Federal government under the Program to any Liberty Mutual Group affiliated insurers will be allocated to each insurer in the proportion its insured losses (net of collectible reinsurance) bear to its and its affiliates aggregate insured losses (net of collectible reinsurance) under the Program. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement  Allocation of Coverage under the Terrorism Acts. As of the effective date of the Reauthorization Act, December 26, 2007, the U.S. government may certify, and the Program will cover, losses caused by any individual, foreign or domestic. Damage outside the U.S. is not covered except in limited circumstances. The Program will remain in effect until December 31, 2014. There can be no assurance that it will be extended beyond that date. In the event that the Program is not extended beyond December 31, 2014 and in the absence of a private reinsurance market for terrorism reinsurance, we may be required to accept financial responsibility for losses that we would not otherwise insure unless state insurance departments allow for the non-renewal of business with significant terrorism risk exposure or the exclusion of coverage for terrorism risks under policy renewals. Because the Terrorism Acts are relatively new and their interpretation is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how they will be applied to specific circumstances. It is also possible that future legislative action could change the Terrorism Acts. Further, given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in our own reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly unconventional acts of terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in future periods. See Regulation  Terrorism. Independent of limitations on coverage under the Program, the occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. Private sector catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. Accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. This would likely cause us to increase our loss reserves. Further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. These consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. The continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. Terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operation centers and business capabilities generally. As a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 21 Table of Contents The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively in the future. The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and has, from time to time, experienced severe price competition. We compete with numerous regional insurance companies, including Acuity, Auto-Owners Insurance Group, Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Erie Insurance Group, Hanover Insurance Group, Harleysville Group, Selective Insurance Group, Unitrin, Inc. and W.R. Berkley Corporation, as well as national insurance companies, including The Chubb Corporation, CNA Financial Corporation, Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., The Travelers Companies, Inc. and Zurich Financial Services Group. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing or management resources than we do and have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the insurance industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage for them. In addition, several property and casualty insurers writing commercial lines of business now offer products for alternative forms of risk protection, including large deductible programs and various forms of self-insurance that utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention groups. Continued growth in alternative forms of risk protection could reduce our premium volume. Following the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, a number of new insurers and reinsurers were formed to compete in our industry, and a number of existing market participants have raised new capital which may enhance their ability to compete. A number of our competitors may offer products at prices and on terms that are not consistent with our economic standards in an effort to maintain their business or write new business. In particular, the competitive environment has adversely impacted commercial lines rates and retention over the past few years, which have reduced our underwriting margins. If rates and retention in commercial lines continue to decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our competitive position is based not only on our ability to profitably price our business, but also on product features and quality, scale, customer service, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities, name recognition, and agent compensation. We may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. In addition, in our Personal segment, the agencies upon whom we rely compete with direct writers of insurance, who are often able to offer substantial discounts in pricing as compared to our insurance products. If our agents experience increased competition from direct writers of insurance, we in turn could be adversely affected if they are unable to maintain a competitive position in their respective markets. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected. Our underwriting results are dependent on our ability to match rate to risk. If our pricing models fail to price risks accurately, our profitability may be adversely affected. The profitability of our property and casualty business substantially depends on the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in pricing our policies. We use automated underwriting tools for the preponderance of our property and casualty products, as well as tiered pricing structures to match our premium rates to the risks we insure. As we expand our appetite into different markets and products, we will write more policies in markets and geographical areas where we have less data specific to these new markets, and accordingly may be more susceptible to error in our models or claims adjustment. If we fail to appropriately price the risks we insure, change our pricing model to reflect our current experience, or our claims experience is more frequent or severe than our underlying risk assumptions, our profit margins may be negatively affected. To the extent we have overpriced risks, new-business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected. 22 Table of Contents Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. We are extensively regulated and supervised in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. This regulatory system is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders and other investors. This system addresses, among other things:  licensing companies and agents to transact business, and authorizing lines of business;  calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;  mandating certain insurance benefits;  regulating certain premium rates;  reviewing and approving policy forms;  regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;  establishing statutory capital and surplus requirements;  approving changes in control of insurance companies;  restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates;  establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements;  requiring insurers to dividend to policyholders any excess profits;  regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments; and  regulating a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurers business. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In view of recent events involving certain financial institutions and the financial markets, it is possible that the U.S. federal government will heighten its oversight of insurers. Congress and some federal agencies continue to investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to allow an optional federal charter, similar to the option available to most banks. In addition to an optional federal insurance charter, the President has proposed and the Congress is considering legislation that could affect the regulation of financial institutions, including insurance companies, and financial activities that represent a systemic risk to financial stability or the U.S. economy. The legislation would establish a federal systemic risk regulator to identify large, interconnected financial institutions that would be subject to heightened prudential standards. The proposed legislative changes could affect the capital, liquidity and leverage ratios of a company so designated. The legislation may also require certain financial institutions, including certain large insurance companies, to make payments to the federal government to help capitalize federal funds that would be established to reduce the potential liability of U.S. taxpayers during times of extreme financial stress or economic instability in the United States. Additionally, the legislation would establish a federal insurance office within the U.S. Treasury Department. The director of the office would be empowered to recommend to the federal systemic risk regulator that an insurance company be subject to heightened prudential standards. The legislation may also pre-empt state law in certain instances involving the regulation of reinsurance and other limited insurance matters. In the future, 23 Table of Contents additional federal regulation may be enacted which could affect the way we conduct our business and could result in higher compliance costs. We cannot predict whether any proposed legislation or regulatory changes will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Further, in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn, regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations. For example, insurance regulators may choose to restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies or reject rate increases due to the economic environment. Our ability to change our rates in response to competition or to increased costs depends, in part, on whether the applicable state insurance rate regulation laws requires the prior approval of a rate increase by or notification to the applicable insurance regulators either before or after a rate increase is imposed. See Regulation  Rate and Form Approvals. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If there were to be changes to statutory or regulatory requirements, we may be unable to fully comply with or maintain all required insurance licenses and approvals. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have all requisite licenses and approvals, or do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our insurance activities or monetarily penalize us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation or regulatory initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. See Regulation. Insurance laws or regulations that are adopted or amended, in addition to changes in federal statutes, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, financial services regulations and federal taxation, may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and may result in lower revenues or higher costs of compliance and thus could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and limit our growth. The amount of statutory capital that we have and must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control. Accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for our insurance subsidiaries are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the NAIC. Insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital (RBC) formulas for insurance companies. The RBC formula for property and casualty companies adjusts statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. In any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors  the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the NAIC RBC formulas. Most of these factors are outside of our control. Our financial strength ratings are significantly influenced by our insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios. Due to all of these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related RBC ratios is complex. 24 Table of Contents Changes to methods of marketing and underwriting in certain areas are subject to state-imposed restrictions. Our ability to change our methods of marketing and underwriting in certain areas, such as in California and in the coastal areas of Florida and New York, are subject to state-imposed restrictions. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to significantly reduce our exposure in these areas. Mandated market mechanisms may require us to underwrite policies with a higher risk of loss and assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds and second-injury funds may reduce our profitability. We are often required to participate directly or indirectly in mandatory shared market mechanisms as a condition of our licenses to do business in certain states. These markets, which are commonly referred to as residual markets or involuntary markets, generally consist of risks considered to be undesirable from a standard or routine underwriting perspective. In 2009, approximately 1% of our net written premiums related to our participation in mandatory shared market mechanisms. Underwriting performance related to assigned risk plans, a form of mandated market mechanism, is typically adverse and, as a result, we are required to underwrite some policies with a higher risk of loss than we would normally accept. Each state dictates the level of insurance coverage that is mandatorily assigned to participating insurers within these markets. Typically, the amount of involuntary policies we are obligated to write in a given year is based on our historical market share of all voluntary policies written within that state for particular lines of business. Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred (based on future premiums for property and casualty insurance lines of business). As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, included in other assets were $4 million and $2 million, respectively, of related assets for premium tax offsets or policy surcharges. The related asset is limited to the amount that is determined based on future premium collections or policy surcharges from policies in force. Current assessments are expected to be paid out over the next five years, while premium tax offsets are expected to be realized within one year. In addition, virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These guaranty funds are funded by assessments. The liability balance was $31 million as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008. The effect of these assessments or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these matters may have on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity or on the property and casualty insurance industry. We may not maintain favorable financial strength ratings, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct business. We may not maintain favorable financial strength ratings, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength, including claims-paying ability, of insurers and reinsurers. These ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies and are subject to revision at any time at the sole discretion of the agencies. Some of the criteria relate to general economic conditions and other circumstances outside the rated companys control. These financial strength ratings are used by policyholders and independent agents as an important means of assessing the suitability of insurers as business counterparties and have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. These financial strength ratings do not refer to our ability to meet non-insurance obligations, and are not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy issued by us or to buy, hold or sell our securities. Our insurance subsidiaries current financial strength ratings are A (Excellent, the third highest of 15 ratings)(negative outlook) from A.M. Best, A2 (Good, the sixth highest of 21 ratings) (negative outlook) from Moodys, and A− (Strong, the seventh highest of 21 ratings)(stable outlook) from S&P. Periodically, the rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us. A downgrade or withdrawal of our financial strength ratings could limit 25 Table of Contents or prevent our insurance subsidiaries from writing new insurance policies or renewing existing insurance policies, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are also parties to an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement that allows them to obtain a uniform rating from A.M. Best. If one or a few of the insurance subsidiaries or controlled affiliates experience a deterioration in its financial condition, the uniform rating of the entire pool could suffer a downgrade. We anticipate that our financial strength ratings will be coupled with the financial strength ratings of Liberty Mutual. See  Risks Relating to our Relationship with Liberty Mutual  Our financial strength ratings will be dependent upon the financial strength ratings of Liberty Mutual and could be adversely affected in the event that Liberty Mutuals financial condition deteriorates. In view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, including our competitors in the insurance industry, it is possible that the external rating agencies: (1) will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions; (2) will increase the frequency and scope of their reviews; and (3) may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notices by any rating agency which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We are a holding company with no direct operations, and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us is restricted by law. As a holding company with no direct operations and whose only significant assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to pay our expenses. Our subsidiaries may not be able to generate cash flow sufficient to pay a dividend or distribute funds to us. In addition, applicable state laws that regulate the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries could prohibit such dividends or distributions. Under the insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled, an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities. Generally, our insurance subsidiaries have the ability to pay dividends during any 12-month period, without having to obtain the prior approval of regulatory authorities, in an amount equal to the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year, subject to the availability of unassigned funds. For the first three months of 2010, our insurance subsidiaries declared and paid ordinary and extraordinary dividends to Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation totaling approximately $2.471 billion. As a result of these dividends, our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay ordinary dividends to us for the remainder of 2010 was exhausted and the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries as of March 31, 2010 was $5.091 billion. In connection with a dividend we intend to declare to Liberty Mutual prior to the completion of this offering, we intend to seek regulatory approval for our top-tier insurance subsidiaries to make distributions in an aggregate amount of up to $ million. We believe that our cash balances, cash flows from operations and cash flows from investments are adequate to meet expected cash requirements for the foreseeable future on both a holding company and operating subsidiary level. However, if our insurance subsidiaries cannot pay dividends in future periods, beginning in 2010, we may have difficulty paying dividends on our common stock and meeting our holding company expenses. For additional information relating to insurance regulations governing our operations, see Regulation. Inflation, including repair costs and medical inflation, could have a material adverse effect on our results. Historically, massive government spending aimed at spurring the economy has been followed by increased inflation. The effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims from catastrophes or other events to rise in the future. Our reserves for claims and claim adjustment expenses includes assumptions about future payments 26 Table of Contents for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses, such as repair costs, medical expenses and litigation costs. To the extent that actual inflation increases significantly more than such assumptions, we may be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Cyclicality of the property and casualty insurance industry may cause fluctuations in our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The property and casualty insurance business is cyclical in nature and has historically been characterized by periods of intense price competition, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Periods of intense price competition historically have alternated with periods when shortages of underwriting capacity have permitted attractive premium levels. Any significant decrease in the premium rates we can charge for property and casualty insurance would adversely affect our results. Our Personal and Commercial segments are particularly affected by the cyclicality of loss cost trends. Factors that affect loss cost trends in automobile underwriting include inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care, litigation of liability claims, improved automobile safety features, legislative changes and general economic conditions. Factors that affect loss costs trends in property underwriting include inflation in the cost of building materials and labor costs and demand caused by weather-related catastrophes. Factors that affect loss cost trends in workers compensation underwriting include inflation in the cost of medical care, litigation of liability claims and general economic conditions. Property and casualty insurers, including us, are often unable to increase premium rates until some time after the costs associated with the coverage have increased, primarily as a result of state insurance regulation and laws. Therefore, in a period of increasing loss costs, profit margins decline. We expect to continue to experience the effects of this cyclicality which, during down periods, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Loss of or significant restriction on the use of credit scoring, education and occupation data in the pricing and underwriting of our products could reduce our future profitability. We use credit scoring, education and occupation data as factors in pricing decisions where permitted under state law. Some consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring, education and occupation data unfairly discriminates against lower-income, minority and elderly consumers and are calling for the prohibition of or restriction on the use of such factors in underwriting and pricing. Enactment in a large number of states of laws or regulations that significantly curtail the use of credit scoring, education or occupation data in the underwriting process could reduce our future profitability. We could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and investment activities, many of which are highly complex. These activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. If our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk exposure (including underwriting, credit and investment risk) or damage to our reputation. Potential changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our investment portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits. Due in large part to the recent financial crisis that has affected the federal and many state governments, there may be a risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and/or their policyholders. Whether in connection with crisis management, deficit reduction, or various types of 27 Table of Contents fundamental tax reform, federal or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us and could adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio. Such changes could also result in lapses of policies currently held and/or our incurrence of materially higher corporate taxes. Our participation in a securities lending program subjects us to potential liquidity and other risks. We have engaged in securities lending activities from which we generate net investment income from the lending of certain of our fixed maturity and short-term investments to other institutions. Our securities lending program is managed by Liberty Mutual, which is responsible for borrower identification and screening, lending activities and collateral management. We generally obtain cash or securities collateral from borrowers of these securities in an amount equal to at least 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest, which is obtained at the inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 102% for the duration of the loan. At December 31, 2009, we had no loans outstanding where we had accepted at the inception of the loan collateral less than 102% of the fair value of such loaned securities. This collateral is held by a third-party custodian, and we have the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing our securities is in default under the lending agreement. The loaned securities remain our recorded asset. Our collateral reinvestment guidelines encourage a risk adverse investment allocation of cash received as collateral for loans. We accept cash as collateral for securities on loan and restrict the manner in which that cash is subsequently invested. We do not recognize the receipt of securities collateral held by the third-party custodian or the obligation to return the securities collateral; however, we do recognize the receipt of cash collateral and the corresponding obligation to return the cash collateral. Returns of loaned securities by the third parties would require us to return any collateral associated with such loaned securities. In some cases, the maturity of the securities held as invested collateral (i.e., securities that we have purchased with cash received from the third parties) may exceed the term of the related securities on loan and the estimated fair value may fall below the amount of cash received as collateral and invested. If we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice and we are forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation, we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions, or both. In addition, under stressful capital market and economic conditions, such as those conditions we experienced during 2008 and 2009, liquidity broadly deteriorates, which may further restrict our ability to loan securities. If we decrease the amount of our securities lending activities over time, the amount of investment income generated by these activities will also likely decline. Our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective utilization of information technology systems and our implementation of technology innovations. We depend on information technology systems for conducting business and processing insurance claims. Access to these technology systems, along with the development and support of them, are provided by Liberty Mutual pursuant to the Intercompany Agreement and a services agreement that we will enter into with Liberty Mutual in connection with this offering, which we refer to in this prospectus as the Services Agreement. Critical elements of our business operations are dependent on the continued maintenance and availability of these existing technology systems. Our continued long-term success requires that we remain innovative and select strategic technology initiatives, in a cost and resource efficient manner, to drive down overall expenses and improve the value to the business. As a subsidiary of Liberty Mutual, we have access to a variety of technology system development projects, such as the current creation of a unified underwriting platform by Liberty Mutual. These types of strategic initiatives are long-term in nature and may be affected by a variety of unknown business and technology related factors. As a result, the potential associated chargeback expenses relating to these projects from Liberty Mutual may adversely impact our expense ratios if they exceed our current estimates. Further, the technology system development process may not deliver the benefits and efficiencies that we expected during the initial stages of the projects. 28 Table of Contents We rely on a variety of software license agreements with third party vendors that are held by Liberty Mutual. Following this offering, we expect to continue to rely on Liberty Mutual and its affiliates and their agreements with such third party vendors for the provision of necessary software and information technology services pursuant to the Intercompany Agreement and the Services Agreement. In addition, we do not own any of our operating systems or underwriting platforms. Liberty Mutual licenses these systems to us pursuant to the terms of the Intercompany Agreement. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement. Liberty Mutuals agreements with third party vendors pursuant to which we receive certain of our software and technology may not allow us to continue to receive the benefits of such agreements once we are no longer a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual. There is no assurance that we will be able to replace the third party software in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including cost, as favorable to those we received through Liberty Mutual. Additionally, in the event Liberty Mutual ceases to own more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, Liberty Mutual also may terminate our operating system and underwriting platform licenses. See Certain Relationships and Related party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement. Although we have the right to enter into a transition services agreement with Liberty Mutual for a period of at least 18, but not more than 36, months following termination of these licenses, we will be responsible for any license or other costs associated with continued access to software provided by third party vendors. At the termination of the transition services agreement, Liberty Mutual has agreed to license us the software for our core claims, underwriting, financial reporting and billing systems, including ECLPS. However, Liberty Mutual may terminate these licenses in the event we undergo a change in control or a material change in our business occurs. Even though we will have licenses for these systems and platforms, there is no assurance that these systems and platforms will be able to be maintained at the same levels or at the same costs as they were when we were receiving information technology services directly from Liberty Mutual. Our ability to provide competitive services to agencies and new and existing policyholders in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement strategic initiatives could be adversely affected by either an increase in costs for these projects or our inability to obtain them from Liberty Mutual. We may not be able to meet our information technology requirements in a manner or on terms and conditions, including costs, as favorable as those we have previously received from Liberty Mutual, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or liquidity. If we experience difficulties with technology or data security, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively affected. Liberty Mutual provides us with technology and data security services under the Services Agreement. While technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present certain risks. We use computer systems, including our automated underwriting platforms, to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. Our information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party information networks and systems. Our business is highly dependent on the availability, speed and reliability of these networks and systems to perform necessary business functions, such as providing new-business quotes, processing new and renewal business, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, and providing customer support. Our information technology systems and the networks on which we rely may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptions. A shut-down of, or inability to, access one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a disruption of one or more of these information technology, telecommunications or other systems or networks could significantly impair our ability to perform those functions on a timely basis, which could hurt our business and our relationships with our agents and policyholders. Computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches. These increased risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security, 29 Table of Contents could expose us to data loss, monetary and reputational damage and significant increases in compliance costs. As a result, our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected. In the event of a disaster, our business continuity plan may not be sufficient, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Liberty Mutual provides us with business continuity services through the Services Agreement. Our infrastructure supports a combination of local and remote recovery solutions for business resumption in the event of a disaster. In the event of either the destruction of any of our office buildings or the inability to access any of those buildings, our business recovery plan provides for our employees to perform their work functions via a dedicated business recovery site located approximately 50 miles from our main office, by remote access from an employees home or by relocation of employees to our other offices. However, in the event of a full scale local or regional disaster, our business recovery plan may be inadequate, and our employees and sales representatives may be unable to carry out their work, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences. We will selectively investigate and pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunity is consistent with our long-term objectives and that the potential rewards of the acquisition exceed the risks. The process of integrating an acquired company or business can be complex and costly, however, and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. For example, acquisitions may present significant risks, including:  the potential disruption of our ongoing business;  the reduction in cash available for operations and other uses and the potential dilutive issuance of equity securities or the incurrence of debt;  the ineffective integration of underwriting, claims handling and actuarial practices and systems;  the increase in the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the combined organization, as past trends (that were a function of past products, past claims handling procedures, past claims departments and past legal and other experts) may not repeat themselves;  the diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges;  the loss of key employees; and  the cultural challenges associated with integrating employees. There is no guarantee that any businesses acquired in the future will be successfully integrated, and the ineffective integration of our businesses and processes may result in substantial costs or delays and adversely affect our ability to compete. Also, the acquired business may not perform as projected, and any cost savings and other synergies anticipated from the acquisition may not materialize. We are subject to a variety of modeling risks which could have a material adverse impact on our business results; in the absence of an industry standard for catastrophe modeling, our estimates may not be comparable to other insurance companies. Property and casualty business is exposed to many risks. These risks are a function of the environments within which we operate. Certain exposures can be correlated with other exposures, and an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of our company simultaneously and have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. These exposures require an entity-wide view of risk and an understanding of the potential impact on all areas of our company. 30 Table of Contents We rely on complex financial models, including computer models and modeling techniques, which have been developed internally or by third parties to provide information on items such as historical loss costs and pricing, trends in claims severity and frequency, the effects of catastrophe losses, investment performance and portfolio risk. For example, we estimate a probable maximum loss, which we refer to in this prospectus as PML, for various catastrophe exposures using models and other tools that require assumptions around several variables to model the event and its potential impact. Inadequacies in the models and modeling techniques that we use and/or faulty assumptions or granularity of data could lead to actual losses being materially higher than we anticipated based on our analysis of the modeled scenarios. As a result, we could experience unexpectedly high losses through concentrated risk in certain geographic areas, we could make ineffective or inefficient reinsurance purchases, and/or suffer unnecessary investment losses. While the models and modeling techniques that we use are relatively sophisticated, the value of the quantitative market risk information they generate is limited by the limitations of the modeling process. We believe that financial and computer modeling techniques alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. Therefore, such modeling techniques do not substitute for the experience or judgment of our senior management. There is no industry standard for the modeling of catastrophe risk. As a result, our estimates may not be comparable to those of other insurance companies. We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, including legal, regulatory and social responses thereto, may have on our business. Various scientists, environmentalists, international organizations, regulators and other commentators believe that global climate change has added, and will continue to add, to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters (including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, freezes, other storms and fires) in certain parts of the world. In response to this belief, a number of legal and regulatory measures as well as social initiatives have been introduced in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas and other carbon emissions which some believe may be chief contributors to global climate change. We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, will have on our results of operations or our financial condition. Moreover, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and social responses to concerns about global climate change will impact our business. We will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company. As a public company, we will incur legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, which we refer to in this prospectus as Sarbanes-Oxley, particularly Section 404, and related rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to in this prospectus as the SEC, and the New York Stock Exchange, which we refer to in this prospectus as the NYSE, regulate corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect that compliance with these public company requirements will increase our costs and make some activities more time-consuming than they have been in the past when we were wholly-owned by Liberty Mutual. While we have spent considerable time and resources assisting Liberty Mutual in its voluntary efforts to comply in substance with certain requirements similar to those imposed on publicly-traded companies by Sarbanes-Oxley, we will incur all expenses of complying with Sarbanes-Oxley and other federal securities laws ourselves going forward. Risks Relating to Our Relationship with Liberty Mutual We have no experience operating as a stand-alone company and immediately following this offering we will not have our own employees or executives until January 1, 2011 and will be solely dependent on the management, personnel and facilities of Liberty Mutual, and will thereafter remain significantly dependent on Liberty Mutual. Prior to this offering, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual Group. As a wholly-owned subsidiary, we had no employees or executives and relied solely on Liberty Mutual for all necessary services, 31 Table of Contents including for expertise in all areas of our business and operations. Immediately following this offering, all personnel whose employment is dedicated to our business and operations, including our executive officers, will remain the employees of Liberty Mutual, subject to a planned transfer of certain of those employees and officers to us by January 1, 2011 (the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees). Until Liberty Mutual transfers the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees to us or we directly hire employees to work for us, we will remain solely dependent upon Liberty Mutual to provide all necessary services for our businesses. Following the transfer, Liberty Mutual employees will continue to provide us with certain accounting and reporting, actuarial, administration, advertising and communications, employee relations and benefits and human resources, information technology, investment management, legal and litigation management, policy administration, payroll processing, purchasing, real estate management, regulatory compliance, reinsurance, administration of our run-off liabilities, risk management, tax, treasury, and other services. Liberty Mutual also provides us with our information technology programs. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions. If we are not successful at operating our business under these arrangements, then it may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. We currently have, and after this offering will continue to have, contractual arrangements which require us to obtain the necessary services above from Liberty Mutual rather than providing those services ourselves or contracting with a third party. We cannot assure you that, after the completion of this offering, these services and arrangements will be sustained at the same level as when we were wholly-owned by Liberty Mutual or that we will obtain the same benefits. Under the Intercompany Agreement, Liberty Mutual has agreed not to terminate these arrangements, without cause, prior to December 31, 2010. Otherwise, Liberty Mutual generally has the right to terminate certain of these arrangements on 90 days notice or at any time after Liberty Mutual no longer owns or controls us. After the termination or expiration of these arrangements, we may not be able to replace these services and arrangements in a timely manner, on terms and conditions, including cost, as favorable as those we have received from Liberty Mutual or that are economically acceptable. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions. In addition, we have benefited from being a subsidiary of a well-financed company and a part of an insurance holding company system led by Liberty Mutual. Following this offering, while we will continue to be a subsidiary of Liberty Mutual, we may gradually lose some benefits of being part of Liberty Mutual. While Liberty Mutual does not currently intend to sell down its position in our common stock following this offering, Liberty Mutual may elect to do so in the future. Accordingly, customers, agents, rating agencies and investors will assess our strengths and weaknesses independently, and this may have a negative effect upon our ability to attract new business and raise additional capital. Service agreements and other arrangements with Liberty Mutual may not be on arms length terms. Prior to and in connection with the initial public offering, we will have entered into certain contractual arrangements with Liberty Mutual. Because these agreements were made in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship, we cannot confirm that such terms, such as the price we pay for such services, the standard of care owed by Liberty Mutual and any dispute resolution mechanisms, are as favorable to us as they might have been had we contracted with independent parties. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions. Liberty Mutuals failure to retain or hire key personnel could reduce our revenues and operational effectiveness. Prior to Liberty Mutuals transfer of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees to us on January 1, 2011, our performance substantially depends on the expertise, experience and know-how of key management personnel, all of whom are currently employees of Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual does not have fixed-term employment agreements with any of these key employees , and the loss of one or more of these key employees could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Our success therefore depends on the ability of Liberty Mutual to retain or hire key personnel. General difficulties in retaining or hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 32 Table of Contents We are highly dependent on Liberty Mutual for investment management services. We are highly dependent on Liberty Mutual in connection with the management of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolios are managed pursuant to investment management agreements and cash management agreements, all on a discretionary basis by Liberty Mutual. If we lose our investment relationship with Liberty Mutual, we may not be able to secure an investment manager or managers who will produce returns on our investments similar to those produced by Liberty Mutual in the past, or any positive returns at all. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Investment Management Agreements and Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Cash Management Agreement. Following this offering, Liberty Mutual will also manage the investment portfolios of other subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual is free, in its sole discretion, to make recommendations to others, or effect transactions on behalf of itself or others which may be the same as or different from those effected on our behalf. In addition, Liberty Mutual may, from time to time, for itself or its client cause, direct or recommend the purchase or sale of securities of the same or different class of the same issuer as securities that Liberty Mutual recommends to us. Liberty Mutual has no affirmative obligation to offer any investment to us, or to inform us of any investment opportunity, before offering such investment or opportunity to other funds or accounts that Liberty Mutual manages or advises or taking advantage of such investment opportunities for its own proprietary accounts. Liberty Mutual may recommend to other clients or for its own account, activities that would compete with or otherwise adversely affect us. Liberty Mutual is under no obligation to make consistent recommendations to, or effect similar transactions for, all or any of its clients. In the event that a determination is made that we and another client of Liberty Mutual should trade in the same investments on the same day, such investments will be allocated between us and other accounts in a manner that Liberty Mutual determines in accordance with its allocation procedures. Circumstances may occur in which an allocation could have adverse effects on us or the other client with respect to the price or size of securities positions obtainable or saleable. For a summary of our investment guidelines, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Investment Portfolio. There can be no assurance that we will receive investment opportunities of the same quality as those we might receive from an independent investment manager. Because the kinds of investment we can make are already limited to some extent by state insurance regulations, our investment options may therefore be further limited. Our ability to compete effectively with respect to certain surety products is dependent on our underwriting limitation. Our Surety segment currently offers surety products through our own insurance subsidiaries as well as through Liberty Mutual. Surety business written by Liberty Mutual on our behalf is ceded to us through an assumed reinsurance agreement with Liberty Mutual, which will be amended and restated in connection with this offering. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement. Our Surety segments ability to attract large contract business depends on our underwriting limitations. The federal Miller Act requires a contractor awarded a federal construction contract to supply a surety bond issued by a company holding a U.S. Treasury Department Certificate of Authority. Upon review of each companys financial information, the Treasury Department determines the underwriting limitation for each company. The underwriting limitation represents 10% of the companys paid-in capital and surplus less certain deductions. Pursuant to Treasury Department regulations, a company may not issue a single bond that exceeds its underwriting limitation absent co-insurance or reinsurance for the amount in excess of its underwriting limitation. A surety carrier that writes business through a company with a high underwriting limitation has a competitive advantage in the surety marketplace. A company with a high underwriting limitation can write large surety bonds on its own financial strength without the need for reinsurance or co-insurance. Agents and surety bond customers view a high underwriting limitation as a sign of financial strength and stability when assessing a potential surety relationship. As of December 31, 2009, Liberty Mutual had an underwriting limitation of over $663 million. Peerless Insurance Company is our subsidiary with the highest underwriting limitation, $157 million as of December 31, 2009. 33 Table of Contents Control of us by Liberty Mutual and the relationship to Liberty Mutual of some of our directors and officers may limit your ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval. Following the completion of this offering, Liberty Mutual will beneficially own 100% of our Class B common stock and none of our Class A common stock, representing % of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and % of our total equity ownership. The holders of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock have identical rights, preferences and privileges except with respect to voting, the election and removal of directors, conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock and certain actions that require the consent of holders of Class B common stock described under Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement and Description of Capital Stock  Approval Rights of Holders of Class B Common Stock. Holders of our Class B common stock will generally be entitled to ten votes per share of Class B common stock, and the holders of our Class A common stock will be entitled to one vote per share of Class A common stock. Until such a time as Liberty Mutual, or its successor, beneficially owns shares of our common stock representing less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding voting stock, Liberty Mutual will have the ability to take stockholder action without the vote of any other stockholder and without having to call a stockholder meeting and elect at least 80% of our directors, and investors in this offering will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote during this period. As a result, Liberty Mutual may, through our board of directors, influence all matters affecting us, including:  any determination with respect to our business plans and policies;  any determination with respect to mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;  our acquisition or disposition of assets;  our financing activities;  certain changes to our certificate of incorporation;  changes to agreements providing for our transition to becoming a public company; and  determinations with respect to enforcement of rights we may have against third parties. Under the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the Intercompany Agreement, the prior affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Class B common stock will be required in connection with various corporate actions by us until such time as Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own at least 20% of the shares of our outstanding common stock. The corporate actions requiring such prior consent include, subject to certain exceptions:  the adoption or implementation of any stockholder rights plan;  any consolidation or merger of us with any person, or entry into any other transaction or series of transactions that would otherwise result in a change of control;  any acquisition by us or any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition, other than transactions between us and our subsidiaries, or any series of related acquisitions or dispositions, involving consideration in excess of $25 million;  the issuance by us or one of our subsidiaries of any stock or stock equivalents;  the incurrence, issuance, assumption, guarantee or otherwise becoming liable for any debt, other than up to $200 million of debt in connection with a revolving credit facility;  our dissolution, liquidation or winding up;  the election, designation, appointment or removal of any of our executive officers;  the declaration of dividends on any class or series of our capital stock other than preferred stock;  any change in our authorized capital stock or our creation of any class or series of capital stock; 34 Table of Contents  any change in the number of directors on our board of directors, or filling any newly created seats or vacancies on our board of directors; or  the amendment of various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In addition, for as long as Liberty Mutual beneficially owns at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, we will be required to receive Liberty Mutuals prior consent for any action in regards to our enterprise risk profile that is inconsistent with the joint management of our enterprise risk with Liberty Mutual on a consolidated basis as directed by Liberty Mutual. If Liberty Mutual does not provide any requisite consent allowing us to take such actions when requested, we will not be able to take such actions and, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be harmed. Liberty Mutuals voting control and its additional rights described above may discourage transactions involving a change of control of us, including transactions in which you as a holder of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over the then-current market price. While Liberty Mutual currently has no intent to do so, Liberty Mutual is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party and may do so without your approval and without providing a purchase of your shares of Class A common stock. Accordingly, your shares of Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if Liberty Mutual did not maintain voting control over us or have the additional rights described above. Our ability to undertake new risks may be restricted as a result of Liberty Mutuals approval rights over changes in our enterprise risk management profile. We assess our risk taking with the goal to be within our risk appetite in order to maintain value for all of the areas of our company. This approach to company-wide risk management is commonly referred to as enterprise risk management, which we refer to in this prospectus as ERM. Our philosophy and framework goes beyond the quantification, aggregation and identification of risks (and the correlations) inherent in the business and operations of the enterprise. This philosophy also provides our management with a framework for evaluating the assumption of risk in the context of expected profit potential and capital and rating implications based on the most up-to-date market intelligence and within the confines of prescribed underwriting and risk tolerance guidelines. Our ERM incorporates operational risk, tail events, reputational and other risks. Our certificate of incorporation and the Intercompany Agreement will provide that for as long as Liberty Mutual beneficially owns at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, we are required to jointly manage our enterprise risk with Liberty Mutual (including, but not limited to, exposure to underwriting risks related to natural and other catastrophes, credit risk in our investment portfolios, insurance operations and otherwise and other risks that are of a nature subject to the oversight of Liberty Mutuals enterprise risk management committee) on a consolidated basis with and as determined by Liberty Mutual. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, and waive any claim with respect to, any business opportunity that may otherwise be available to us were enterprise risk management not so managed. As a result, our ability to undertake new risks outside the risk appetite of Liberty Mutual, including writing new lines of business and writing risks in certain geographic areas, may be restricted. See  Risks Relating to Our Relationship with Liberty Mutual  Control of us by Liberty Mutual and the relationship to Liberty Mutual of some of our directors and officers may limit your ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Enterprise Risk Management, Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering and Description of Capital Stock-Approval Rights of Holders of Class B Common Stock. 35 Table of Contents Control of us by Liberty Mutual and the relationship to Liberty Mutual of some of our directors and officers may result in conflicts of interest. Because Liberty Mutuals interests may differ from ours, actions that Liberty Mutual, as our controlling stockholder, may take with respect to us may not be favorable to us. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise between us and Liberty Mutual in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. It is expected that certain of our directors will also be directors or executive officers of Liberty Mutual or its other affiliates. These relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Liberty Mutual. These potential conflicts could arise, for example, over matters such as the desirability of an acquisition opportunity, employee retention or recruiting, or our dividend policy. To address corporate opportunities that are presented to our directors or officers that are also directors or officers of Liberty Mutual or its other affiliates and other potential conflicts of interest, we will adopt a corporate opportunity policy which will be incorporated into our certificate of incorporation. See Description of Capital Stock  Certificate of Incorporation Provisions Relating to Corporate Opportunities and Interested Directors. We cannot assure you that the provisions in our certificate of incorporation will adequately address potential conflicts of interest or that potential conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor or that we will be able to take advantage of corporate opportunities presented to individuals who are officers or directors of both us and Liberty Mutual or its other affiliates. As a result, we may be precluded from pursuing certain growth initiatives. Our certificate of incorporation will provide that Liberty Mutual and its directors will have limited liability to us for engaging in certain competitive activities. Our certificate of incorporation will provide that, subject to any contractual provision to the contrary, Liberty Mutual will not have an obligation to refrain from:  engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as we do;  doing business with any of our clients or customers; or  employing or otherwise engaging any of our officers or employees. Under our certificate of incorporation, neither Liberty Mutual nor any officer or director of Liberty Mutual, except as provided in our certificate of incorporation, will be liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of these activities. See Description of Capital Stock  Certificate of Incorporation Provisions Relating to Corporate Opportunities and Interested Directors. We are prohibited from taking certain actions that could affect Liberty Mutual. Our certificate of incorporation will provide that, without the consent of Liberty Mutual, we may not engage in any activity which would require Liberty Mutual to obtain any approval, consent or authorization of or under any law or with any regulatory agency or cause any of our directors who is also a director or officer of Liberty Mutual or its affiliates to be ineligible to serve, or prohibited from serving, as a director of Liberty Mutual or its other affiliates. As a result, if Liberty Mutual does not provide any requisite consent allowing us to take such actions when requested, we will not be able to take such actions and, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be harmed. See Description of Capital Stock  Provisions Relating to Regulatory Status. Our inability to resolve favorably any disputes that arise between us and Liberty Mutual with respect to our past and ongoing relationships may result in a significant reduction of our revenue. Disputes may arise between Liberty Mutual and us in a number of areas relating to our ongoing relationships, including:  labor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Liberty Mutual;  services to be provided to us by Liberty Mutual; 36 Table of Contents  employee retention and recruiting;  business combinations involving us;  sales or dispositions by Liberty Mutual of all or any portion of its beneficial ownership interest in us;  the nature, quality and pricing of services Liberty Mutual has agreed to provide us;  investment opportunities that may be attractive to both Liberty Mutual and us;  issues arising under the tax sharing agreement;  the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement; and  business opportunities that may be attractive to both Liberty Mutual and us. We have agreed to a dispute resolution mechanism with Liberty Mutual in several of our agreements, whereby we will attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of disputes arising between Liberty Mutual and our company without resorting to arbitration. If these efforts are not successful, the dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions. However, disputes may still arise and may not be resolved favorably for us. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. The agreements we will enter into with Liberty Mutual may be amended upon agreement between the parties. While we are controlled by Liberty Mutual, we may not have the leverage to negotiate amendments to these agreements on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party. Liberty Mutual may engage in the same type of business as us and thereby hamper our ability to successfully operate and expand our business. Liberty Mutual is not exiting the property casualty insurance business as part of the initial public offering of our company. Because Liberty Mutual may currently or in the future engage in the same activities in which we engage, there is a risk that we may be in direct competition with Liberty Mutual. While Liberty Mutual has indicated to us that their current expectation is to manage their activities such that opportunities to acquire U.S. commercial lines property and casualty businesses focused on small and mid-size businesses, personal lines businesses and surety businesses distributed through independent agents will be pursued through our company, Liberty Mutual is not legally obligated to do so and could in the future manage their activities in a different way. Moreover, Liberty Mutual is not legally obligated to refrain from soliciting or hiring any of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees (including any of our executives) following the transfer of employees and executives to us on January 1, 2011. Due to the resources of Liberty Mutual, including financial resources, name recognition and knowledge of our strengths, weaknesses and business practices, Liberty Mutual could have a significant competitive advantage over us should they decide to engage in the type of business we conduct, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Liberty Mutual could additionally assert control over us in a way that could impede our growth or our ability to enter new markets or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The historical and pro forma financial information included in this prospectus does not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a stand-alone company 37 Table of Contents during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future. This is primarily a result of the following factors:  Our historical and pro forma financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Liberty Mutual. Those allocations may be different from the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a stand-alone company;  Significant changes in our cost structure, financing and business operations have occurred as a result of the Transactions. As a result, the costs reflected in our historical consolidated and pro forma financial statements may not represent our costs in future periods with respect to economies of scale; stand-alone costs for services previously provided by Liberty Mutual; the need for additional personnel to perform services previously provided by Liberty Mutual; and the legal, accounting, compliance and other costs associated with being a public company with listed equity; see  We have no experience operating as a stand-alone company and immediately following this offering we will not have our own employees or executives until January 1, 2011 and will be solely dependent on the management, personnel and facilities of Liberty Mutual, and will thereafter remain significantly dependent on Liberty Mutual; and  Under some of our agreements with third parties, our separation from Liberty Mutual allows the other party to the agreement to terminate the agreement pursuant to a change of control provision, which may be triggered when Liberty Mutuals ownership of our company decreases to less than 50%. If the other party to any of these agreements does not wish to continue the agreement, we may be required to terminate or modify our existing agreement or seek alternative arrangements, which could result in reduced sales, increased costs or other disruptions to our business. We will be a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules, and, as a result, will rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies. After the completion of this offering, Liberty Mutual will beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and we will be a controlled company under the NYSE corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, certain exemptions under the NYSE standards free us from the obligation to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the following requirements:  that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors;  that we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities;  that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities; and  for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance committee and compensation committee. As a result of our use of the controlled company exemptions, you will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Third parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Liberty Mutual. Third parties may seek to hold us responsible for Liberty Mutual liabilities. Under our Intercompany Agreement with Liberty Mutual, Liberty Mutual will indemnify us for claims and losses relating to liabilities related to the business of Liberty Mutual and its affiliates and not related to our business. However, if those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from Liberty Mutual. 38 Table of Contents We are party to a tax sharing agreement with Liberty Mutual and will be party to the Intercompany Agreement, which further addresses tax issues. Under these agreements our tax liabilities generally are determined as if we were not part of any consolidated, combined or unitary tax group of Liberty Mutual. We nonetheless could be held liable for the tax liabilities of other members of these groups for any taxable period during which we filed consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns with such members. We have historically been included in Liberty Mutuals consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as in certain consolidated, combined or unitary groups that include Liberty Mutual and/or certain of its subsidiaries for state and local income tax purposes. We are party to a tax sharing agreement with Liberty Mutual. After this offering, we will also be party to the Intercompany Agreement, which applies the principles of the tax sharing agreement for purposes of other combined and unitary returns. Pursuant to these agreements, we and Liberty Mutual generally make or will make payments to each other such that, with respect to tax returns for any taxable period in which we or any of our subsidiaries were or are included in Liberty Mutuals consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any other consolidated, combined or unitary group of Liberty Mutual and/or its subsidiaries, the amount of taxes to be paid by us is determined, subject to certain adjustments, as if we and each of our subsidiaries included in such consolidated, combined or unitary group had filed tax returns separate from Liberty Mutual. If we generate a loss that is used by Liberty Mutual, Liberty Mutual will compensate us for that loss when it could have been carried back by us to produce a refund or carried forward by us to reduce our taxable income. We have been included in the Liberty Mutual consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes for periods in which Liberty Mutual owned at least 80% of each of the total voting power and value of our outstanding stock and expect to be included in such consolidated group following this offering. Each member of a consolidated group during any part of a consolidated return year is severally liable for tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently determined deficiency thereon. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, each member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group for state, local or foreign income tax purposes is severally liable for the state, local or foreign income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated, combined or unitary group. Accordingly, for any period in which we are included in the Liberty Mutual consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any other consolidated, combined or unitary group of Liberty Mutual and/or its subsidiaries, we could be liable in the event that any income tax liability was incurred, but not discharged, by any other member of any such group. Under the tax sharing agreement and the Intercompany Agreement, Liberty Mutual indemnifies us for any income tax liability of Liberty Mutual for which we are held liable. In addition, by virtue of its controlling ownership and the existing tax sharing agreement, Liberty Mutual controls substantially all of our tax decisions and has sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings, including tax audits relating to Liberty Mutuals consolidated or combined income tax returns in which we are included. We could be held liable for underfunded pension liabilities of Liberty Mutual. We could also be held liable for underfunded liabilities under the Liberty Mutual pension plan. Liberty Mutual sponsors a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which we refer to in this prospectus as ERISA. This pension plan covers over 35,000 active and 38,000 terminated vested and retired employees of Liberty Mutual Group, and approximately 11,000 of these active participants will be employed by us, after 2010. Under ERISA, each member of a controlled group of corporations can be jointly and severally liable under certain circumstances for these pension liabilities as well as a termination premium of $1,250 per participant for up to a three-year period following an involuntary termination by the PBGC or a distress termination by Liberty Mutual of this pension plan. Under the Intercompany Agreement, Liberty Mutual will indemnify us for any of these pension liabilities for which we might be held liable. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Agreements  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement. However, if those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we cannot assure that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from Liberty Mutual. As of the date of this prospectus, Liberty Mutuals pension plan is in compliance with ERISAs minimum funding standards and we are not aware of any current facts that would be reasonably likely to trigger any liability under ERISA to us with respect to underfunded amounts under Liberty Mutuals pension plan. As of January 1, 2010, the fair market value of assets was $3.614 billion and the estimated funding target liability of this pension plan was 39 Table of Contents $3.656 billion. Note that the funding target is not intended to represent the liabilities of the Liberty Mutual pension plan in the event of a plan termination. As of the date of this prospectus, $200 million has been contributed this year to the Liberty Mutual pension plan with respect to the 2009 tax year as permitted under the Internal Revenue Code and this amount has been included in the fair market value shown above. We will separately establish a new defined benefit pension plan for future service provided by our employees effective as of January 1, 2011. Our financial strength ratings will be dependent upon the financial strength ratings of Liberty Mutual and could be adversely affected in the event that Liberty Mutuals financial condition deteriorates. Given Liberty Mutuals significant ownership and control, we anticipate and believe that our financial strength ratings will be coupled with the financial strength ratings of Liberty Mutual. As a result, any deterioration in the financial condition of Liberty Mutual, or any other event which the rating agencies deem to negatively impact the financial strength of Liberty Mutual, could also negatively impact our financial strength ratings. We do not know the circumstances under which the rating agencies would no longer couple our financial strength ratings with Liberty Mutuals. We may not use the Liberty Mutual name under certain circumstances. We market our insurance products using a co-branding strategy under which each of our operating segment brands is identified as a member of the Liberty Mutual Group. We have the right to use certain marks containing the words Liberty Mutual and the Statue of Liberty design under a Trademark License Agreement with Liberty Mutual. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Trademark License Agreement. Liberty Mutual may terminate the Trademark License Agreement in the event it no longer beneficially owns more than 50% of the combined voting power of our common stock. Our inability to use the Liberty Mutual trademarks could adversely affect our go-to-market strategy because the strength of the Liberty Mutual trademarks cannot easily be replicated. Risks Relating to This Offering and Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock An active trading market for our Class A common stock may not develop, and you may not be able to sell your Class A common stock at or above the initial public offering price. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock. An active trading market for shares of our Class A common stock may never develop or be sustained following this offering. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling your shares of Class A common stock at an attractive price, or at all. The price for our Class A common stock in this offering will be determined by negotiations with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the underwriters, and it may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the open market following this offering. Consequently, you may not be able to sell your Class A common stock at or above the initial public offering price or at any other price or at the time that you would like to sell. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our Class A common stock, and it may impair our ability to motivate our management and employees through equity incentive awards and our ability to raise capital or acquire other companies by using our Class A common stock as consideration. Because there has not been any public market for our Class A common stock, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile. You should consider an investment in our Class A common stock to be risky and you should invest in our Class A common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. The price of our Class A common stock after the closing of this offering may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:  the perceived prospects for the insurance industry in general or for our company or Liberty Mutual;  differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors;  changes in the share price of public companies with which we compete; 40 Table of Contents  news about our industry and our competitors;  changes in our relationship with Liberty Mutual;  news about our new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;  changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or our incurrence of debt;  changes in general economic or market conditions;  broad market fluctuations;  regulatory actions or changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations;  unfavorable or lack of published research by securities or industry analysts; and  departures of key personnel. Our Class A common stock may trade at prices significantly below the initial public offering price. In addition, when the market price of a companys common equity drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources. The price of our Class A common stock may decline due to the large number of outstanding shares eligible for future sale to the public. Sales in the future of substantial amounts of our common stock that are currently beneficially owned by Liberty Mutual, or the possibility of these sales, may adversely affect the price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions. After the completion of this offering, there will be shares of our common stock outstanding. Of these shares, Liberty Mutual will beneficially own all of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing % of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. Liberty Mutual may convert any shares of Class B common stock that they own into shares of Class A common stock at any time. Also, in connection with this offering, we have granted Liberty Mutual certain registration rights to sell their remaining common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in these shares, other than shares purchased by us or our affiliates, becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to their Offering  Registration Rights Agreement. Shares of Class B common stock automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon a sale or transfer by Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual may elect to convert shares of Class B common stock that it beneficially owns into shares of Class A common stock and use such shares of Class A common stock as consideration to pay for future acquisitions by Liberty Mutual. The holding of such a large number of common stock by a single entity, and future sales of those shares (subject to the 180-day lockup that Liberty Mutual has agreed to in connection with this offering), could create an overhang effect that may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock. You may be prevented from recognizing a change of control premium on the sale of Class A common stock. Liberty Mutual currently beneficially owns all of our outstanding common stock. After completion of this offering, Liberty Mutual will beneficially own 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing % of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. For as long as Liberty Mutual owns a majority of our voting securities, a takeover of our company will require Liberty Mutuals approval. Because the Class B common stock has greater aggregate voting power than the Class A common stock, the accumulation of a significant block of Class B common stock after completion of this offering could result in a change of control without the affirmative vote of holders of Class A common stock. 41 Table of Contents In addition, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable. We plan to issue a number of options to purchase Class A common stock to our directors, executive officers and employees that could dilute your interest in us. Upon the closing of this offering, we will have shares of Class A common stock available for issuance to our directors, executive officers and employees in connection with grants of options to purchase Class A common stock under our employee benefits arrangements. Issuances of Class A common stock to our directors, executive officers and employees pursuant to the exercise of stock options under our employee benefits arrangements will dilute your interest in us. The anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions will include:  a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms;  after Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own a majority of the voting power of our common stock, elimination of the right of our stockholders to act by written consent;  rules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;  the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors or any other matters;  the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and  limitations on the right of stockholders to remove directors. We believe that these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests and that of our stockholders. See Description of Capital Stock  Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Other Intercompany Agreements. Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company. Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist where any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting stock of the domestic insurer, unless the applicable state insurance commissioner, upon application, determines otherwise. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicants board of directors and executive officers, the applicants plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be deemed to have acquired such control, if the applicable state insurance commissioner, determines that such persons, directly or indirectly, exercise a controlling influence over our management or policies. 42 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The information contained in this prospectus may contain forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or referenced in this prospectus that address activities, events or developments which we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words will, may, should, believe, intend, expect, anticipate, project, estimate, predict and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements with respect to our:  business strategy;  reinsurance coverage;  catastrophic losses;  investment performance;  financial and operating targets or plans;  investment, economic and underwriting market conditions;  incurred unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and the adequacy of our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance;  projections of revenues (including premium rates (either for new or renewal business) and premium volume), income (or loss), earnings (or loss) per share, combined ratio, dividends, market share or other financial forecasts;  expansion and growth of our business and operations; and  liquidity and future capital expenditures. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors believed to be appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with its expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, including the risks discussed beginning on page 12 of this prospectus. Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this prospectus are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, us or our business or operations. We assume no obligation to update publicly any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 43 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS Our net proceeds from this offering are estimated to be $ million, or $ million if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full, assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share (the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus). We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay a portion of two notes payable that we owe or will owe to Liberty Mutual. For a description of the interest rate and maturity of each of these notes and the amount of net proceeds to be used to repay each note, see Note (B) of notes to the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  The Transactions. 44 Table of Contents DIVIDEND POLICY Our board of directors currently intends to authorize the payment of a dividend of $ per Class A common share and Class B common share per quarter to our stockholders of record, beginning in the first quarter of 2011. Any determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our subsidiaries payment of dividends and/or other statutorily permissible payments to us, our results of operations and cash flows, our financial position and capital requirements, general business conditions, any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends, including consent rights of Liberty Mutual as holder of our Class B common stock, and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant. We are a holding company and have no direct operations. While our non-insurance subsidiaries are not subject to restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends other than those imposed by corporate law, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. Our ability to pay dividends depends primarily on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we declared and paid dividends to Liberty Mutual of $84 million, $979 million and $0, respectively. For the first three months of 2010, our insurance subsidiaries declared and paid ordinary and extraordinary dividends to Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation totaling approximately $2.471 billion. As a result of these dividends, our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay ordinary dividends for the remainder of 2010 was exhausted and the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries as of March 31, 2010 was $5.091 billion. In connection with a dividend we intend to declare to Liberty Mutual prior to the completion of this offering, we intend to seek regulatory approval for our top-tier insurance subsidiaries to make distributions in an aggregate amount of up to $ million. For more information regarding restrictions on the payment of dividends by us and our insurance subsidiaries, see Regulation, Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement  Restrictive Covenants and Description of Capital Stock  Approval Rights of Holders of Class B Common Stock. 45 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2009:  our actual cash and short-term investments and capitalization; and  our pro forma cash and short-term investments and capitalization after giving effect to this offering and the Transactions for which we have made pro forma adjustments as if they had occurred on December 31, 2009. For more information about the Transactions, see Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements. You should read the following information in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information provided under the captions Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data, Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this prospectus, as well as the historical financial statements of Safeco and Ohio Casualty that are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and are incorporated by reference herein.

The selected historical consolidated financial data presented below for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is derived from our historical financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. The selected historical consolidated financial data presented below for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is derived from our unaudited historical consolidated financial statements not included in this prospectus. These historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in any future period. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are not directly comparable. We acquired Safeco on September 22, 2008 and Ohio Casualty on August 24, 2007. Each of these acquisitions significantly increased the size of our existing business and expanded the scope of our operations. The financial results of each of these acquired businesses is only included in our consolidated results from and after the respective dates of acquisition. Non-recurring items related to these acquisitions and the Transactions also affect the comparability of our financial results. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial Information. You should read the following selected financial data in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus, as well as the historical financial statements of Safeco and Ohio Casualty that are incorporated by reference in this prospectus. 47 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions, except share data) Statement of Operations Data Net written premiums $ 10,148 $ 6,704 $ 4,407 $ 3,748 $ 3,530 Net premiums earned 9,983 6,913 4,325 3,636 3,474 Net investment income 910 719 405 308 272 Fee and other revenues 97 50 33 31 33 Net realized investment (losses) gains (53 ) (407 ) (5 )  45 Total revenues 10,937 7,275 4,758 3,975 3,824 Claims and claim adjustment expenses 6,157 4,326 2,601 2,342 2,205 General and administrative expenses 1,005 777 551 401 413 Goodwill impairment(1)  973    Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 2,392 1,664 1,056 866 808 Interest expense 4 21 6 1 1 Total claims and expenses 9,558 7,761 4,214 3,610 3,427 Income (loss) before income tax expense 1,379 (486 ) 544 365 397 Income tax expense 377 78 167 113 150 Net income (loss) $ 1,002 $ (564 ) $ 377 $ 252 $ 247 Share Data Net income (loss) per common share: Basic $ $ $ $ $ Diluted $ $ $ $ $ Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic Diluted Non-GAAP Financial Measure (2) Pre-tax operating income $ 1,455 $ 934 $ 599 $ 365 $ 352 Reconciliation to net income (loss): Net income (loss) 1,002 (564 ) 377 252 247 Less: Net realized investment (losses) gains (53 ) (407 ) (5 )  45 Add: Income tax expense 377 78 167 113 150 Add: Goodwill impairment  973    Add: Integration and other acquisition related costs 23 40 50   Pre-tax operating income $ 1,455 $ 934 $ 599 $ 365 $ 352 Combined Ratio Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio(3) 63.7 % 64.7 % 65.4 % 62.2 % 58.7 % Underwriting expense ratio(4) 31.7 33.0 35.0 34.3 34.0 Subtotal 95.4 97.7 100.4 96.5 92.7 Catastrophes(5) 4.4 5.1 2.1 4.0 3.1 Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (6.2 ) (7.2 ) (7.4 ) (1.8 ) 1.7 Combined ratio(6) 93.6 % 95.6 % 95.1 % 98.7 % 97.5 % 48 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Balance Sheet Data Cash and investments $ 22,504 $ 20,062 $ 11,313 $ 6,694 $ 6,140 Premium and other receivables, net 2,405 2,567 1,438 1,090 1,012 Goodwill 3,054 3,054 1,345 290 290 Other assets 4,423 5,250 2,543 1,570 1,557 Total assets 32,386 30,933 16,639 9,644 8,999 Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses 12,053 12,651 7,307 4,327 3,944 Unearned premiums 4,658 4,837 2,519 1,741 1,644 Long-term debt 59 82 216 10 28 Other liabilities 3,419 3,062 1,132 1,006 837 Total liabilities 20,189 20,632 11,174 7,084 6,453 Stockholders equity(7) $ 12,197 $ 10,301 $ 5,465 $ 2,560 $ 2,546 (1) Our goodwill asset at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3,054 million, largely consisting of purchase price in excess of net assets relating to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions. These acquisitions resulted in significant cost synergies and other benefits throughout Liberty Mutual Group. Liberty Mutual Group performed an impairment analysis in the third quarter of 2009 using an income-based approach. Based on that analysis, the fair market value of Liberty Mutual Groups Agency Markets business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment was necessary. However, because the legal entities that gave rise to this goodwill are part of our company, when we prepared our carve-out financial statements we were required under GAAP to record the full amount of the historical goodwill on our balance sheet and to test that goodwill for our financial statements at each of our reporting units (i.e., segments), only taking into account the synergies and benefits realized by each of our segments, without regard to synergies and benefits realized elsewhere in the Liberty Mutual Group. We conducted an impairment analysis on each of our segments on this required basis in the fourth quarter of 2008, and determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for our Personal segment exceeded its fair value, and recognized an impairment charge in our Personal segment of $973 million in 2008. However the carrying value of goodwill recorded in the consolidated financial statements of Liberty Mutual Group was unaffected. (2) We consider pre-tax operating income to be a useful supplement to net income (loss), its most comparable GAAP measure, in evaluating our financial performance. We believe that the presentation of pre-tax operating income is valuable because it assists an investor in determining the degree to which our insurance-related revenues, composed primarily of net premiums earned, net investment income and fee and other revenues, have generated operating earnings after meeting our insurance-related obligations, composed primarily of claims and claim adjustment expenses and other operating costs. (3) Calculated by dividing claims and claim adjustment expenses by net premiums earned (net of premiums earned attributable to prior years). Catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years are excluded from claims and claim adjustment expenses. (4) Calculated by dividing the sum of general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs less fee revenues by net premiums earned (net of premiums earned attributable to prior years). Integration and other acquisition related costs associated with the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, intangible amortization, and bad debt expenses have been excluded from the combined ratio. These costs are reflected within general and administrative expenses. (5) Calculated by dividing catastrophes by net premiums earned. Catastrophes include all current and prior year catastrophe losses. (6) Calculated by adding the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio, underwriting expense ratio, the catastrophes ratio, and net incurred losses attributable to prior years ratio. (7) The cumulative effect of the change in the method of accounting that resulted in an increase in the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity has been recognized in 2005 for the purpose of presenting Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data. 49 Table of Contents Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements The following pro forma consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009 and the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2010 have been derived by application of pro forma adjustments to our historical consolidated financial statements. The pro forma consolidated statements of operations give pro forma effect to this offering and the Transactions as if they had been completed as of January 1, 2009 and the pro forma consolidated balance sheet gives pro forma effect to this offering and the Transactions as if they had been completed as of March 31, 2010. The Transactions are described in more detail under Summary  Transactions with Liberty Mutual and Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  The Transactions. The pro forma consolidated financial data should also be read in conjunction with the information contained in Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. The principal changes to our historical consolidated financial statements resulting from the pro forma adjustments are as follows:  Debt. Debt will increase by approximately $ on a pro forma basis due to the issuance of a purchase note payable to Liberty Mutual in connection with Liberty Mutuals transfer of Ohio Casualty to us prior to consummation of this offering, net of repayments from the net proceeds of this offering of a portion of such note together with a portion of another note payable that we owe to Liberty Mutual;  Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity will decrease on a pro forma basis due to dividends of cash, invested assets and debt to Liberty Mutual, partially offset by an increase in stockholders equity from the issuance and sale of Class A common stock in this offering;  Investment Income. Investment income will decrease on a pro forma basis due to payments and dividends of cash and invested assets to Liberty Mutual; and  Interest Expense. Interest expense will increase on a pro forma basis due to higher average levels of outstanding debt following this offering. The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes which should be read in conjunction with these pro forma consolidated financial statements. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The pro forma consolidated financial statements are included for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the offering and the Transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor do they purport to project the results of our operations or financial condition for any future period or as of any future date. 50 Table of Contents Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 Actual Adjustments Pro forma (dollars in millions) Net premiums earned $ $ $ Net investment income (A) Fee and other revenues Net realized investment (losses) gains Total revenues Claims and claim adjustment expenses General and administrative expenses Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs Interest expense (B) Total claims and expenses Income (loss) before income tax expense Income tax expense (C) Net income (loss) $ $ $ See notes to pro forma consolidated financial statements 51 Table of Contents Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 Actual Adjustments Pro forma (dollars in millions) Net premiums earned $ 9,983 $ $ Net investment income 910 (A) Fee and other revenues 97 Net realized investment (losses) gains (53 ) Total revenues 10,937 Claims and claim adjustment expenses 6,157 General and administrative expenses 1,005 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 2,392 Interest expense 4 (B) Total claims and expenses 9,558 Income (loss) before income tax expense 1,379 Income tax expense 377 (C) Net income (loss) $ 1,002 $ $ See notes to pro forma consolidated financial statements 52 Table of Contents Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet As of March 31, 2010 Actual Adjustments Pro forma (dollars in millions) Cash and investments $ $ (D) $ Premium and other receivables, net Goodwill Other assets Total assets $ $ $ Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses $ $ $ Unearned premiums Long-term debt (E) Other liabilities Total liabilities $ $ $ Stockholders equity (F) Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ $ $ See notes to the pro forma consolidated financial statements 53 Table of Contents Notes to the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements (A) Reflects the estimated loss of investment income earned during the respective periods associated with the following payments and dividends to Liberty Mutual which would have reduced the weighted average amount of cash and invested assets held during the respective periods:  $ of cash and invested assets paid in March 2010 to settle a payable balance resulting from the termination of the reinsurance agreements between a subsidiary of ours and insurance company subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual;  $ of cash and invested assets to be paid concurrently with or prior to the consummation of this offering as partial satisfaction of two notes payable issued by us to Liberty Mutual, excluding cash proceeds from this offering used for such purpose; and  $ of cash and invested assets to be paid prior to the consummation of this offering as special dividends and $125 million of cash and invested assets paid on 2010 as consideration for entering into the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. (B) Reflects incremental interest expense during the respective periods associated with the following transactions in 2010:  issuance on February 3, 2010 of a $4.0 billion note payable due February 29, 2012 to Liberty Mutual, bearing interest at an annual rate of 0.72%. We refer to this note payable as the February 2010 Note. Prior to completion of this offering we expect to repay approximately $ of principal amount of the February 2010 Note as part of the special dividends referenced in Note A above and expect to repay an additional $ from the net proceeds of this offering. The adjustment assumes the portion of the February 2010 Note that was not repaid prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the offering was outstanding during each of the periods presented, bearing interest at an annual rate of %.  issuance of a $ purchase note payable due to Liberty Mutual in connection with Liberty Mutuals transfer of Ohio Casualty to us prior to the consummation of this offering, bearing interest at an annual rate of %. We refer to this note payable as the Ohio Casualty Note. The issuance of the Ohio Casualty Note will be reflected as a dividend in our financial statements. Prior to completion of this offering we expect to repay approximately $ of principal amount of the Ohio Casualty Note as part of the special dividends referenced in Note A above and expect to repay an additional $ from the net proceeds of this offering, which amount assumes each share of Class A common stock is sold at a price equal to the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. The adjustment assumes the portion of the Ohio Casualty Note that was not repaid prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the offering was outstanding during each of the periods presented. For each $1.00 dollar change in the actual sale price per share of Class A common stock from the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, the principal amount of the Ohio Casualty Note following completion of the offering would change by approximately $ and, consequently, our pro forma interest expense would change by approximately $ and $ for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. (C) Reflects adjustments to income tax expense due to adjustments in our results of operations described in Notes (A) and (B) above at an assumed effective tax rate of 35%.

(E) Comprised of (i) an increase in debt of $ due to the issuance of the Ohio Casualty Note prior to the consummation of this offering, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in debt of $ due to the partial repayment of the February 2010 Note and the Ohio Casualty Note from the estimated net proceeds of this offering. (F) Comprised of a decrease in stockholders equity of $ due to dividends of cash and invested assets to Liberty Mutual that will be accounted for as dividends between April 1, 2010 and consummation of this offering, partially offset by the issuance and sale of shares of Class A common stock in this offering. 54 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus or which have been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and are incorporated by reference in this prospectus. For an understanding of pro forma financial information taking into account the Transactions, please see the section entitled Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus in the sections entitled Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Overview Business We are the second largest writer of property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, and the tenth largest writer of all property and casualty insurance in the United States, in each case based on 2008 net written premiums. We offer a balanced mix of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-size businesses and individuals throughout the United States. We also provide contract and commercial surety bonds on a national basis. We conduct our business through three operating segments and a corporate segment. The following is a description of our three operating segments:  Commercial: Our Commercial segment uses our eight regional brands to offer insurance coverage for commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation, general liability and other commercial risks to small and mid-size businesses (generally fewer than 150 employees and annual insurance premiums under $150,000) and a national brand for excess casualty products.  Personal: Our Personal segment uses the Safeco Insurance brand to offer insurance coverage on a national basis for private passenger automobile, homeowners and other personal property and liability risks to individuals.  Surety: Our Surety segment offers contract and commercial surety bonds utilizing the Liberty Mutual Surety brand for large national accounts and the Liberty SuretyFirst brand for regional and individual accounts. In addition to our three operating segments, we have a fourth segment, Corporate and Other, which reflects the results of external reinsurance, inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, run-off operations (see  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves  Corporate and Other  Run-Off Operations), net realized investment gains (losses), unallocated investment income, and interest and other expenses. For a description of inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, see  Overview  Inter-Segment Revenue and Expenses. Business Trends and Conditions General Economic Conditions. During 2009 our net written premiums were impacted adversely across all operating segments by adverse economic conditions. Commercial premiums were impacted by decreasing payroll levels, which are tied to employment. Personal premiums were influenced by various factors including declines in home purchases and other unfavorable homeownership trends and fewer new automobile purchases. Surety contract bond premiums were influenced by state and federal government budget deficits which generally result in fewer government sponsored construction and public works projects. Economic conditions improved moderately during the second half of 2009 with the U.S. gross domestic product experiencing growth during the second half of the year. 55 Table of Contents Competitive Environment. The property and casualty insurance industry remains a largely fragmented industry with a few large carriers and many smaller insurers. Property and casualty insurance market conditions in our Commercial business continued to be competitive in 2009 particularly for new business premiums. This competitive environment adversely impacted commercial lines rates and retention, which has reduced underwriting margins. However, our Personal business generally continued to achieve rate increases for its products during 2009. Loss Cost Trends. Factors that affect loss cost trends in commercial and private passenger automobile underwriting include inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care and litigation of liability claims, improved automobile safety features, legislative changes and general economic conditions. Factors that affect loss costs trends in property underwriting include inflation in the cost of building materials and labor costs and demand caused by weather-related and other catastrophes. Factors that affect loss cost trends in workers compensation underwriting include inflation in the cost of medical care, litigation of liability claims and general economic conditions. Medical treatments are also at risk from changes in state-mandated fee schedules. Personal lines frequency continues to be favorable, while the increase in severity is moderate, but within our overall expectations. Commercial lines severity has remained flat, in line with recent years, while frequency has come in lower than our expectations. Potential Regulatory Changes. Historically, property and casualty carriers have not been subject to extensive federal regulation, but rather have been regulated at the individual state level. The potential for more extensive federal oversight, however, is increasing as a result of efforts to implement a National Insurance Office as well as discussions of the impact on the insurance industry of systemic risk. We believe we are well positioned to succeed under either state or federal regulation due to our history and experience with state-based regional operations and given our scale and national capabilities. Cyclicality of the Property and Casualty Insurance Industry. The property and casualty insurance business is cyclical in nature and has historically been characterized by periods of intense price competition, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Periods of intense price competition historically have alternated with periods when shortages of underwriting capacity have permitted more attractive premium levels. Any significant decrease in the premium rates we can charge for property and casualty insurance would adversely affect our results. Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial Information The financial information included in this discussion for any particular fiscal period may not be directly comparable to the information presented for other fiscal periods and may not be representative of results in future fiscal periods. Key items that affect the comparability of our financial information are as follows: Transactions. We have effected several significant transactions since December 31, 2009 and intend to effect several additional significant transactions prior to consummation of this offering. As a result of the Transactions, in future periods we expect to have higher levels of debt and interest expense and lower levels of investment income resulting from special payments and distributions to Liberty Mutual prior to and concurrently with this offering. For additional information about the Transactions and the impact they would have had on our historical financial results and financial position, see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements. Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. We intend to enter into an indemnification agreement with Liberty Mutual prior to completion of this offering under which we will pay Liberty Mutual a one-time payment of $125 million and Liberty Mutual will indemnify us for up to $500 million of adverse development in our run-off reserves in our Corporate and Other Segment. See  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Corporate and Other and Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. The payment to Liberty Mutual will result in a non-recurring charge in 2010. 56 Table of Contents Acquisitions. We acquired Safeco on September 22, 2008 and Ohio Casualty on August 24, 2007. Safeco was a publicly-traded insurance holding company that sold personal, commercial and surety products primarily through independent agents in the United States, with approximately $5.6 billion of net written premiums in 2007. Ohio Casualty was a publicly-traded insurance holding company that sold personal, commercial and specialty insurance products primarily through independent agents in the United States, with approximately $1.4 billion of net written premiums in 2006. Because the financial results of each of these acquired businesses are only included in our consolidated results from and after the date of acquisition, the results of operations for each of the fiscal periods presented below are not comparable. Historical financial information of Ohio Casualty and Safeco for periods prior to the date of acquisition have been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and are incorporated by reference in this prospectus. See Incorporation of Financial Statements by Reference. Goodwill. Our goodwill asset at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3,054 million, largely consisting of purchase price in excess of net assets relating to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions. These acquisitions resulted in significant cost synergies and other benefits throughout Liberty Mutual Group. Liberty Mutual Group performed an impairment analysis in the third quarter of 2009 using an income-based approach. Based on that analysis, the fair market value of Liberty Mutual Groups Agency Markets business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment was necessary. However, because the legal entities that gave rise to this goodwill are part of our company, when we prepared our carve-out financial statements we were required under GAAP to record the full amount of the historical goodwill on our balance sheet and to test that goodwill for our financial statements at each of our reporting units (i.e., segments), only taking into account the synergies and benefits realized by each of our segments, without regard to synergies and benefits realized elsewhere in the Liberty Mutual Group. We conducted an impairment analysis on each of our segments on this required basis in the fourth quarter of 2008, and determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for our Personal segment exceeded its fair value, and recognized an impairment charge in our Personal segment of $973 million in 2008. However, the carrying value of goodwill recorded in the consolidated financial statements of Liberty Mutual Group was unaffected. Revenues and Expenses The major components of our revenues are net premiums earned, net investment income, fee and other revenues and net realized investment gains (losses). Net Premiums Earned. Premiums earned on insurance policies are generally reported as earned income on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the respective policies as coverage is provided. For insurance policies with variable premiums, premium estimates are reviewed and updated periodically, with resulting adjustments reflected in current operating results. Net Investment Income. Net investment income includes interest, dividends and other earnings derived from our cash and invested assets minus the expenses associated with these investments. Fee and Other Revenues. Fee and other revenues are primarily comprised of premium installment fees and other miscellaneous revenues from involuntary assigned risk pools that are earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the related policies. Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses). Net realized investment gains (losses) include gains and losses on sales of investments recognized in income using the specific identification method. Included in net realized investment gains (losses) are other-than-temporary impairment losses on our invested assets. Net realized investment gains (losses) exclude losses on investments accounted for using the equity method. The major components of operating expenses are claims and claim adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and interest expense. Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses. Claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the total loss sustained by us, whether paid or unpaid. Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent managements best estimate of the ultimate cost of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims 57 Table of Contents that have been reported but not yet paid and the cost of claims not yet reported. Also included are the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees. General and Administrative Expenses. We include the following expenses, net of any portion associated with claims, within general and administrative expenses: expenses associated with the various services agreements with Liberty Mutual and its affiliates, intangible amortization, bad debt expenses, as well as other expenses associated with our insurance operations. Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs. Costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new insurance policies are deferred and amortized over the respective policy terms to the extent recoverable. Deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions, underwriting expenses and premium taxes and are amortized in proportion to the recognition of earned premiums. Interest Expense. Interest expense represents interest associated with our outstanding debt. Inter-Segment Revenue and Expenses Allocation of Investment Income. We allocate a notional investment account and the related net investment income to our business segments. The notional investment account is equal to the beginning of year insurance liabilities for the segments plus capital allocated to the segments. Cash flow from operations during the year adds to the balance. We develop a benchmark investment yield that reflects the average planned total return on our investment portfolio and apply the benchmark investment yields to each business segments notional investment account as of the beginning of each year plus current year operating cash flows to produce total investment income by business segment. The difference between our actual net investment income and the allocated business segment investment income is reported in our Corporate and Other business segment along with all realized investment gains and losses. Inter-Segment Reinsurance Arrangements. We reinsure risks with external reinsurers on a company-wide basis through our Corporate and Other segment, which permits us to leverage our scale and diversification to maximize the efficiency of our external reinsurance purchases, and obtain more favorable terms than could any individual segment. We use inter-segment reinsurance arrangements as a tool to provide our Commercial and Personal segments the flexibility to retain the risks and benefits they believe are appropriate given the size and scope of their segment operations. The terms of our inter-segment reinsurance arrangements are finalized during our annual planning process in advance of their effective date and are reflected in the operating results of our segments on a basis that is consistent with external reinsurance. We believe that the pricing of our inter-segment reinsurance arrangements reflected in our results is consistent with market pricing. The use of inter-segment reinsurance arrangements has no effect on our consolidated results of operations or on our statutory financial statements. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure Certain tables and related disclosures in this prospectus refer to pre-tax operating income as a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure provides useful information to investors in evaluating our financial performance or condition. In addition, our management and board of directors use this measure to gauge the performance of our operations and for business planning purposes. In the following paragraphs, we provide a definition of this non-GAAP measure and explain our use of the measure and why we believe investors will find it useful. Pre-Tax Operating Income. Pre-tax operating income is a non-GAAP measure of our performance. We define pre-tax operating income as income (loss) before income tax expense excluding net realized investment gains (losses) and items that our management believes are not directly connected to the management of the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. We consider pre-tax operating income to be an appropriate indicator of underwriting and operating results and a significant metric we utilize internally to evaluate performance. For a reconciliation of pre-tax operating income to net income (loss), see our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 and for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. 58 Table of Contents Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to pre-tax operating income. Net income (loss) for any period presents the results of our insurance operations, as well as our net realized investment gains (losses), integration and other acquisition related costs, and the adjustment to our goodwill asset that occurred in 2008. We believe investors will find it useful to review the results of our insurance operations as reflected in our pre-tax operating income because it will assist an investor in determining whether our insurance-related revenues, comprised primarily of net premiums earned, net investment income and fee and other revenues, have generated operating earnings after meeting our insurance-related obligations, comprised primarily of claims and claim adjustment expenses, other operating expenses and interest expense. Pre-tax operating income is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments made to derive pre-tax operating income are important to understand our overall results from operations. Net realized investment gains (losses) and integration and other acquisition related costs occur in the periods presented. We believe the adjustments are appropriate because net realized investment gains (losses) are significantly impacted by both discretionary and economic factors which may not be indicative of future performance and the timing and amount of integration and other acquisition related costs are not connected to our management of the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Consolidated Overview  Year Ended December 31, 2009 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net Written Premiums The table below sets forth net written premiums by segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Commercial $ 4,590 $ 3,975 $ 615 15.5 % Personal 4,689 2,122 2,567 121.0 Surety 707 479 228 47.6 Corporate and Other 162 128 34 26.6 Total net written premiums $ 10,148 $ 6,704 $ 3,444 51.4 % Net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $10.148 billion, an increase of $3.444 billion, or 51.4%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase reflected $3.640 billion of net written premiums acquired through Safeco and modest premium rate increases. Excluding the effects of the Safeco acquisition in 2008, consolidated net written premiums in 2009 decreased $196 million, or 3.6%, from 2008. The decline was primarily driven by lower retention of policyholders compared to 2008 due to a more competitive environment and reduced exposures due to economic conditions. 59 Table of Contents Results of Operations The table below sets forth consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Revenues Net premiums earned $ 9,983 $ 6,913 $ 3,070 44.4 % Net investment income 910 719 191 26.6 Fee and other revenues 97 50 47 94.0 Net realized investment losses (53 ) (407 ) 354 (87.0 ) Total revenues 10,937 7,275 3,662 50.3 Claims and expenses Claims and claim adjustment expenses 6,157 4,326 1,831 42.3 General and administrative expenses 1,005 777 228 29.3 Goodwill impairment  973 (973 ) (100.0 ) Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 2,392 1,664 728 43.8 Interest expense 4 21 (17 ) (81.0 ) Total claims and expenses 9,558 7,761 1,797 23.2 Income (loss) before income tax expense 1,379 (486 ) 1,865 * Income tax expense 377 78 299 * Net income (loss) $ 1,002 $ (564 ) $ 1,566 * Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Net income (loss) $ 1,002 $ (564 ) $ 1,566 * Less: Net realized investment losses (53 ) (407 ) 354 (87.0 ) Add: Income tax expense 377 78 299 * Add: Goodwill impairment  973 (973 ) (100.0 ) Add: Integration and other acquisition related costs 23 40 (17 ) (42.5 ) Pre-tax operating income $ 1,455 $ 934 $ 521 55.8 % * Not meaningful. Revenues Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $10.937 billion, an increase of $3.662 billion, or 50.3%, over the year ended December 31, 2008 driven by increased net premiums earned, increased net investment income, increased fee and other revenues, and lower net realized investment losses. Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $9.983 billion, an increase of $3.070 billion, or 44.4%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 reflected $3.739 billion of premium related to the Safeco acquisition, which was partially offset by a decrease in audit premium (premium increases or decreases associated with variations in the underlying insured exposure (such as payroll or sales)) in commercial lines and the decrease in our net written premiums excluding the effects of the Safeco acquisition previously discussed. See  Commercial  Results of Operations  Revenues  Net Premiums Earned. 60 Table of Contents Net premiums earned in 2009 were further reduced by a $450 million increase of ceded premium related to our Homeowners Quota Share Treaty, which was effective December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. For a description of this treaty, see  Reinsurance Protection and Catastrophe Management. Pursuant to the terms of the treaty, which we refer to as the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty, we ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers 31.7% of the net premiums earned on our homeowners line, subject to certain exclusions contained in the treaty. In turn, the reinsurers accepted 31.7% of our net liability for losses occurring during the effective period of the treaty, subject to certain loss occurrence and aggregate limits contained in the treaty. Any recoveries under the treaty are allocated between Liberty Mutual, which also ceded a quota share of its homeowners business, and us in the same ratio that each partys losses bear to the total ceded losses under the treaty. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $910 million, an increase of $191 million, or 26.6%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net investment income in 2009 reflected higher fixed maturities income of $281 million due to the increase in fixed maturity securities relating to the Safeco acquisition, the sale of equity securities during 2008 that were reinvested in fixed maturities, and the continued investment of cash flows from operations. Partially offsetting these items were a decrease in limited partnership income of $28 million reflecting reduced market valuations, a decrease in dividend income of $17 million due to the reduction in our equity portfolio in light of our decision to reduce exposure to the equity markets, and higher investment expenses of $34 million due to the Safeco acquisition, additional management fees, and variable compensation costs. Our average investment yield was 4.67% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 4.87% for the year ended December 31, 2008. See  Investment Portfolio  Investment Returns. Fee and Other Revenues . Fee and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $97 million, an increase of $47 million, or 94.0%, over the year ended December 31, 2008 driven primarily by the additional fee revenues generated by the acquired Safeco personal lines business, partially offset by a decline in fee revenues from the Commercial segments servicing of policyholders in state mandated pools due to lower premium volume. Net Realized Investment Losses . Net realized investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $53 million, a decrease of $354 million, or 87.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of a $243 million increase in investment gains on sales of our fixed maturities and equity securities and a $107 million decline in impairment losses compared to 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reduced our exposure to the equity markets (with a large portion of the sales in 2008 relating to the acquired Safeco equity securities), which contributed to the overall decline in the average preferred and common stock investment balances compared to 2008. See  Investment Portfolio for details regarding other-than-temporary impairments. Claims and expenses Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses . Claims and claim adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $6.157 billion, an increase of $1.831 billion, or 42.3%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 primarily reflected the impact of the Safeco acquisition net of efficiencies achieved through integration, a $95 million increase in the amount of catastrophe losses, partially offset by an increase of $121 million in the amount of favorable prior year loss development, which we refer to in this prospectus as incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, 2009 benefited from favorable frequency and severity trends across many of our property product lines (excluding catastrophes) and favorable loss trends within personal automobile liability as compared to the prior year. Catastrophe losses in 2009 totaled $445 million compared to $350 million in 2008. The increase of $95 million reflected an increase in covered exposures as a result of the Safeco acquisition. Catastrophe losses in 2009 were concentrated in our Commercial and Personal segments driven, in large part, by several wind and hail storms in the Midwest and winter storms in the Northwest and Northeast regions of the United States. Additionally, catastrophe losses included $50 million of prior year catastrophe losses that emerged in 2009 61 Table of Contents primarily driven by Hurricane Ike in September 2008 and two Pacific Northwest winter storms that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. Each of our segments experienced favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 totaling $618 million, with 85% of the favorable emergence concentrated in our Commercial and Personal segments. Our Commercial segment experienced $314 million in favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years which were driven by actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected and lower than expected severity trends within the commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines. Our Commercial segment also reflected significant favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in the general liability product line, driven by several factors, including moderate severity and favorable frequency trends. Favorable emergence of $211 million for our Personal segment in 2009 was primarily due to favorable trends in private passenger automobile bodily injury claims, with improved estimates driven, in large part, by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends across multiple accident years. General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $1.005 billion, an increase of $228 million, or 29.3%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily driven by growth in business volume related to the Safeco acquisition net of efficiencies achieved through integration, additional intangible asset amortization of $28 million and additional management fees, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in integration and other acquisition related costs associated with the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions. Goodwill Impairment . In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized an impairment charge of $973 million in our Personal segment as previously discussed. See  Overview  Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial Information  Goodwill. Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs . The amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $2.392 billion, an increase of $728 million, or 43.8%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The growth in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in 2009 was primarily due to growth in business volume related to the Safeco acquisition, consistent with the increase in net premiums earned. Interest Expense . Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $4 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 81.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease primarily reflected a higher average level of debt outstanding during 2008 related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, which is described in more detail in the  Liquidity and Capital Resources section herein. Income Tax Expense . Federal, state, and foreign income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $377 million, an increase of $299 million over the year ended December 31, 2008. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was 27.3% compared to (16.0%) for 2008. Our effective tax rate for each of the years differed from the Federal statutory rate of 35% due in part to investment items such as tax exempt investment income on municipal bonds, and dividend received deductions for dividends from domestic stocks. The 2008 effective tax rate was further impacted by revisions to estimates and the goodwill impairment described above, which was not deductible for tax purposes. Net income (loss) Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.002 billion as compared with a net loss of $564 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $1.566 billion. Net loss in 2008 was adversely impacted by the impairment to our goodwill asset of $973 million and $407 million of realized investment losses. The increase in 2009 was impacted by favorable underwriting results discussed in more detail above. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.455 billion, an increase of $521 million, or 55.8%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in pre-tax operating income was attributable to operating earnings and cost efficiencies associated with the Safeco acquisition, underwriting 62 Table of Contents results driven by favorable frequency and severity trends across most property lines (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe) as well as the private passenger automobile liability product line. Combined Ratio The following table sets forth our consolidated combined ratios for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended Change in December 31, Percentage 2009 2008 Points Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio(1) 63.7 % 64.7 % (1.0 ) Underwriting expense ratio(2) 31.7 33.0 (1.3 ) Subtotal 95.4 97.7 (2.3 ) Catastrophes(3) 4.4 5.1 (0.7 ) Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (6.2 ) (7.2 ) 1.0 Combined ratio(4) 93.6 % 95.6 % (2.0 ) (1) Calculated by dividing claims and claim adjustment expenses by net premiums earned (net of premiums earned attributable to prior years). Catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years are excluded from claims and claim adjustment expenses. (2) The underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs less fee revenues by net premiums earned (net of premiums earned attributable to prior years). Integration and other acquisition related costs associated with the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, intangible amortization, and bad debt expenses have been excluded from the combined ratio. These costs are reflected within general and administrative expenses. (3) Calculated by dividing catastrophes by net premiums earned. Catastrophes include all current and prior year catastrophe losses. (4) Calculated by adding the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio, underwriting expense ratio, catastrophes ratio, and net incurred losses attributable to prior years ratio. Our combined ratio before catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 95.4%, a decrease of 2.3 points from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio was primarily driven by favorable loss cost trends across both the personal property and liability product lines, as well as favorable commercial property results. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio reflected the impact of writing more personal lines business, which typically has a lower expense ratio and increased efficiencies resulting from the Safeco acquisition, partially offset by additional management fees. Including the impact of catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years, the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 93.6%, a decrease of 2.0 points from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease reflected the changes in the combined ratio previously discussed and lower catastrophe losses due to favorable frequency and severity, partially offset by a decrease in the amount of favorable incurred loss attributable to prior years in 2009 as compared to 2008. 63 Table of Contents Commercial Net Written Premiums The following table sets forth net written premiums by product line for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Commercial multiple peril $ 1,825 $ 1,531 $ 294 19.2 % Commercial automobile 1,118 923 195 21.1 Workers compensation 880 886 (6 ) (0.7 ) General liability 479 380 99 26.1 Other(1) 288 255 33 12.9 Total net written premiums $ 4,590 $ 3,975 $ 615 15.5 % (1) Other net written premiums consist primarily of inland marine, farmowners multiple peril, allied lines, and fire. Commercial Multiple Peril. Commercial multiple peril net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $294 million, or 19.2%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflected $372 million of premium related to the Safeco acquisition (i.e., the amount by which Safecos contribution to our net written premiums in 2009 exceeded its contribution in 2008). Excluding the effects of the acquisition, commercial multiple peril net written premiums decreased $78 million, or 5.6%, reflecting lower retention due to competitive market conditions and adverse economic conditions. This was partially offset by modest premium rate increases and favorable new business levels in 2009. Commercial Automobile. Commercial automobile net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $195 million, or 21.1%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflected $200 million of premium related to the Safeco acquisition. Excluding the effects of the acquisition, commercial automobile net written premiums decreased $5 million, or 0.6%, due to lower retention due to competitive market conditions, partially offset by favorable new business levels. Workers Compensation. Workers compensation net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $6 million, or 0.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2008, with the Safeco acquisition adding $54 million of premium to our results in 2009. Excluding the effects of the acquisition, workers compensation net written premiums declined $60 million, or 7.0%, due to lower retention rates, decline in new business levels due to the competitive environment, our discontinuance of writing workers compensation business on a direct basis in our Commercial segments Liberty Northwest geographic region, and reduced exposures due to adverse economic conditions. General Liability. General liability net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $99 million, or 26.1%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflected an increase of $128 million of premium related to the Safeco acquisition. Excluding the effects of the acquisition, general liability net written premiums decreased by $29 million, or 8.3%, reflecting a reduction in retention due to competitive market conditions, partially offset by modest premium rate increases. Other. Other net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $33 million, or 12.9%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflected an increase of $50 million of premium related to the Safeco acquisition. Excluding the effects of the acquisition, other net written premiums decreased $17 million, or 7.9%, reflecting a reduction in new business levels and retention due to competitive market conditions. 64 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the results of operations for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Revenues Net premiums earned $ 4,606 $ 4,024 $ 582 14.5 % Net investment income 458 402 56 13.9 Fee and other revenues 34 30 4 13.3 Total revenues 5,098 4,456 642 14.4 Total claims and expenses (1) 4,577 3,843 734 19.1 Pre-tax operating income $ 521 $ 613 $ (92 ) (15.0 )% (1) Integration and other acquisition related costs associated with the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions of $11 million in 2009 and $19 million in 2008 have been excluded from total claims and expenses. Revenues Revenues for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $5.098 billion, an increase of $642 million, or 14.4%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $4.606 billion, an increase of $582 million, or 14.5%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 reflected $881 million of premiums related to the Safeco acquisition, partially offset by negative audit premiums and lower net premiums earned associated with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed. Some of our policies provide for premium adjustments based on our audit of our policyholders books and records after the policy coverage period. When premium determined after the audit is complete is less than our estimate, it results in a negative audit premium. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $458 million, an increase of $56 million, or 13.9%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 reflected additional invested assets assumed as a result of the Safeco acquisition and continued investment of cash flow from operations, partially offset by lower benchmark investment yields. Fee and Other Revenues . Fee and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $34 million, an increase of $4 million, or 13.3%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 was primarily driven by the additional installment fee revenues generated through the addition of the Safeco business, partially offset by a decline in revenues from involuntary market servicing carrier operations due to lower involuntary market premium volume. Claims and expenses Claims and expenses for our Commercial segment during the year ended December 31, 2009 were $4.577 billion, an increase of $734 million, or 19.1%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the Safeco acquisition net of efficiencies achieved through integration, a $136 million decrease in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 compared to 2008, higher catastrophe losses of $38 million and additional management fees. These items were partially offset by favorable property frequency across our commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines and lower costs of $34 million associated with third-party claims adjusters driven by higher usage in 2008, primarily related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. 65 Table of Contents Catastrophe losses included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2009 totaled $208 million compared to $170 million in 2008. The increase of $38 million reflected several wind and hail storms in the Midwest and winter storms in the Northwest and Northeast regions of the United States. Additionally, 2009 catastrophe losses included $36 million of prior year catastrophe losses that emerged in 2009, primarily driven by Hurricane Ike and two Pacific Northwest winter storms that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. Favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years of $314 million in 2009 were primarily driven by actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected and moderate severity trends within the commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines. Additionally, favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in the general liability product line were driven by several factors, including moderate severity and favorable frequency trends. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $521 million, a decrease of $92 million, or 15.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily driven by a $136 million decrease in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 as compared to 2008, higher catastrophe losses of $38 million and additional management fees. These items were partially offset by favorable frequency across most property lines and operating earnings and efficiencies gained from the Safeco acquisition. Combined Ratio The following table sets forth the combined ratio for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended Change in December 31, Percentage 2009 2008 Points Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio 65.4 % 66.3 % (0.9 ) Underwriting expense ratio 34.8 34.8  Subtotal 100.2 101.1 (0.9 ) Catastrophes 4.5 4.2 0.3 Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (6.8 ) (11.2 ) 4.4 Combined ratio 97.9 % 94.1 % 3.8 The Commercial segment combined ratio before catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 100.2%, a decrease of 0.9 points from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio was primarily due to favorable frequency across most property lines (as compared to the prior year) and lower costs associated with third-party claims adjusters. The underwriting expense ratio remained unchanged from the year ended December 31, 2008. The lower costs associated with acquired Safeco business and efficiencies gained from the Safeco acquisition were offset by additional management fees. Additionally, both the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio benefited modestly from premium rate increases. Including the impact of catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years, the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 97.9%, an increase of 3.8 points over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the year primarily reflected a decrease in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 as compared to 2008, partially offset by the changes in the combined ratio previously discussed. 66 Table of Contents Personal Net Written Premiums The following table sets forth net written premiums by product line for our Personal segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Private passenger automobile $ 3,134 $ 1,500 $ 1,634 108.9 % Homeowners 1,164 472 692 146.6 Other(1) 391 150 241 160.7 Total net written premiums $ 4,689 $ 2,122 $ 2,567 121.0 % (1) Other net written premiums consist primarily of fire, allied lines, general liability and inland marine. Private Passenger Automobile. Private passenger automobile net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $1.634 billion, or 108.9%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflected an increase of $1.591 billion of premium related to the Safeco acquisition. Excluding the effects of the acquisition, private passenger automobile net written premiums increased $43 million, or 5.0%, primarily due to rate increases in 2009. This was partially offset by a decline in new business levels and lower retention due to competitive market conditions. Homeowners. Homeowners net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $692 million, or 146.6%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflected an increase of $650 million of premium related to the Safeco acquisition.

Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $4.458 billion, an increase of $2.181 billion, or 95.8%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 reflected $2.469 billion related to the Safeco acquisition and the net premiums earned associated with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed. The net premiums earned in 2009 were also impacted by the cession of $450 million of premiums associated with the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $246 million, an increase of $115 million, or 87.8%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 reflected earnings from a larger average invested asset base as a result of the Safeco acquisition and continued investment of cash flow from operations, partially offset by lower benchmark investment yields. Fee and Other Revenues . Fee and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $62 million, an increase of $42 million over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 primarily reflected additional installment fees generated by the acquired Safeco business. Claims and expenses Claims and expenses for our Personal segment during the year ended December 31, 2009 were $4.337 billion, an increase of $1.995 billion, or 85.2%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 primarily reflected the impact of the Safeco acquisition net of efficiencies achieved through integration, higher catastrophe losses of $113 million, additional intangible asset amortization of $23 million and additional management fees, partially offset by an increase of $168 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 compared to 2008. Claims and expenses in 2009 benefited further from improved current year loss trends across most property lines and the private passenger automobile liability line, lower costs of $60 million associated with third-party claims adjusters driven by higher usage in 2008 primarily related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav and ceded losses and expenses of $416 million in connection with the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty. Catastrophe losses included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2009 totaled $236 million compared to $123 million in 2008. The increase of $113 million reflected an increase in covered exposures as a result of the Safeco acquisition. Catastrophe losses in 2009 were driven by several wind and hail storms in the Midwest and winter storms in the Northwest and Northeast regions of the United States. Additionally, 2009 catastrophe losses included $14 million of prior year catastrophe losses that emerged in 2009, primarily driven by Hurricane Ike in September 2008 and two Pacific Northwest winter storms that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. Favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years of $211 million in 2009 were primarily driven by favorable trends in personal automobile bodily injury claims. The improved estimates were driven, in large part, by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends across multiple accident years. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for our Personal segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $429 million, an increase of $343 million over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 reflected operating earnings and efficiencies gained from the Safeco acquisition, improved current year loss trends within the private passenger automobile and homeowners product lines as compared to the prior year, an increase of $168 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 68 Table of Contents compared to 2008 in the private passenger automobile liability line of business, and lower costs of $60 million associated with third-party claim adjusters due to higher usage in 2008 related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. Combined Ratio The following table sets forth the combined ratio for our Personal segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended Change in December 31, Percentage 2009 2008 Points Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio 67.1 % 68.9 % (1.8 ) Underwriting expense ratio 27.1 28.7 (1.6 ) Subtotal 94.2 97.6 (3.4 ) Catastrophes 5.3 5.4 (0.1 ) Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (4.7 ) (1.9 ) (2.8 ) Combined ratio 94.8 % 101.1 % (6.3 ) The Personal segment combined ratio before catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 94.2%, a decrease of 3.4 points from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio reflected favorable loss trends across most property lines and the private passenger automobile liability line compared to the prior year, as well as lower costs associated with third-party claims adjusters. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily due to lower costs and scale benefits associated with the acquired Safeco business, which made up a higher portion of the overall book in 2009 relative to 2008, partially offset by additional management fees. Additionally, both the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio and underwriting expense ratio were favorably impacted by rate increases. Including the impact of catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years, the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 94.8%, a decrease of 6.3 points from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease primarily reflected the changes in the combined ratio previously discussed and favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in the private passenger automobile liability line due to better than expected loss trends.

Revenues Revenues for our Surety segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $801 million, an increase of $286 million, or 55.5%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $753 million, an increase of $275 million, or 57.5%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 largely reflected $301 million of premium related to the Safeco acquisition as well as the net premiums earned associated with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $47 million, an increase of $10 million, or 27.0%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 reflected additional invested assets assumed as a result of the Safeco acquisition and continued investment of operating cash flow from operations, partially offset by lower benchmark investment yields. Claims and expenses Claims and expenses for our Surety segment during the year ended December 31, 2009 were $549 million, an increase of $190 million, or 52.9%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the Safeco acquisition net of efficiencies gained through integration and increased third-party claims adjuster costs of $9 million related to outside consulting. These items were partially offset 70 Table of Contents by an increase of $32 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 compared to 2008. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for our Surety segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $252 million, an increase of $96 million, or 61.5%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily driven by operating earnings and efficiencies gained from the Safeco acquisition and an increase of $32 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 compared to 2008. These items were partially offset by increased third-party claims adjuster costs of $9 million related to outside consulting. Combined Ratio The following table sets forth the combined ratio for our Surety segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended Change in December 31, Percentage 2009 2008 Points Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio 33.7 % 32.3 % 1.4 Underwriting expense ratio 45.2 46.2 (1.0 ) Subtotal 78.9 78.5 0.4 Catastrophes    Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (6.6 ) (3.8 ) (2.8 ) Combined ratio 72.3 % 74.7 % (2.4 ) The Surety segment combined ratio before catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 78.9%, an increase of 0.4 points over the year ended December 31, 2008. The claims and claim adjustment expense ratio increased 1.4 points reflecting adverse economic conditions, while the underwriting expense ratio declined 1.0 points from 2008, primarily due to efficiencies gained from the Safeco acquisition. Including the impact of net incurred losses attributable to prior years, the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 72.3%, a decrease of 2.4 points from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years, partially offset by the changes in the combined ratio previously discussed. Corporate and Other Net Written Premiums The following table sets forth the net written premiums for our Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Assumed inter-segment reinsurance arrangements $ 236 $ 207 $ 29 14.0 % External ceded reinsurance (74 ) (79 ) 5 (6.3 ) Total net written premiums $ 162 $ 128 $ 34 26.6 % Net written premiums for our Corporate and Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $162 million and $128 million, respectively, representing an increase of $34 million, or 26.6%. The increase reflected additional premium relating to our inter-segment reinsurance arrangements of $29 million 71 Table of Contents driven in large part by increased exposures associated with the Safeco acquisition, partially offset by increased segment retention levels. The remaining increase was attributable to a reduction of external reinsurance premium ceded of $5 million due to higher retentions, largely associated with property catastrophe coverage provided by Liberty Mutual. Inter-Segment Reinsurance Arrangements We use inter-segment reinsurance arrangements as a tool to provide our Commercial and Personal operating segments the flexibility to retain the risks and benefits they believe are appropriate given the size and scope of their segment operations. The table below reflects written premiums assumed (ceded) under the inter-segment reinsurance arrangements: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Commercial $ (173 ) $ (163 ) $ (10 ) 6.1 % Personal (63 ) (44 ) (19 ) 43.2 Corporate and Other 236 207 29 14.0 Total net written premiums $  $  $   % Results of Operations The following table sets forth the results of operations for our Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Revenues Net premiums earned $ 166 $ 134 $ 32 23.9 % Net investment income(1) 159 149 10 6.7 Net realized investment losses (53 ) (407 ) 354 (87.0 ) Total revenues 272 (124 ) 396 * Total claims and expenses 67 172 (105 ) (61.0 ) Interest expense 4 21 (17 ) (81.0 ) Income (loss) before income tax expense 201 (317 ) 518 (163.4 ) Pre-tax operating income(2) $ 253 $ 79 $ 174 * (1) The difference between our actual net investment income and the allocated business segment investment income is reported in Corporate and Other.

Revenues Revenues for our Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $272 million, an increase of $396 million over the year ended December 31, 2008. 72 Table of Contents Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $166 million, an increase of $32 million, or 23.9% over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 was primarily driven by the net premiums earned associated with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $159 million, an increase of $10 million, or 6.7%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 was primarily related to a higher invested asset base associated with an increased block of run-off reserves acquired through the Safeco acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in the difference between actual net investment income and allocated net investment income in 2009 compared to 2008. Net Realized Investment Losses . Net realized investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $53 million, a decrease of $354 million, or 87.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of a $243 million increase in investment gains on sales of our fixed maturities and equity securities and a $107 million decline in impairment losses compared to 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reduced our exposure to the equity markets (with a large portion of the sales in 2008 relating to the acquired Safeco equity securities), which contributed to the overall decline in the average preferred and common stock investment balances compared to 2008. See  Investment Portfolio for details regarding other-than-temporary impairments. Claims and expenses Claims and expenses for our Corporate and Other segment during the year ended December 31, 2009 were $67 million, a decrease of $105 million, or 61.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily reflected favorable loss experience associated with our inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, largely due to significant catastrophe activity that occurred in 2008 (including Hurricanes Ike and Gustav). An additional driver of the decrease was an increase of $57 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 compared to 2008 in both our run-off operations and external reinsurance programs. For a description of our run-off operations, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense Reserves  Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Corporate and Other  Run-Off Operations. These items were partially offset by a decrease in the amount of loss recoveries relating to our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage provided by Liberty Mutual, due to the relative absence of severe catastrophe losses in 2009. Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $4 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 81.0%, over the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease primarily reflected a higher average level of debt outstanding during 2008 related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, which is described in more detail in  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for our Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $253 million, an increase of $174 million over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to favorable loss experience associated with our inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, largely due to significant catastrophe activity that occurred in 2008 (including Hurricanes Ike and Gustav), an increase in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2009 compared to 2008 in both our run-off operations and external reinsurance programs, an increase in net premiums earned consistent with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed, and lower interest expense. These items were partially offset by a decrease in the amount of loss recoveries relating to our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage provided by Liberty Mutual, due to the relative absence of severe catastrophe losses in 2009. 73 Table of Contents Consolidated Overview  Year Ended December 31, 2008 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net Written Premiums The table below sets forth net written premiums by segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Commercial $ 3,975 $ 3,039 $ 936 30.8 % Personal 2,122 948 1,174 123.8 Surety 479 312 167 53.5 Corporate and Other 128 108 20 18.5 Total net written premiums $ 6,704 $ 4,407 $ 2,297 52.1 % Net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $6.704 billion, an increase of $2.297 billion, or 52.1%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase reflected the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, $925 million and $1.254 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions consolidated net written premiums in 2008 increased $118 million, or 3.0%, over 2007. The increase over 2007 was primarily attributable to increased levels of new business, predominantly in our Personal segment, partially offset by $224 million of premiums ceded related to the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty and modest decreases in retention for both personal and commercial product lines. 74 Table of Contents Results of Operations The table below sets forth consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Revenues Net premiums earned $ 6,913 $ 4,325 $ 2,588 59.8 % Net investment income 719 405 314 77.5 Fee and other revenues 50 33 17 51.5 Net realized investment losses (407 ) (5 ) (402 ) * Total revenues $ 7,275 4,758 2,517 52.9 Claims and expenses Claims and claim adjustment expenses 4,326 2,601 1,725 66.3 General and administrative expenses 777 551 226 41.0 Goodwill impairment 973  973 * Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 1,664 1,056 608 57.6 Interest expense 21 6 15 * Total claims and expenses $ 7,761 4,214 3,547 84.2 Income (loss) before income tax expense (486 ) 544 (1,030 ) (189.3 ) Income tax expense 78 167 (89 ) (53.3 ) Net income (loss) $ (564 ) $ 377 $ (941 ) * Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Net income $ (564 ) $ 377 $ (941 ) * Less: Net realized investment losses (407 ) (5 ) (402 ) * Add: Income tax expense 78 167 (89 ) (53.3 ) Add: Goodwill impairment 973  973 * Add: Integration and other acquisition related costs 40 50 (10 ) (20.0 ) Pre-tax operating income $ 934 $ 599 $ 335 55.9 % * Not meaningful Revenues Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $7.275 billion, an increase of $2.517 billion, or 52.9%, over the year ended December 31, 2007, driven by increased net premiums earned and net investment income, partially offset by higher net realized investment losses. Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $6.913 billion, an increase of $2.588 billion, or 59.8%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 reflected $888 million of premium related to the Ohio Casualty acquisition, $1.206 billion of premium related to the Safeco acquisition and the net premiums earned associated with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $719 million, an increase of $314 million, or 77.5%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net investment income in 2008 reflected an increase in fixed maturities income of $295 million due to the increase in fixed 75 Table of Contents maturity securities relating to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions and the continued investment of cash flow from operations. Additionally, the increase in dividend income of $15 million on our equity securities was mainly attributable to the additional equity securities acquired with Safeco. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in limited partnership income due to reduced valuations. Our average investment yield was 4.87% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 4.81% for the year ended December 31, 2007. See  Investment Portfolio. Fee and Other Revenues . Fee and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $50 million, an increase of $17 million, or 51.5%, over the year ended December 31, 2007 driven primarily by the additional premium installment fees generated by the acquired Safeco business. Net Realized Investment Losses . Net realized investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $407 million, an increase of $402 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily the result of a $206 million increase in impairment losses and a $161 million increase in investment losses on sales of our equity securities compared to 2007. The equity security sales and impairment losses contributed to the overall decline in the average preferred and common stock investment balances compared to 2007. Claims and expenses Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses . Claims and claim adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $4.326 billion, an increase of $1.725 billion, or 66.3%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 primarily reflected the impact of the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions net of efficiencies achieved through integration, and higher catastrophe losses of $260 million. The increase in 2008 also reflected unfavorable frequency trends across the commercial multiple peril, automobile physical damage (commercial and private passenger), and homeowners product lines, partially offset by an increase of $179 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily in commercial liability lines. Catastrophe losses included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $350 million compared to $90 million in 2007, an increase of $260 million. Catastrophe losses in 2008 were spread across our segments: $170 million in our Commercial segment, $123 million in our Personal segment and $57 million in our Corporate and Other segment. The Commercial and Personal segment catastrophes related primarily to tornado losses (primarily in Tennessee), wind and hail storms that impacted several regions throughout the United States (with high concentration in the Midwest) and the September 2008 Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. The $57 million of catastrophe losses in our Corporate and Other segment was driven by internal property catastrophe reinsurance losses, in part, associated with Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. Favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2008 totaled $497 million. Our Commercial segment accounted for $450 million, primarily driven by actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected and moderate severity trends within the commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines. Additionally, the Commercial segment experienced better than expected loss development in the general liability product line primarily driven by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends. General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $777 million, an increase of $226 million, or 41.0%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, including increased restructuring and integration costs of $25 million and additional intangible asset amortization of $16 million, partially offset by the extinguishment of pension and postretirement liabilities relating to the transfer of these plans to Liberty Mutual Group of $35 million. Goodwill Impairment . In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized an impairment charge of $973 million in our Personal segment as previously discussed. See  Overview  Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial Information  Goodwill. Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs . The amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $1.664 billion, an increase of $608 million, or 57.6% over 76 Table of Contents the year ended December 31, 2007. The growth in amortization costs in 2008 was primarily due to growth in business volume related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, consistent with the increase in net premiums earned. Interest Expense . Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $21 million, an increase of $15 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the Safeco acquisition. Income Tax Expense . Federal, state, and foreign income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $78 million, a decrease of $89 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was (16.0%) compared to 30.7% for December 31, 2007. Net income (loss) Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $564 million versus net income of $377 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net loss in 2008 was adversely impacted by the $973 million impairment to our goodwill asset and $407 million of net realized investment losses, partially offset by favorable operating results discussed in more detail above. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $934 million, an increase of $335 million, or 55.9%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to additional earnings and investment income generated by the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions and an increase of $179 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2008 compared to 2007. These items were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $260 million and an increase in non-catastrophe property losses, primarily driven by unfavorable frequency in the commercial multiple peril, automobile physical damage (commercial and private passenger) and homeowners product lines. Combined ratio The following table sets forth the consolidated combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended Change in December 31, Percentage 2008 2007 Points Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio(1) 64.7 % 65.4 % (0.7 ) Underwriting expense ratio(2) 33.0 35.0 (2.0 ) Subtotal 97.7 100.4 (2.7 ) Catastrophes(3) 5.1 2.1 3.0 Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (7.2 ) (7.4 ) 0.2 Combined ratio(4) 95.6 % 95.1 % 0.5 % (1) Calculated by dividing claims and claim adjustment expenses by net premiums earned (net of premiums earned attributable to prior years). Catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years are excluded from claims and claim adjustment expenses. (2) The underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs less fee revenues by net premiums earned (net of premiums earned attributable to prior years). Integration and other acquisition related costs associated with the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, intangible amortization, and bad debt expenses have been excluded from the combined ratio. These costs are reflected within general and administrative expenses. (3) Calculated by dividing catastrophes by net premiums earned. Catastrophes include all current and prior year catastrophe losses. 77 Table of Contents (4) Calculated by adding the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio, underwriting expense ratio, catastrophes ratio, and net incurred losses attributable to prior years ratio. Our combined ratio before catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 97.7%, a decrease of 2.7 points versus the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio reflected favorable Surety losses due to both lower reported and paid claims activity, partially offset by unfavorable frequency in the commercial multiple peril, automobile physical damage (commercial and private passenger), and homeowners product lines as compared to the prior year. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio reflected the impact of writing more personal lines business, which typically has a lower expense ratio, and increased efficiencies resulting from the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions. Including the impact of catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years, the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 95.6%, an increase of 0.5 points over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 primarily reflected higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by the changes in the combined ratio previously discussed. Commercial Net Written Premiums The following table sets forth net written premiums by product line for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Commercial multiple peril $ 1,531 $ 1,193 $ 338 28.3 % Commercial automobile 923 662 261 39.4 Workers compensation 886 748 138 18.4 General liability 380 228 152 66.7 Other(1) 255 208 47 22.6 Total net written premiums $ 3,975 $ 3,039 $ 936 30.8 % (1) Other net written premiums consist primarily of inland marine, farmowners multiple peril, allied lines and fire. Commercial Multiple Peril. Commercial multiple peril net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased $338 million, or 28.3%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected an increase in premiums related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, $221 million and $150 million, respectively (i.e., with respect to Ohio Casualty, the amount by which its contribution to our net written premiums in 2008 exceeded its contribution in 2007; and with respect to Safeco, its contribution to our net written premiums in 2008). Excluding the effects of the acquisitions, commercial multiple peril net written premiums decreased $33 million, or 3.0%, reflecting lower retention and modest declines in rate due to competitive market conditions, partially offset by increased new business levels in 2008. Commercial Automobile. Commercial automobile net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $261 million, or 39.4%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected an increase in premiums related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, $166 million and $115 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions, commercial automobile net written premiums decreased $20 million, or 3.4%, reflecting lower retention and rate decreases due to competitive market conditions, partially offset by increased new business levels in 2008. Workers Compensation. Workers compensation net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased $138 million, or 18.4%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily 78 Table of Contents reflected an increase in premiums related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, $79 million and $29 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions, workers compensation net written premiums increased $30 million, or 4.2%, due to increased new business levels, partially offset by modest declines in retention and rate. General Liability. General liability net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased $152 million, or 66.7%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected an increase in premiums related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, $117 million and $30 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions, general liability net written premiums increased $5 million, or 2.8%. The increase was driven by increased new business, partially offset by decreases in premium rates and lower levels of retention. Other. Other net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased $47 million, or 22.6%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected an increase in premiums related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, $19 million and $40 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions, other net written premiums decreased $12 million, or 6.0%. The decrease was driven by a reduction in rate and retention levels due to a competitive market environment. Results of operations The following table sets forth results of operations for the Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Revenues Net premiums earned $ 4,024 $ 3,025 $ 999 33.0 % Net investment income 402 287 115 40.1 Fee and other revenues 30 23 7 30.4 Total revenues 4,456 3,335 1,121 33.6 Total claims and expenses(1) 3,843 2,835 1,008 35.6 Pre-tax operating income $ 613 $ 500 $ 113 22.6 % (1) Integration and other acquisition related costs associated with the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions of $19 million in 2008 and $26 million in 2007 have been excluded from total claims and expenses. Revenues Revenues for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $4.456 billion, an increase of $1.121 billion, or 33.6%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $4.024 billion, an increase of $999 million, or 33.0%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 reflected an increase of $578 million of premium related to the Ohio Casualty acquisition, $424 million of premium related to the Safeco acquisition, and the net premiums earned associated with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $402 million, an increase of $115 million, or 40.1%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 reflected earnings from the additional invested assets assumed from the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions and continued investment of cash flow from operations. Fee and Other Revenues . Fee and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $30 million, an increase of $7 million, or 30.4%, over the year ended December 31, 2007 largely due to the additional fee revenues generated by the acquisitions of Ohio Casualty and Safeco. 79 Table of Contents Claims and expenses Claims and expenses for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $3.843 billion, an increase of $1.008 billion, or 35.6%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions (including additional intangible asset amortization of $11 million) net of efficiencies achieved through integration, higher catastrophe losses of $115 million, higher costs of $47 million associated with third-party claims adjusters driven by higher usage in 2008 related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, and unfavorable property frequency across our commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines. These items were partially offset by an increase of $119 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2008 compared to 2007 and favorable commercial liability loss experience. Catastrophe losses included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $170 million compared to $55 million in 2007, an increase of $115 million. Catastrophe losses in 2008 were primarily driven by tornado losses (primarily in Tennessee), wind and hail storms that impacted several regions throughout the United States (with high concentration in the Midwest) and the September 2008 Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. Favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years of $450 million in 2008 were primarily driven by actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected and moderate severity trends within the commercial multiple peril product line. Additionally, favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in the general liability product line were primarily driven by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $613 million, an increase of $113 million, or 22.6%, over the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from the additional earnings and investment income generated by the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions and an increase of $119 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2008 compared to 2007. These items were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $115 million, increased costs of $47 million associated with third-party claims adjusters mainly related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, unfavorable frequency across most property lines, mainly within the commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines. Combined Ratio The following table sets forth the combined ratio for our Commercial segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended Change in December 31, Percentage 2008 2007 Points Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio 66.3 % 66.4 % (0.1 ) Underwriting expense ratio 34.8 35.5 (0.7 ) Subtotal 101.1 101.9 (0.8 ) Catastrophes 4.2 1.8 2.4 Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (11.2 ) (10.9 ) (0.3 ) Combined ratio 94.1 % 92.8 % 1.3 The Commercial segment combined ratio before catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 101.1%, a decrease of 0.8 points from the year ended December 31, 2007. The slight decrease in the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio was attributable to favorable commercial liability loss experience, offset by adverse non-catastrophe weather experience driving unfavorable frequency across most property lines and an increase in costs associated with third-party claims 80 Table of Contents adjusters. The underwriting expense ratio decreased year over year due to efficiencies gained from the Ohio Casualty acquisition and lower agency profit share expenses consistent with catastrophe activity. Including the impact of catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years, the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 94.1%, an increase of 1.3 points over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected higher catastrophe losses including tornado losses (primarily in Tennessee), wind and hail storms that impacted several regions throughout the United States (with high concentration in the Midwest) and the September 2008 Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, partially offset by decreases in the combined ratio previously discussed. Personal Net Written Premiums The following table sets forth net written premiums by product line for our Personal segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Private passenger automobile $ 1,500 $ 572 $ 928 162.2 % Homeowners 472 321 151 47.0 Other(1) 150 55 95 172.7 Total net written premiums $ 2,122 $ 948 $ 1,174 123.8 % (1) Other net written premiums consist primarily of fire, allied lines, general liability, and inland marine Private Passenger Automobile. Private passenger automobile net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $928 million, or 162.2%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected an increase in premiums related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, $163 million and $640 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions, private passenger automobile net written premiums increased $125 million, or 25.4%, reflecting increased new business driven primarily by territory expansion. Homeowners. Homeowners net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $151 million, or 47.0%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected an increase in premiums related to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions of $92 million and $80 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions, homeowners net written premiums decreased by $21 million, or 7.7%, primarily due to increased ceded premium related to the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty ($224 million). Further adjusting for the impact of the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty, net written premiums increased 23.1% primarily due to increased new business due to territory expansion. Other. Other net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $95 million, or 172.7%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, $26 million and $62 million, respectively.

Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $2.277 billion, an increase of $1.383 billion, or 154.7%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 reflected $273 million and $665 million of additional premium from the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions, respectively, and the net premiums earned associated with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $131 million, an increase of $84 million, or 178.7%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 reflected earnings from the additional invested assets assumed as a result of the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions and continued investment of cash flow from operations. Fee and Other Revenues . Fee and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $20 million, an increase of $13 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 primarily reflected the additional premium installment fees generated by the addition of the Safeco business. Claims and expenses Claims and expenses for our Personal segment during the year ended December 31, 2008 were $2.342 billion, an increase of $1.465 billion, or 167.0% over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 primarily reflected the impact of the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions net of efficiencies gained through integration, higher catastrophe losses of $95 million, increased costs of $94 million primarily due to higher utilization of third-party claims adjusters related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, and adverse non-catastrophe weather experience driving unfavorable frequency in the private passenger automobile physical damage and homeowner product lines. Catastrophe losses included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $123 million compared to $28 million in 2007, an increase of $95 million. Catastrophe losses in 2008 were driven by tornado losses (primarily in Tennessee), several wind and hail storms throughout the United States and the September 2008 Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. 82 Table of Contents Favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years of $43 million in 2008 were primarily driven by the private passenger automobile liability line due to better than expected loss trends. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for our Personal segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $86 million, an increase of $15 million, or 21.1%, over the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from additional operating earnings and efficiencies generated by the acquisitions of Ohio Casualty and Safeco, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $95 million, increased costs of $94 million associated with third-party claims adjusters mainly related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, and adverse non-catastrophe weather experience in the private passenger automobile and homeowner product lines. Combined Ratio The following table sets forth the combined ratio for our Personal segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended Change in December 31, Percentage 2008 2007 Points Claims and claim adjustment expense ratio 68.9 % 66.0 % 2.9 Underwriting expense ratio 28.7 33.1 (4.4 ) Subtotal 97.6 99.1 (1.5 ) Catastrophes 5.4 3.1 2.3 Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (1.9 ) (5.1 ) 3.2 Combined ratio 101.1 % 97.1 % 4.0 The Personal segment combined ratio before catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 97.6%, a decrease of 1.5 points from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the claims and claim adjustment expense ratio reflected unfavorable frequency in the private passenger automobile and homeowner product lines due to adverse non-catastrophe weather experience and increased costs associated with third-party claims adjusters. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily due to lower costs associated with the acquired Safeco business, scale benefits immediately recognized from the Safeco acquisition, and lower agency profit share expenses consistent with catastrophe activity and overall underwriting results. Including the impact of catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years, the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 101.1%, an increase of 4.0 points over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflected higher catastrophe losses related to Hurricanes Ike & Gustav, tornadoes, and Midwest storm activity, and a decrease in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2008 as compared to 2007, partially offset by the changes in the combined ratio previously discussed. 83 Table of Contents Surety Net Written Premiums The following table sets forth net written premiums by product line for our Surety segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Contract bond $ 298 $ 213 $ 85 39.9 % Commercial bond 66 43 23 53.5 Small bond(1) 115 56 59 105.4 Total net written premiums $ 479 $ 312 $ 167 53.5 % (1) Small bond net written premiums consist of contract and commercial bonds covering small- and mid-size businesses and individuals distributed through our network of independent property and casualty insurance agencies.

Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $37 million, an increase of $12 million, or 48.0%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 reflected earnings from the additional invested assets assumed as a result of the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions and continued investment of cash flow from operations. Claims and expenses Claims and expenses for our Surety segment during the year ended December 31, 2008 were $359 million, an increase of $138 million, or 62.4%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 primarily reflected the impact of the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions and a decrease of $4 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years as compared to 2007, partially offset by lower reported and paid claims activity as compared to the prior year. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for our Surety segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $156 million, an increase of $60 million, or 62.5%, over the year ended December 31, 2007, driven by additional earnings from the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions and lower reported and paid claims activity. These items were partially offset by a decrease of $4 million in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years as compared to 2007. Combined Ratio The following table sets forth the combined ratio for our Surety segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended Change in December 31, Percentage 2008 2007 Points Claims and claim expense ratio 32.3 % 36.7 % (4.4 ) Underwriting expense ratio 46.2 46.6 (0.4 ) Subtotal 78.5 83.3 (4.8 ) Catastrophes    Net incurred losses attributable to prior years (3.8 ) (7.6 ) 3.8 Combined ratio 74.7 % 75.7 % (1.0 ) The Surety segment combined ratio before catastrophes and net incurred losses attributable to prior years for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 78.5%, a decrease of 4.8 points from the year ended December 31, 2007.

Including the impact of net incurred losses attributable to prior years, the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 74.7%, a decrease of 1.0 points from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease of 1.0 points was primarily attributable to the changes in the combined ratio previously discussed, 85 Table of Contents partially offset by a decrease in the amount of favorable incurred losses attributable to prior years in 2008 compared to 2007. Corporate and Other Net Written Premiums The following table sets forth the net written premiums for our Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Assumed inter-segment reinsurance arrangements $ 207 $ 141 $ 66 46.8 % External ceded reinsurance (79 ) (33 ) (46 ) 139.4 Total net written premiums $ 128 $ 108 $ 20 18.5 % Net written premiums for our Corporate and Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $128 million and $108 million, respectively, representing an increase of $20 million, or 18.5%. The increase reflected additional premium relating to our inter-segment reinsurance arrangements of $66 million driven in large part by increased exposures associated with the Ohio Casualty acquisition, offset by additional external reinsurance premium ceded of $46 million due to increased exposures requiring reinsurance protection due to the Ohio Casualty acquisition. Inter-Segment Reinsurance Arrangements We use inter-segment reinsurance arrangements as a tool to provide our Commercial and Personal operating segments the flexibility to retain the risks and benefits they believe are appropriate given the size and scope of their segment operations. The table below reflects written premiums assumed (ceded) under the inter-segment reinsurance arrangements: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Commercial $ (163 ) $ (109 ) $ (54 ) 49.5 % Personal (44 ) (32 ) (12 ) 37.5 Corporate and Other 207 141 66 46.8 Total net written premiums $  $  $   % 86 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the results of operations for our Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007: Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Revenues Net premiums earned $ 134 $ 117 $ 17 14.5 % Net investment income(1) 149 46 103 * Net realized investment losses (407 ) (5 ) (402 ) * Fee and other revenues     Total revenues (124 ) 158 (282 ) (178.5 ) Total claims and expenses 172 245 (73 ) (29.8 ) Interest expense 21 6 15 * Loss before income tax expense (317 ) (93 ) (224 ) * Pre-tax operating income (loss)(2) $ 79 $ (68 ) $ 147 * (1) The difference between our actual net investment income and the allocated business segment investment income is reported in Corporate and Other.

Revenues Revenues for our Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $(124) million, a decrease of $282 million, or 178.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2007. Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $134 million, an increase of $17 million, or 14.5%, over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 was primarily driven by the net written premiums earned associated with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed. Net Investment Income . Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $149 million, an increase of $103 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2008 was primarily driven by an increase in the difference between actual net investment income and allocated net investment income in 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Additionally, the increase in 2008 was related to higher invested asset base associated with the increased block of run-off reserves acquired through the Safeco acquisition. Net Realized Investment Losses . Net realized investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $407 million, an increase of $402 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily the result of a $206 million increase in impairment losses and a $161 million increase in investment losses on sales of our equity securities compared to 2007. The equity security sales and impairment losses contributed to the overall decline in the average preferred and common stock investment balances compared to 2007. See  Investment Portfolio. Claims and expenses Claims and expenses for our Corporate and Other segment during the year ended December 31, 2008 were $172 million, a decrease of $73 million, or 29.8% from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease 87 Table of Contents primarily reflected an increase in the amount of loss recoveries relating to our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage from Liberty Mutual consistent with the significant catastrophe activity in 2008 (largely Hurricanes Ike and Gustav), unfavorable losses attributable to prior years in 2007 within both our run-off (mainly A&E claims) and reinsurance operations, and lower litigation expenses. These items were partially offset by unfavorable loss experience associated with our inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, largely due to the aforementioned 2008 catastrophe activity. Interest expense Interest expense for our Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $21 million, an increase of $15 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflects the impact of the Safeco acquisition. Pre-tax operating income Pre-tax operating income for Corporate and Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $79 million, an increase of $147 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily driven by higher net investment income of $103 million and an increase in the amount of loss recoveries relating to our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage with Liberty Mutual consistent with the significant catastrophe activity in 2008 (largely Hurricanes Ike and Gustav). Third-party catastrophe reinsurance recoveries are recorded in our Corporate and Other segment. The related direct losses are recorded in our operating segments and our Corporate and Other segment records the associated assumed losses to the extent covered by inter-segment reinsurance arrangements. Further impacting the increase in pre-tax operating income in 2008 were unfavorable losses attributable to prior years in 2007 within both our run-off operations (mainly A&E claims) and reinsurance operations, an increase in net premiums earned consistent with the changes in net written premiums previously discussed, and lower litigation expenses. These items were partially offset by unfavorable loss experience associated with our inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, largely due to the aforementioned 2008 catastrophe activity, and higher interest expense. Investment Portfolio Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments, within specified limits and subject to some qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and some other investments. Investment Strategy Our investment strategy seeks long-term returns through disciplined security selection, portfolio diversity and an integrated approach to risk management. We select and monitor investments to balance the goals of safety, stability, liquidity, growth and after-tax total return with the need to comply with regulatory investment requirements. Asset liability management is accomplished by setting an asset target duration range that is influenced by the following factors: (i) the estimated reserve payout pattern, (ii) the inclusion of our tactical capital market views into the investment decision making process and (iii) our overall risk tolerance. We aim to achieve a relatively safe and stable income stream by maintaining a broad-based portfolio of investment grade bonds. These holdings are supplemented by investments in additional asset types with the objective of further enhancing the portfolios diversification and expected returns. These additional asset types include commercial mortgages and other real estate financing investments, non-investment grade bonds, and common and preferred stock. We manage our investment risks through consideration of duration of liabilities, diversification, credit limits, careful analytic review of each investment decision, and comprehensive risk assessments of the overall portfolio. Our investment policy and strategy are reviewed and approved by the board of directors of each of our insurance subsidiaries, which meet on a regular basis to review and consider investment activities, tactics and new investment classes. Pursuant to the terms of investment management agreements, and with the oversight of the board of directors of each of our insurance subsidiaries and our Chief Financial Officer, Liberty Mutual manages our insurance subsidiaries investment portfolios with an experienced team of investment personnel.

(2) Excludes net realized investment gains and losses and net unrealized investment gains and losses Net Investment Income The following table summarizes our net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Net Investment Income 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Fixed maturities $ 932 $ 651 $ 356 Equity securities 28 45 30 Limited partnerships and LLCs (43 ) (15 ) 3 Mortgage loans 14 7 1 Cash and cash equivalent interest 12 27 18 Other investment income 5 8 3 Gross investment income 948 723 411 Investment expenses (38 ) (4 ) (6 ) Net investment income $ 910 $ 719 $ 405 Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $910 million, an increase of $191 million over the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net investment income in 2009 reflected a higher average invested asset base due to $8.6 billion of investments acquired with the Safeco acquisition as well as the continued reinvestment of cash flows from operations. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in limited partnership income of $28 million, reflecting reduced market valuations, a decrease in dividend income due to the reduction in the equity portfolio and higher investment expenses due to the Safeco acquisition, additional management fees, and variable compensation costs. The higher asset base as well as a 0.2% increase in the average investment yield contributed $281 million in investment income from fixed maturities in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with the prior year. The $15 million reduction in investment income from cash and cash equivalent investments was primarily the result of lower yields compared with the prior year. Investment income on mortgage loans increased by $7 million in 2009 from the prior year driven by an increase in the asset base and is consistent with our diversification strategy. For the 89 Table of Contents year ended December 31, 2009, the average investment yield excluding net realized investment gains and losses was 4.67% compared with 4.92% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $719 million, an increase of $314 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net investment income in 2008 reflected an increase in the average invested asset base from the Safeco and Ohio Casualty acquisitions and the continued reinvestment of cash flow from operations. The $295 million increase in fixed maturities income was primarily the result of a $172 million increase in taxable bonds and a $124 million increase in tax-exempt bonds over the same period in 2007. The $18 million decrease in limited partnership income from the same period in 2007 was driven by reduced market valuations during the last quarter of 2008 and a lack of exit opportunities as a result of the economic environment during that time. Current Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio mix at December 31, 2009 consisted in large part of high quality, fixed maturity securities and short-term investments with a smaller allocation to common and preferred equity securities and other investments, such as mortgage loans, private equity and private real estate investments. Many of these other investments are held in limited partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs). We believe that prudent levels of investments in common equity securities and other investments within our investment portfolio are likely to enhance long term after-tax total returns without significantly increasing the risk profile of the portfolio. We regularly review our entire portfolio in the context of macroeconomic and capital market conditions.

The increase reflects investment of cash flows from operations and an increase in unrealized gains primarily due to a decrease in credit spreads. Partially offsetting the increase was a decline in the equity investment holdings as we reduced our exposure to common equities. Fixed maturities available for sale as of December 31, 2009 were $20.125 billion, an increase of $3.305 billion, or 19.6%, over December 31, 2008. The increase reflects market value increases and additional purchases of fixed income securities. Equity securities available for sale as of December 31, 2009 were $301 million ($85 million common stock and $216 million preferred stock versus $215 million common stock and $286 million preferred stock as of December 31, 2008), a decrease of $200 million or 39.9% from December 31, 2008. The decrease in total equity securities available for sale primarily reflects the sale of common equities partially offset by market appreciation. 90 Table of Contents Short term investments as of December 31, 2009 were $109 million, a decrease of $273 million, or 71.5%, from December 31, 2008. This decrease reflected a decline in short term assets held as collateral in connection with our securities lending program and redeployment into the fixed maturities portfolio. Mortgage loans as of December 31, 2009 were $271 million, an increase of $70 million or 34.8% over December 31, 2008. The increase reflected $77 million of new capital loaned, and $7 million in principal repayments. The entire mortgage loan portfolio was U.S. based. As of December 31, 2009, the average total loan size was $1.5 million and the average loan participation size was $0.1 million. At December 31, 2009, approximately 91% of the loans were full or partial recourse to borrowers. Other investments include limited partnerships and LLCs. As of December 31, 2009, other investments were $150 million, a decrease of $40 million or 21.1% over December 31, 2008. These investments consist of traditional private equity partnerships of $37 million, other partnerships of $39 million, and real estate partnerships of $74 million. Our investments in limited partnerships and LLCs are long-term in nature and highly illiquid. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2009 were $1.548 billion, a decrease of $420 million, or 21.3%, from December 31, 2008. This decrease reflects the purchase of long-term securities partially offset by cash generated from operations and the previously mentioned equity security sales. In general, we expect cash and cash equivalent assets to range between 2% to 5% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2009, our available-for-sale investment securities reflected $761 million as Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets), primarily U.S. Treasuries. The majority of our invested assets are reported as Level 2 (quoted prices from other observable inputs). As of December 31, 2009, we reported $19.46 billion of our available-for-sale investment securities as Level 2, consisting primarily of various fixed maturity securities. Finally, we reported $309 million as Level 3 (unobservable inputs), primarily comprised of corporate bonds for which a market price is not readily available. As of December 31, 2009, we had unfunded commitments in traditional private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships, and other, of $41 million, $241 million and $12 million respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we had commitments to purchase various residential mortgage-backed securities at a cost and fair market value of $119 million. The following tables summarize our available-for-sale portfolio by security type as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008: As of December 31, 2009 Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cost Gains Losses Value (Dollars in millions) U.S. government and agency securities $ 706 $ 21 $ (2 ) $ 725 Mortgage and asset-backed securities: Residential 4,730 142 (46 ) 4,826 Commercial 558 11 (17 ) 552 Other mortgage and ABS securities 920 37 (19 ) 938 U.S. state and municipal 8,319 471 (48 ) 8,742 Corporate and other 4,137 229 (41 ) 4,325 Foreign government securities 18  (1 ) 17 Total fixed maturities 19,388 911 (174 ) 20,125 Common stock 53 32 (− ) 85 Preferred stock 205 26 (15 ) 216 Total equity securities 258 58 (15 ) 301 Total securities available for sale $ 19,646 $ 969 $ (189 ) $ 20,426 91 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008 Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cost Gains Losses Value (Dollars in millions) U.S. government and agency securities $ 604 $ 47 $ (2 ) $ 649 Mortgage and asset-backed securities: Residential 3,162 84 (91 ) 3,155 Commercial 551 1 (67 ) 485 Other mortgage and ABS securities 792 12 (38 ) 766 U.S. state and municipal 8,568 97 (409 ) 8,256 Corporate and other 3,746 41 (298 ) 3,489 Foreign government securities 18 2  20 Total fixed maturities 17,441 284 (905 ) 16,820 Common stock 282  (67 ) 215 Preferred stock 329 21 (64 ) 286 Total equity securities 611 21 (131 ) 501 Total securities available for sale $ 18,052 $ 305 $ (1,036 ) $ 17,321 The following table summarizes our allocation of fixed maturities by credit quality as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008: As of December 31, 2009 2008 Fair % of Fair % of Fixed Maturities by Credit Quality(1) Value Total Value Total (Dollars in millions) AAA $ 9,863 49.0 % $ 8,071 48.0 % AA+, AA, AA− 4,193 20.8 4,223 25.1 A+, A, A− 3,191 15.9 2,599 15.4 BBB+, BBB, BBB− 1,943 9.7 1,506 8.9 Total investment grade 19,190 95.4 % 16,399 97.4 % BB+, BB, BB− 472 2.3 213 1.3 B+, B, B− 382 1.9 196 1.2 CCC or lower 81 0.4 12 0.1 Total below investment grade 935 4.6 % 421 2.6 % Total fixed maturities $ 20,125 100.0 % $ 16,820 100.0 % (1) For purposes of this disclosure, credit quality is primarily based upon S&Ps ratings. As of December 31, 2009, no single issuer, excluding U.S. Treasuries, agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, accounted for more than 1% of invested assets. Our allocation to investment grade securities decreased slightly to 95.4% at December 31, 2009 from 97.4% December 31, 2008. We had 4.6% of our fixed maturity securities invested in non-investment grade securities at December 31, 2009, an increase of 2.0% compared to December 31, 2008 primarily due to the significant tightening of non-investment grade credit spreads and downgrades on investment grade securities. As of December 31, 2009, the overall average credit quality rating stood at AA. Our holdings of below investment grade securities primarily consist of an actively managed diversified portfolio of fixed rate high yield securities and floating rate loans. 92 Table of Contents The following tables summarize our mortgage and asset-backed fixed maturity portfolio by credit quality as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: As of December 31, 2009 Mortgage and Asset-Backed Fixed B or % of Maturities by Credit Quality AAA AA A BBB BB Lower Total Total (Dollars in millions) SBA(1) loans $ 727 $  $  $  $  $  $ 727 11.5 % GNMA(2) residential mortgage 2,384      2,384 37.8 FNMA(3) residential mortgage 935      935 14.8 FHLMC(4) residential mortgage 1,208      1,208 19.1 Prime residential mortgage 133  6 15 6 37 197 3.1 Alt-A residential mortgage 38  1 1  24 64 1.0 Sub-prime residential mortgage 7 5 11 3  12 38 0.6 Commercial mortgage backed securities 439 33 39 41   552 8.8 Non-mortgage asset backed securities 121 22 28 19 18 3 211 3.3 Total $ 5,992 $ 60 $ 85 $ 79 $ 24 $ 76 $ 6,316 100.0 % % of Total 94.9 % 0.9 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 0.4 % 1.2 % 100.0 % (1) SBA is the Small Business Administration.

During 2009, we moved some of our liquidity into longer-term mortgage backed securities. GNMAs increased by $2.241 billion, reflecting acquisitions in 2009 as part of our overall strategy to improve liquidity and credit quality. Over 94% of our mortgage and asset-backed holdings were rated AAA at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, our commercial mortgage backed securities portfolio was well diversified and of high quality with over 85% rated AA or above, approximately 16% of the underlying collateral having been defeased with U.S. Treasuries, and less than 18% of the holdings backed by 2006 to 2008 vintage transactions. 93 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our allocation of fixed maturities by maturity date as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008: As of December 31, 2009 2008 Fair % of Fair % of Fixed Maturities by Maturity Date Value Total Value Total (Dollars in millions) 1 year or less $ 565 2.8 % $ 352 2.1 % Over 1 year through 5 years 3,494 17.4 2,975 17.7 Over 5 years through 10 years 3,241 16.1 2,706 16.1 Over 10 years 6,509 32.3 6,381 37.9 Mortgage and asset-backed securities 6,316 31.4 4,406 26.2 Total fixed maturities $ 20,125 100.0 % $ 16,820 100.0 % During 2009, after taking into consideration changes in investment opportunities and our view of the current and prospective business and economic environment, we made only minor adjustments to the average life of our investment portfolio. Included in our fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2009 was $4.325 billion of corporate and other fixed maturities. These credit exposures are diversified across a number of industries. The following table shows the industry credit sectors for those exposures. At December 31, 2009, the corporate and other portfolio was approximately 20% of our fixed maturity portfolio.

The decrease in 2009 and increase in 2008 reflect impairment losses recorded in 2008 on fixed maturity and equity investments related to securities deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to market conditions. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Staff Position FAS 115-2 and 124-2 Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments as codified in FASB Codification Update to FASB Accounting Codification (ASC) 320, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities . See Note 1  Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our historical consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus for details. In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, net of income taxes, in the amount of $3 million. The adjustment was an increase to retained earnings and a corresponding decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 95 Table of Contents The following tables summarize our significant impairments by issuer for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, 2009 Fixed Preferred Common Total by Impairments by Issuer Maturities Stock Stock Other Issuer (Dollars in millions) LMIA High Yield Fund $  $  $ (28 ) $  $ (28 ) Bank of America (5 ) (9 )   (14 ) Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (9 )    (9 ) Citigroup Inc.  (9 )   (9 ) AIG (4 ) (4 )   (8 ) Total other (26 ) (3 )  (5 ) (34 ) Total by security type $ (44 ) $ (25 ) $ (28 ) $ (5 ) $ (102 ) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Fixed Preferred Common Total by Impairments by Issuer Maturities Stock Stock Issuer (Dollars in millions) Freddie Mac $  $ (44 ) $  $ (44 ) Fannie Mae  (32 ) (8 ) (40 ) Lehman Brothers (13 )   (13 ) General Electric   (10 ) (10 ) Wells Fargo Company  (9 )  (9 ) Other (48 ) (9 ) (36 ) (93 ) Total by security type $ (61 ) $ (94 ) $ (54 ) $ (209 ) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Fixed Preferred Common Total by Impairments by Issuer Maturities Stock Stock Issuer (Dollars in millions) Fannie Mae $ (1 ) $  $  $ (1 ) Other (2 )   (2 ) Total by security type $ (3 ) $  $  $ (3 ) If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, the decline is recorded as an unrealized loss in stockholders equity. If we believe the decline is other-than-temporary, and we believe that we will not be able to collect all cash flows due on our fixed income securities, then the carrying value of the investment is written down to the expected cash flow amount and a realized loss is recorded as a credit impairment. A non-credit impairment loss is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes as the difference between expected cash flow and fair value. As a result of our quarterly other-than-temporary impairment review, investment impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $100 million, compared to $209 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded impairment losses on our available-for-sale fixed maturities of $44 million compared to $61 million and $3 million in the same periods in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included within the $44 million of impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $5 million of charges recognized as non-credit impairments. We concluded that the remaining gross unrealized losses of our available-for-sale fixed maturities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were temporary. For equity securities, if we believe the decline is other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value and a realized loss is recorded. The gross unrealized losses recorded 96 Table of Contents on equity securities at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 resulted primarily from decreases in quoted market values from the dates that certain investment securities were acquired as opposed to fundamental changes in the issuers financial performance and near-term financial prospects. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded impairment losses on our available-for-sale equity securities of $53 million compared to $148 million and $0 in the same periods in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We concluded that the remaining gross unrealized losses of our available-for-sale equity securities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were temporary. The following table shows a schedule of our unrealized losses and fair value by security type by duration of potential impairment as of December 31, 2009: Less Than 12 Months Greater Than 12 Months Fair Value of Fair Value of Unrealized Losses and Fair Value by Unrealized Investments with Unrealized Investments with Security Type Losses Unrealized Losses Losses Unrealized Losses (Dollars in millions) U.S. Government and agency securities $ (2 ) $ 140 $  $  Mortgage and asset-backed securities: Residential (6 ) 569 (40 ) 149 Commercial  38 (17 ) 163 Other mortgage and ABS securities (5 ) 126 (14 ) 39 U.S. state and municipal (11 ) 426 (37 ) 248 Corporate and other (7 ) 321 (34 ) 231 Foreign government securities (1 ) 13   Total fixed maturities (32 ) 1,633 (142 ) 830 Common stock     Preferred stock   (15 ) 94 Total equity securities   (15 ) 94 Total securities available for sale $ (32 ) $ 1,633 $ (157 ) $ 924 The following table shows a schedule of our unrealized losses and fair value by security type by duration of potential impairment as of December 31, 2008: Less Than 12 Months Greater Than 12 Months Fair Value of Fair Value of Unrealized Losses and Fair Value by Unrealized Investments with Unrealized Investments with Security Type Losses Unrealized Losses Losses Unrealized Losses (Dollars in millions) U.S. Government and agency securities $ (2 ) $ 14 $  $  Mortgage and asset-backed securities: Residential (76 ) 285 (15 ) 32 Commercial (56 ) 391 (11 ) 81 Other mortgage and ABS securities (35 ) 229 (3 ) 14 U.S. state and municipal (333 ) 4,340 (76 ) 388 Corporate and other (192 ) 2,168 (106 ) 328 Foreign government Securities     Total fixed maturities (694 ) 7,427 (211 ) 843 Common stock (10 ) 52 (57 ) 160 Preferred stock (24 ) 137 (40 ) 63 Total equity securities (34 ) 189 (97 ) 223 Total securities available for sale $ (728 ) $ 7,616 $ (308 ) $ 1,066 97 Table of Contents Unrealized losses decreased from $1.036 billion as of December 31, 2008 to $189 million as of December 31, 2009 primarily due to a decrease in credit spreads. Individual securities that have been in a continuous, unrealized losses position for less than 12 months decreased from $728 million as of December 31, 2008 to $32 million as of December 31, 2009 and accounted for $696 million, or 82.2%, of the overall decrease in unrealized losses. Unrealized losses greater than 12 months decreased from $308 million to $157 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $151 million. Included in the $157 million and $308 million of unrealized losses at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $74 million and $56 million, respectively, of unrealized losses on securities that had been in an unrealized loss position of 10% or greater for more than twelve months. We monitor the difference between the amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities to ascertain whether declines in value are temporary in nature. The acquisition of Safeco assets in the third quarter of 2008 had a minimal impact on unrealized gains and losses as of December 31, 2008, as these assets were valued at fair value on September 22, 2008, the date of acquisition. Securities Lending We participate in a securities lending program to generate additional income, whereby certain of the domestic fixed maturity securities are loaned for a short period of time from our portfolio to qualifying third parties via lending agents. Terms of the agreement are for borrowers of these securities to provide collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. Acceptable collateral may be in the form of cash or permitted securities as outlined in the securities lending agreement. The fair value of the loaned securities is monitored and additional collateral is obtained if the fair value of the collateral falls below 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. Under the terms of the securities lending program, the lending agent indemnifies us against borrower defaults. The loaned securities remain a recorded asset of our company; however, we record a liability for the amount of cash collateral held, representing our obligation to return the collateral related to the loaned securities. Our collateral reinvestment guidelines encourage a risk-averse investment allocation of cash received as collateral for loans. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair values of fixed maturities loaned under our securities lending program were approximately $544 million and $263 million, respectively. Post Offering Investment Portfolio After this offering, we expect to make some changes to our investment portfolio consistent with our risk management strategy. We believe that existing macroeconomic and capital market conditions pose long-term risks to the market value of our invested assets. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average effective duration of our rate sensitive portfolio (fixed maturities, preferred stock and commercial mortgage loans) was 4.22 years. After the offering, we expect to reduce the duration of our rate sensitive portfolio by approximately six months to a year. However, the current interest rate environment poses trade-offs between investment yield and average maturity. Our aim is to balance these competing objectives in order to mitigate the impact to investment income. 98 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our fixed maturity portfolio distributions by credit quality and asset category as of December 31, 2008 and 2009 and our post offering targets: Fixed Maturities Portfolio as of Post-Offering December 31, December 31, Type of Investment Targets 2009 2008 Security credit quality Investment grade 90-92 % 95.4 % 97.4 % Non-investment grade 8-10 4.6 2.6 Asset Category Municipal bonds 25-45 43.4 49.1 Corporate and other 25-45 21.5 20.7 Mortgage and asset-backed securities 25-35 31.4 26.2 Other 2-10 3.7 4.0 Total fixed maturities portfolio 100 % 100 % 100 % Our holdings of below investment grade securities consist of an actively managed diversified portfolio of fixed rate high yield securities and floating rate loans. We expect post-offering to increase the allocation to floating rate loans such that the non-investment grade portion of the fixed maturities portfolio is between 8% and 10%. The changes in below investment grade securities are expected to provide additional investment income in a rising rate environment. We expect to increase our post-offering allocation of corporate and other securities from 21.5% of the total fixed maturities portfolio at December 31, 2009 to approximately 30% and our strategic asset allocation range for this asset category will remain between 25% to 45%. On a post-offering basis, we also expect to lower our allocation of municipal bonds from 43.4% of the total fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2009 to approximately 30% and our strategic asset allocation range for this asset category will remain between 25% to 45%. The reallocation of corporate and other securities and municipal bonds is consistent with our risk management strategy of reducing the duration of rate sensitive assets without materially impacting pre-tax investment income. Our equity investment strategy is to maximize long-term absolute total return through a diversified portfolio of equity and equity-related investments, including preferred stock holdings. Over time, we expect to increase our allocation to common stock opportunistically, from 0.3% as of December 31, 2009 to a long-run target of 5% to 10% of invested assets. The majority of the equity portfolio would be invested in U.S. public equities with the largest portion of the portfolio being indexed to the S&P 500. From time to time we may hire outside managers to actively manage portions of the equity portfolio targeting specific strategies that may include: international, small cap, mid-cap or other active strategies. Our limited partnership and LLC portfolio will be reduced from its level of 0.7% of invested assets as of December 31, 2009 to an immaterial amount. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio will be modestly increased from 1.2% of invested assets as of December 31, 2009 to a long-run target of approximately 3% of invested assets. The expected changes to our investment portfolio post offering are consistent with our risk management strategy, and the impact on pre-tax investment income is expected to be immaterial compared with the prior year. Enterprise Risk Management As a property and casualty insurer, we are exposed to many risks. These risks are a function of the environment in which we operate. Risks can be correlated, so an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of our business simultaneously and have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. These exposures require an entity-wide view of risk and an understanding of the potential 99 Table of Contents impact on all areas of our business. In addition, we evaluate whether our overall risks are within our risk appetite in order to maintain value for all areas of our business. Risk management is at the core of the operational execution of our strategic plan. Our ERM incorporates operational risk, tail events, reputational and other risks. Our philosophy and framework goes beyond the quantification, aggregation and identification of risks (and the correlations) inherent in the business and operations of the enterprise. This philosophy and framework permeates all aspects and levels of the organization, stressing regular communication within and among the business units, functional disciplines and other standing committees. It also provides management with a framework for evaluating the assumption of risk in the context of expected profit potential, capital and rating implications based on the most up-to-date market intelligence and within the confines of prescribed underwriting and risk tolerance guidelines. We maintain an ERM committee chaired by our Chief Executive Officer and coordinated by our Chief Financial Officer. This committee includes all members of our management committee. In addition to the ERM committee, we also maintain several other risk management functions including the surety credit committee, the corporate compliance committee, the reserve committee, the reinsurance credit committee, the accounting policy and internal auditing functions provided by Liberty Mutual and day-to-day ERM functions and controls within our business units. The risk committee of our board of directors provides oversight of our ERM activities and reviews the strategies and implementation of our ERM programs. Our certificate of incorporation and the Intercompany Agreement (see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement) will provide that for as long as Liberty Mutual beneficially owns at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, we are required to jointly manage our enterprise risk with Liberty Mutual (including, but not limited to, exposure to underwriting risks related to natural and other catastrophes, credit risk in our investment portfolios, insurance operations and otherwise and other risks that are of a nature subject to the oversight of Liberty Mutuals enterprise risk management committee) on a consolidated basis with and as determined by Liberty Mutual. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, and waive any claim with respect to, any business opportunity that may otherwise be available to us were enterprise risk management not so managed. As a result, our ability to undertake new risks outside of the enterprise risk appetite of Liberty Mutual, including writing new product lines and in certain geographic areas, may be restricted. Reinsurance Protection and Catastrophe Management Reinsurance Protection In the ordinary course of our business, we purchase reinsurance from high-quality, highly rated reinsurers, including Liberty Mutual. We purchase reinsurance to control our exposure to losses and protect our capital resources. Reinsurance purchased from Liberty Mutual is provided at market rates and substantially on the same terms and conditions offered by third party reinsurers. Reinsurance involves credit risk and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Reinsurance recoverables are reported after allowances for uncollectible amounts. We also hold collateral, including escrow funds and letters of credit, under reinsurance agreements. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis. Reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices and appropriate pricing of their product offerings. For additional information concerning reinsurance, see Note 7  Reinsurance to our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements to control our exposure to large property and casualty losses. These reinsurance agreements provide for one of two types of reinsurance:  treaty reinsurance (including catastrophe reinsurance), in which reinsurance is provided for a specified type or category of risks; and 100 Table of Contents  facultative reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single policy or policies for the same insured and each policy reinsured is separately negotiated. We utilize reinsurance agreements to limit our catastrophe exposure. Our property catastrophe treaty reinsurance program with Liberty Mutual covers 90% of losses between $500 million and $1.325 billion. In the event of a catastrophe, our property catastrophe reinsurance program can be reinstated for the remainder of the original contract term by paying a reinstatement premium that is based on a percentage of the coverage reinstated and the original property catastrophe coverage premium. Our property catastrophe reinsurance program does not cover personal or commercial property losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism as defined by the Terrorism Acts. However, the program does cover personal and commercial property losses resulting from non-certified acts of terrorism occurring within the United States and carried out by United States citizens, provided the losses were not caused by radioactive, nuclear, biological or chemical attacks. We also purchase property per risk excess of loss reinsurance, as well as, where we deem it appropriate, individual risk facultative reinsurance, which we will use to cover losses in excess of our retention up to as much as $500 million, depending upon the risk. For a description of our current property catastrophe reinsurance treaty, see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Reinsurance Agreements  Current Reinsurance Program. We did not write homeowners insurance in California prior to our acquisition of Safeco. During 2008, our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates became participating insurers of the California Earthquake Authority, which we refer to in this prospectus as CEA. The CEA is a publicly-managed, privately-funded organization that provides residential earthquake insurance in California. California requires insurers selling homeowners insurance in the state to offer earthquake insurance, either through coverage provided under the insurers policy or through participation in the CEA. Our exposure to potential losses from California earthquakes is limited through participation in the CEA. Although we are subject to future assessments by the CEA, we believe that our participation in the CEA has significantly reduced our exposure to earthquake losses in California. We do not believe that any future CEA assessment or risk capital surcharge would be material to our financial position. In order to help protect ourselves from the impact of severe property losses, we entered into a Homeowners Quota Share Treaty covering the period from December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2009. The treaty covered our homeowners policies property and liability coverages, including earthquake coverage provided by endorsement to those policies. Pursuant to the terms of the treaty, we ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers 31.7% of the net premium earned on our homeowners policies during the effective period of the treaty, subject to certain exclusions contained in the treaty. In turn, the reinsurers accepted 31.7% of our net liability for losses occurring during the effective period of the treaty, subject to their quota share of the following limits: (1) $2.3 billion as respects any one loss occurrence for all perils except earthquake; (2) $900 million as respects any one loss occurrence for earthquake; (3) $2.3 billion in the aggregate as respects all loss occurrences arising out of non-excluded acts of terrorism; and (4) $20 million in property loss for any one insured location and $1 million per policy in liability loss (exclusive of allocated loss adjustment expense payable in addition to these limits). Any recoveries under the treaty are allocated between Liberty Mutual, which also ceded a quota share of its homeowners business, and us in the same ratio that each partys losses bear to the total ceded losses under the treaty. We chose not to renew the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty as of January 1, 2010. For multiple workers compensation losses arising from a single occurrence, we have entered into a catastrophe reinsurance program with Liberty Mutual to cover 55% of workers compensation losses between $100 million and $300 million. The program covers losses that arise out of natural disasters and certified acts of terrorism under the Terrorism Acts, unless the losses result from nuclear, biological or chemical attacks. In the event of a catastrophe, our workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance program can be reinstated for the remainder of the original contract term by paying a reinstatement premium that is based on a percentage of the coverage reinstated and the original workers compensation catastrophe coverage premium. For a description of our current workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance treaty, see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Reinsurance Agreements  Current Reinsurance Program. 101 Table of Contents Because we believe that underwriting equipment breakdown coverage and adjusting equipment breakdown claims requires specialized knowledge, we have entered into equipment breakdown reinsurance agreements with both Liberty Mutual and unaffiliated reinsurers to cover 100% of our commercial equipment breakdown coverage liability, up to a maximum limit of $100 million for any one policy and any one accident. Subject to their limits of liability, these agreements cover our liability for damage to boilers and vessels caused by mechanical breakdown, electrical breakdown, rupture or explosions. Catastrophe Management The timing and size of catastrophe losses are unpredictable and the level of losses experienced in any year could be material to our operating results and financial position. We purchase reinsurance to mitigate exposure to catastrophic events. Catastrophe losses include not only natural events such as earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes and other types of storms, but also man-made events such as terrorist acts. The extent of losses caused by a given catastrophe is a function of both the amount and type of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. We monitor not only the PML associated with the exposures and events but also the average amount of loss given that the loss exceeds a threshold value, otherwise referred to as the conditional tail expectation. We recognize that some events potentially expose us to both a property and liability loss. Catastrophe Modeling We use third party computer models for hurricane and tornado/hail perils, for earthquake/fire following and terrorism perils to estimate losses our exposures would generate under various scenarios as well as the probability of those losses occurring. We use these models in conjunction with internal data to manage our exposure to catastrophe losses through individual risk selection and by monitoring our concentration of insurance written not only in catastrophe-prone areas, such as coastal regions, but also in a quarter mile concentric area. Natural catastrophe exposure is also managed through underwriting guidelines, pricing, use of sublimits, deductibles, and exclusions. We use PML information and other related information based on catastrophe modeling to evaluate and manage risk. We use this information and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage our exposure to catastrophic events. In making underwriting and reinsurance decisions for hurricane and earthquake exposures, we use third-party proprietary computer modeling in an attempt to estimate the likelihood that the loss from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed a particular amount. The table below sets forth the estimated probabilities that the loss from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars and as a percentage of our common equity). For example, on the basis described below in the tables, we estimate that there is a one percent chance that our loss from a single U.S. hurricane occurring in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $354 million. Single Single Likelihood of Exceedance(1) Hurricane Earthquake (Dollars in millions) 2.0% (1-in-50) $ 335 $ 142 1.0% (1-in-100) 354 272 0.4% (1-in-250) 524 347 0.1% (1-in-1,000) 1,150 910 (1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a 1-in-50 year event. As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and therefore the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe. 102 Table of Contents The threshold loss amounts in the tables above are net of third party reinsurance, after-tax and claim adjustment expenses, which historically through December 31, 2009 has been less than 3.3% of loss estimates. The above threshold loss amounts reflect the most recent version of the modeling software. The amounts for both hurricanes and earthquakes reflect U.S. property exposures. We do not believe the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts. This information in the tables is based on our in-force portfolio and catastrophic reinsurance program as of October 1, 2009 and the catastrophic reinsurance program as of January 1, 2010. Catastrophe modeling requires a significant amount of judgment and a number of assumptions, and relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. As a result, such models may fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or that are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period. Moreover, we are exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property coverage arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and we are exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, for example, floods, tornadoes and acts of terrorism. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable. Changing Climate Conditions and Emerging Issues The severe weather conditions over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future claims and trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers exposure to financial loss as a result of catastrophe and other weather related events. Some scientists believe that, in recent years, changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters. Accordingly, if climate conditions change in the future, the catastrophe models that we employ may be less reliable. We discuss how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for our business in this prospectus under Risk Factors. For example, among other things:  Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in unfavorable frequency and severity of claims under policies we issue. See Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business  Unpredictable catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  A number of legal and regulatory measures as well as social initiatives have been introduced in response to changing climate conditions. We cannot predict how these will impact our business. See Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business  We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, including legal, regulatory and social responses thereto, may have on our business. Climate change regulation also could increase our policyholders cost of doing business. For example, policyholders faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Also, increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and business. We regularly review emerging issues, such as changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to our modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modification or new products. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. 103 Table of Contents Involuntary Pools and Associations We are also a member of various involuntary pools and associations and serve as a servicing carrier for residual market organizations. We receive revenue related to acting as a servicing carrier and that revenue is included in our fee and other revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 the amounts included were $6 million, $9 million and $12 million, respectively. Reinsurance Recoverables All assets and liabilities related to ceded reinsurance contracts are reported on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets and net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. Reinsurance premiums and claims and claim adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with the terms of the reinsurance contracts and with GAAP. The consolidated statements of operations reflect premiums, benefits, and settlement expenses net of reinsurance ceded. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liabilities associated with the reinsured business. We evaluate reinsurance collectability and monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded. Amounts that are determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. Any subsequent collections are reported as part of claims and claim adjustment expenses. In the ordinary course of business, we assume reinsurance and also cede reinsurance to other insurers to reduce overall risk, including exposure to large losses and catastrophic events. We are also a member of various involuntary pools and associations and serve as a servicing carrier for residual market organizations. The following table summarizes our reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2009: Reinsurance Collateral Net Recoverables Held Recoverables (Dollars in millions) A.M.

As a servicing carrier, we retain no direct underwriting risk but instead cede 100% of the involuntary market premium and losses back to the pool. Payment of losses is shared by the pool participants in proportion to their pool participation, jointly and severally. Reinsurer credit risk with respect to any such involuntary pool or association is a function of the creditworthiness of all of the pool participants. We are party to an assumed retroactive reinsurance arrangement. At December 31, 2009, and 2008, cumulative incurred losses related to these reinsurance arrangements were $76 million and $65 million, respectively, and are included in other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. There are no reinsurance recoverables related to these transactions. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 we collected $333 million, $193 million and $179 million related to reinsurance recoveries. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Liquidity is a measure of our companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long-term cash requirements of our business operations and other obligations. The liquidity requirements of our business segments are met primarily by funds generated from operations, asset maturities and income received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims, claim adjustment expenses and operating expenses. Both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Claims settlements, premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. There are certain cash outflows such as catastrophe-related claims payments that are unpredictable in nature and could create increased liquidity needs. In addition, in many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss. The exact timing of the payment of claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty. Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates maintain portfolios of invested assets with varying maturities, a substantial amount of short-term investments, and external liquidity facilities that we believe provide adequate liquidity for the payment of claims. Management believes that our cash balances, cash flows from operations and cash flows from investments are adequate to meet expected cash requirements for the foreseeable future on both a holding company and operating subsidiary level. 105 Table of Contents Holding Company Liquidity and Capital Resources We conduct substantially all of our operations, other than our Surety segment, through our wholly owned insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, and therefore we are primarily dependent on dividends and statutorily permissible distributions, loans, tax payments and other payments of funds from these entities to meet our current and future obligations. However, our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or other distributions. The principal uses of liquidity for Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation are expected to be for dividend payments to holders of shares of our common stock, interest and principal payments on our debt obligations, capital investments in our subsidiaries, and holding company operating expenses. A source of cash for the payment of dividends is dividends from subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends is restricted under applicable insurance laws and regulations. Under the insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities. Our top-tier insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, Ohio and Washington. The insurance holding company laws applicable to our top-tier insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Washington require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other dividends made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurers surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurers net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles. In addition, and in conjunction with regulatory approval for our acquisition of Safeco, our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Washington are required to provide notice to, and obtain approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend until September 22, 2010. In Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Washington, dividend payments are further limited in that dividends can only be paid out of unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles. The insurance holding company laws applicable to our top-tier insurance subsidiary domiciled in New Hampshire require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other dividends made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds 10% of the insurers surplus as of the preceding December 31. For the first three months of 2010, our insurance subsidiaries declared and paid ordinary and extraordinary dividends to Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation totaling $2.471 billion. As a result of these dividends, our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay ordinary dividends for the remainder of 2010 was exhausted and the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries as of March 31, 2010 was $5.091 billion. In connection with a dividend we intend to declare to Liberty Mutual prior to this completion of this offering, we intend to seek regulatory approval for our top-tier insurance subsidiaries to make distributions in an aggregate amount of up to $ million. Neither Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation nor any of our subsidiaries or controlled affiliates provides any guarantees or other commitments (express or implied) of financial support to any of our subsidiaries or affiliates, except for such guarantees or commitments that are in writing. However, our Safeco and Ohio Casualty subsidiaries are guarantors of senior notes issued by a subsidiary of Liberty Mutual in exchange for senior notes of Safeco and Ohio Casualty, respectively. See  Operating Subsidiary Liquidity and Capital Resources  Debt Transactions. Operating Subsidiary Liquidity and Capital Resources One of the principal responsibilities of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates to their policyholders is to ensure that such insurance companies have ready access to funds to settle claims, including large unforeseen claims. We generally expect that positive cash flow from operations (underwriting activities, asset maturities and investment income) will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most scenarios. However, there is a possibility that our liquidity needs may change due to unexpected events. Such events include, among other things, one or more large catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time resulting in material incurred losses that may cause a liquidity strain for us. In addition, a liquidity strain could also occur in an illiquid investment market, such as that which was experienced in 2008 and which 106 Table of Contents continued into 2009. Investments that may be used to meet liquidity needs in the event of a liquidity strain may not be liquid, given inactive markets, or may have to be sold at a significant loss as a result of depressed prices. Historically, cash receipts generated from operations, consisting of insurance premiums, collections, net investment income, and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, generally have provided sufficient funds to pay losses as well as operating expenses of our insurance subsidiaries, including debt service payments on the long-term debt described below. Historically, our insurance subsidiaries have not routinely used cash receipts generated from operations to fund ordinary dividends to Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation. Our insurance subsidiaries provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies related to such premiums. Premiums and acquisition expenses are settled based on terms of trade as stipulated by an underwriting contract, and generally are received within the first year of inception of a policy when the premium is written. Operating expenses are generally paid within a year of being incurred. Claims, especially for casualty business, may take much longer before they are reported and ultimately settled. Therefore, the amount of claims paid in any one year is not necessarily related to the amount of net losses incurred, as reported in our combined statements of operations. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims payments, policy acquisition costs, claim adjustment expenses, payments of interest on debt obligations, purchase of investments, dividends, tax payments made to the parent and operating expenses (including corporate benefit costs). We generally maintain a certain amount in cash and short-term investments to meet unpredictable cash obligations. We monitor the duration of these investments, and purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate cash available to satisfy our maturing liabilities. As our investment strategy focuses on overall asset and liability durations, and not specific cash flows, asset sales may be required to satisfy obligations or rebalance asset portfolios. Our aggregate invested assets as of December 31, 2009 (including cash and cash equivalents) totaled $22.5 billion. If paid losses accelerate beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows or events lead to negative cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing in addition to our existing borrowing facilities. In times of extreme market volatility, credit markets could tighten leading to liquidity constraints. For example, throughout 2008, our investment portfolio was significantly impacted by the financial and credit crises and unprecedented market volatility, resulting in significant increases in both unrealized and realized losses. Such extreme volatility negatively impacted market liquidity and as a result, many of our assets, including certain fixed income and structured credit assets, remained illiquid. However, to ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle claims, we hold a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short-term investments and maintain available credit facilities. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $1.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, for certain insurance contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration-matched with the related liabilities. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had short term debt of $19 million and $0, respectively. Long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was as follows: 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) 4.875% Notes, due 2010 $  $ 19 7.25% Notes, due 2012 17 17 7.30% Notes, due 2014 20 20 Capital lease 21 25 Subtotal 58 81 Unamortized fair value adjustments 1 1 Total long-term debt excluding current maturities $ 59 $ 82 107 Table of Contents Debt Transactions On December 29, 2008, the following transactions occurred:  Liberty Mutual Group Inc. (LMGI), a subsidiary of Liberty Mutual, exchanged $281 million of the outstanding $300 million Safeco 4.875% Senior Notes due 2010 for a like principal amount of newly issued LMGI 4.875% Senior Notes due 2010;  LMGI exchanged $187 million of the outstanding $204 million Safeco 7.25% Senior Notes due 2012 for a like principal amount of newly issued LMGI 7.25% Senior Notes due 2012; and  LMGI exchanged $180 million of the outstanding $200 million Ohio Casualty 7.30% Senior Notes due 2014 for a like principal amount of newly issued LMGI 7.30% Senior Notes due 2014. Safeco and Ohio Casualty received and accepted the requisite consents to enable each to execute a supplemental indenture governing the Safeco and Ohio Casualty senior notes that remain outstanding. The supplemental indenture eliminated substantially all restrictive covenants and eliminated or modified certain events of default. Safeco and Ohio Casualty are named as guarantors of the newly issued LMGI Senior Notes that replace their respective debt. Liberty Mutual and one of its subsidiaries, LMHC Massachusetts Holdings Inc., are also named as guarantors on each of the newly issued LMGI Senior Notes. As a result of these exchange transactions, $648 million of debt that was previously a liability for our subsidiaries was extinguished and no gain or loss was recognized as carrying value approximated fair value. In conjunction with these exchange transactions, Safeco and Ohio Casualty issued preferred stock to Peerless Insurance Company, one of our subsidiaries, and Liberty Mutual. This preferred stock was retired in April of 2010. For further discussion of the preferred stock issuance, see Note 12  Stockholders Equity and Dividend Availability to our historical consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. On February 3, 2010, we declared and paid a dividend to Liberty Mutual in the form of the February 2010 Note in the aggregate principal amount of $4 billion due February 29, 2012, bearing interest at an annual rate of 0.72%. Prior to the consummation of this offering, we will declare and pay a dividend to Liberty Mutual in the form of the Ohio Casualty Note in the aggregate principal amount of $ billion due , bearing interest at an annual rate of %. Interest We paid $4 million, $25 million and $7 million of interest in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital Lease In 2008, we entered into an arrangement to sell and leaseback certain furniture and equipment. The weighted average interest rate on the lease is 5.23%. The transactions are accounted for as capital leases. As of December 31, 2009, our amortization of the lease obligation under the sale lease back arrangement through maturity is $5 million for 2010, $5 million for 2011, $5 million for 2012, $5 million for 2013 and $1 million for 2014. Line of Credit Agreements We have various revolving loan agreements with Liberty Mutual in the amount of $500 million that expire on May 22, 2011 and $130 million that expire on November 8, 2012. To date, no funds have been borrowed under the facilities. On April 1, 2010, we received approval of our application for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. This membership provides us with access to secured asset-based borrowing with loan maturities up to 20 years. We have board approval for up to $1.2 billion in borrowings. To date, no funds have been borrowed. 108 Table of Contents We intend to enter into a 3-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that will enable us to borrow up to $ million for working capital and general corporate purposes from time to time. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $748 million, an increase of $264 million over the year ended December 31, 2008. Results in 2009 reflected higher reinsurance outflows of $145 million primarily related to the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty, offset by a $73 million receipt of collateral related to a Surety contract. Excluding these transactions, net cash provided by operating activities increased $336 million over 2008 primarily driven by a higher level of net investment income and premium collections compared with 2008. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.345 billion, a decrease of $2.794 billion from the year ended December 31, 2008. Net cash used to purchase and sell securities totaled $1.512 billion in 2009 and $(1.250) billion in 2008, an increase of $2.762 billion. Fixed maturities net purchases accounted for $2.020 billion of the outflow in 2009 and $550 million of an inflow in 2008. These were offset with $308 million of cash inflow from the net sales of equities in 2009 and $644 million in 2008. Further impacting the reduction in net cash flows used in investing activities was the acquisition of Safeco in 2008, which resulted in $5.273 billion of net cash outflow. Financing Activities Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $177 million, a decrease of $4.860 billion from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily resulted from a number of financing activities that occurred in 2008. The 2008 cash provided by financing activity reflected capital contributions of $6.607 billion, the proceeds of which were used for the Safeco acquisition, partially offset by the aforementioned debt financing activity and dividends paid. Dividends paid to stockholder totaled $63 million and $862 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Further impacting the change in cash flows from financing activities in 2009 was the impact of net securities lending activity. Cash from net securities lending activity and other financing activities was $244 million in 2009, an increase of $530 million over 2008 due to an increase in lending activity as credit markets stabilized. Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim adjustment expense related payments. The table does not include any short-term obligations, other than those relating to long term liabilities, and includes only liabilities at December 31, 2009 that are expected to be settled in cash. The amount and estimated future payment schedules of claims and claims related expenses in the table below represent our best estimates utilizing actuarial modeling as of December 31, 2009. The process of estimating ultimate unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses involves considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty is due, in large part, to certain risk factors inherent in both the insurance business and in the estimation process itself. These risk factors can vary by line of business, coverage or business segment. Some risk factors are explicit assumptions of a model, while others are implied by the model or estimation process. For example, future medical inflation might be estimated and explicitly factored into a model, while projected payments might implicitly assume that historical payments are a good predictor or that the legal environment will remain unchanged. For each of the assumptions, explicit or implicit, actual results are likely to vary from expectations, which will cause actual claim payments to vary from those being estimated. Another factor is the time between the occurrence of the claim and the time it is actually reported to us, which may result in a time reporting lag. The cash flow impact related to the items discussed below required estimation of total dollar impact and timing of all payments. 109 Table of Contents The contractual obligations related to long-term debt, operating leases, purchase obligations, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses (gross of the estimated reinsurance recoveries) and other applicable liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Debt $ 37 $  $ 17 $ 20 $  Capital Lease 21 5 10 6  Interest on Debt 12 4 6 2  Total long-term debt obligations(1) 70 9 33 28  Operating Leases(2) 267 41 84 60 82 Estimated claims and claims related payments Claims and claim adjustment expenses(3) 12,053 4,578 4,272 1,707 1,496 Payout from ceded funds withheld(4) 70 18 29 11 12 Sub-total 12,123 4,596 4,301 1,718 1,508 Loss based assessments and guaranty funds 31 14 11 3 3 Liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits(5) 6     Total(6) $ 12,497 $ 4,660 $ 4,429 $ 1,809 $ 1,593 (1) See Note 8  Debt Outstanding to our historical consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2009 the estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis were as follows: Less More than 1 3-5 than 5 Total Year 1-3 Years Years Years (Dollars in millions) Claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 10,757 $ 4,255 $ 3,840 $ 1,459 $ 1,203 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our principal estimates include those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, reinsurance recoverables, investment valuations, and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. Some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results in future periods might differ from these estimates. Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves We are directly liable for claims and claim adjustment expenses under the terms of insurance policies our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates underwrite. Significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurers payment of that loss. Our loss reserves are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets under the line item caption unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. As of December 31, 2009, our reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, gross and net of reinsurance, were $12.1 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively. Our reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, loss reserves, represent managements best estimate of the ultimate cost of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported (which we refer to in this prospectus as our case reserves) and IBNR. IBNR is based on an actuarial estimate of future claim payments beyond those considered in the case reserve estimates, relating to claims arising from accidents that occurred during a particular time period on or prior to the balance sheet date. Thus, IBNR is the compilation of the estimated ultimate losses for each accident year less amounts that have been paid and case reserves. IBNR reserves, unlike case reserves, do not apply to a specific claim, but rather apply to the entire body of claims arising from a specific time period. IBNR primarily provides for costs due to: 1) future claim payments in excess of case reserves on recorded open claims; 2) additional claim payments on closed claims; 3) claims that have been reported but not recorded; and 4) the cost of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent managements best estimate, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. In arriving at managements best estimate, management utilizes actuarial indications in conjunction with their knowledge and judgment about operational and environmental conditions. Management also considers any limitations in the actuarial methodologies and assumptions that may not completely reflect future loss 111 Table of Contents emergence, historical development on immature years, and the historical movement of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense estimates as these years typically mature. Thus, managements best estimate gives consideration to the actuarial indications, including facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability, current known trends and specifics about our underlying insured exposures (size, geography, legal climate), as well as the possible uncertainty not adequately reflected in the actuarial indications. In establishing loss reserves, we also take into account estimated reinsurance recoveries and salvage and subrogation. The process of estimating unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, primarily changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, changes in our underlying insurance exposures as a result of acquisitions, inflation, legal trends and legislative changes. The impact of many of these events on our ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Ultimate claims and claim adjustment expense estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line and business segment due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, and the determination of occurrence dates for claims, as well as reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder insured event and when it is actually reported to us). Our loss reserves are reviewed at least on a quarterly basis by qualified actuaries employed by Liberty Mutual and assigned to our company under services agreements with us. These actuaries will be transferred to us on January 1, 2011 as part of the transfer of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees. We use informed judgment throughout the process, derived from individual experiences and expertise applied to multiple sets of data and analysis. Subsequent to each quarterly review, our actuaries make recommendations to refine managements best estimate for the prospective quarter end. These recommendations in a regular ongoing process each quarter as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. We consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established and new facts and circumstances become known. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of our estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different in amount from our current loss reserves. The amount by which estimated losses measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates, differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development. Reserve development is unfavorable when payments for losses are made for more than the levels at which they were reserved or when subsequent estimates indicate an increase in established reserves. In this case, the previously-estimated loss reserves are considered deficient. Reserve development is favorable when payments for losses are less than the level at which they were previously reserved or when subsequent estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves. In this case, the previously-estimated loss reserves are considered redundant. Reserve development, whether due to an increase or decrease in the aggregate estimated losses, is reflected in our results of operations through an adjustment to incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses during the accounting period in which the development is recognized. As used in this  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves section, unless the context otherwise requires, changes in loss reserve estimates that are expressed as negative percentages or numbers refer to favorable changes in reserves (reflecting reserve redundancies) and changes in loss reserve estimates that are expressed as positive percentages or numbers refer to unfavorable changes in reserves (reflecting reserve deficiencies). A portion of our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are for A&E claims and related litigation, which totaled, gross and net of reinsurance, $474 million and $407 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. While our ongoing review of A&E claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability, and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, our management believes that it is possible that the significant uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount 112 Table of Contents that could be material to our future operating results. See  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves  Corporate and Other  Run-Off Operations  Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. We, like other insurance companies, categorize and track our loss reserves by product line. We also regularly review the appropriateness of our loss reserves at each of our four segments: Commercial, Personal, Surety and Corporate and Other. At December 31, 2009, Commercial consisted mainly of ongoing commercial lines exposure and made up approximately 61% of the entire claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at that date. Personal accounted for approximately 21% of such reserves at that date, approximately 15% of such reserves were attributable to Corporate and Other segment, and Surety reserves accounted for the remaining 3%. Our gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by business segment and product line at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: At December 31, 2009 2008 Case IBNR Total Case IBNR Total (Dollars in millions) Commercial Commercial multiple peril $ 986 $ 1,212 $ 2,198 $ 1,072 $ 1,246 $ 2,318 Commercial automobile 605 538 1,143 685 514 1,199 Workers compensation 1,886 1,093 2,979 1,819 1,196 3,015 General liability 332 581 913 328 721 1,049 Other 58 28 86 77 32 109 Subtotal 3,867 3,452 7,319 3,981 3,709 7,690 Personal Private passenger automobile 1,457 564 2,021 1,430 637 2,067 Homeowners 202 153 355 269 162 431 Other 98 113 211 110 108 218 Subtotal 1,757 830 2,587 1,809 907 2,716 Surety (42 ) 432 390 (6 ) 342 336 Corporate and Other 1,049 708 1,757 1,191 718 1,909 Total $ 6,631 $ 5,422 $ 12,053 $ 6,975 $ 5,676 $ 12,651 The $598 million decline in total gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 primarily reflected favorable prior year reserve development during 2009. The main drivers of this favorable prior year development were favorable frequency and benign severity trends that were better than anticipated in the following product lines: commercial general liability, private passenger automobile, commercial multiple peril, and workers compensation. Included in our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are certain reserves discounted to the present value of estimated future payments. In 2009, we changed our method of accounting for the discounting of the long-term indemnity portion of workers compensation claims from tabular discount rates based on insurance regulations as approved by the respective jurisdictions to risk-free discount rates determined by reference to interest rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The liabilities for losses for most long-term disability payments arising from our workers compensation product line were discounted at risk-free rates in effect when the losses were incurred. Those rates were 3.7%, 4.0% and 4.8% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The average weighted discount rate for the entire reserve portfolio was 5.9% at December 31, 2009. We applied this change in method by retrospective application to the prior years financial statements. We believe that the use of a risk-free discount rate is more reflective of market rates being earned on the assets supporting the respective liabilities and is therefore preferable to use rather than the imposed regulatory discount rates. 113 Table of Contents The cumulative effect of the change in the method of accounting resulted in an increase in the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 of $20 million, net of tax. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, the accounting change resulted in decreases in reinsurance recoverables, deferred income tax liability, and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of $8 million, $14 million and $48 million, respectively, and an increase in retained earnings of $26 million and no impact to claims and claim adjustment expenses, income tax expenses and net loss. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2008, the accounting change resulted in the following changes to previous balances: decreases in reinsurance recoverables, deferred income tax liability and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of $9 million, $14 million, and $49 million, respectively, and increases in retained earnings, claims and claim adjustment expenses, income tax expense and net income of $26 million, $6 million, $2 million and $4 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the accounting change resulted in the following changes to previously reported balances: decreases in claims and claim adjustment expense, income tax expense and net income of $3 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively. See Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses to our historical consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of the discount was $175 million and $177 million, respectively. See  Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Commercial  Workers Compensation for a further discussion of our reserving for our workers compensation product line. The following table presents the overall prior year development in our loss reserves for the three years ended December 31, 2009 by accident year: (Favorable) Unfavorable Development Year Ended December 31, Accident Year 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) 2008 $ (326 ) 2007 (399 ) $ (141 ) 2006 (122 ) (126 ) $ (65 ) 2005 (63 ) (28 ) (159 ) 2004 (60 ) (26 ) (134 ) 2003 (15 ) (32 ) 19 2002 27 (28 ) (23 ) 2001 40 (40 ) 14 2000 26 (34 ) 3 1999 and prior 190 (37 ) 33 All Years $ (702 ) $ (492 ) $ (312 ) The net favorable development in our loss reserves of $702 million in 2009 was related to multiple factors. The most significant of these were:  We experienced favorable development of about $305 million in our commercial general liability line in 2009. This determination was primarily attributable to a detailed review we conducted in 2009 of this line of business by product type. In particular we reviewed umbrella coverages separate from non-umbrella general liability coverages to reflect the distinct patterns in reporting and settlement of these claims. Losses in this line continued to emerge more favorably than expected in accident years 2003 through 2008.  We experienced favorable development in our private passenger automobile liability line of $160 million in 2009. This improvement was driven by results in 2007 and 2008, and was primarily attributable to 114 Table of Contents frequency of losses in this line continuing to be lower than previously expected, coupled with moderate severity trends. We also have seen loss emergence well below expected levels due in part to economic and other environmental conditions that impacted driver behavior during late 2007 and through 2008.  We experienced favorable development in our commercial multiple peril line of $121 million during 2009. Much of this development was attributable to paid and reported claims on the commercial liability coverages emerging below expected amounts. The favorable development was most evident in accident years 2006 through 2008.  We experienced favorable development in our surety business of $58 million during 2009. Given the inherent volatility in this line, we continue to rely on long-term averages to project and plan losses. Loss emergence in the 2009 year was materially better than expected, resulting in this improvement primarily on 2007 and 2008 accident years.  We experienced favorable development in our commercial automobile liability line of $41 million in 2009. Losses on this line continue to emerge more favorably than expectations on the most recent accident years. This favorable emergence was primarily driven by development in the 2008 accident year as a result of frequency and severity trends emerging better than expected. The net favorable loss development in our loss reserves of $492 million in 2008 was related to multiple factors. The most significant of these were:  We experienced favorable development of $194 million in our commercial general liability line for 2008. This result was primarily driven by umbrella coverage where, given the volatile nature of the line, long-term history helps inform the more recent year projections. Losses emerged on this line in 2008 at levels below the long-term average, and below expected levels resulting in favorable development primarily in accident years 2005 through 2007.  We experienced favorable development of $165 million in our commercial multiple peril line for 2008. This development emerged across accident years 2000 through 2008, and was driven by both paid and incurred losses emerging well below expected amounts due to better than expected frequency trends.  We experienced favorable development of $64 million for 2008 in our commercial automobile liability line across multiple accident years, but primarily driven by improvement in the 2006 and 2007 accident years due to better than expected emergence of frequency and severity trends.  We experienced favorable development of $43 million in our private passenger automobile liability line in 2008. This emergency was evident across multiple accident years and was attributable to continued favorable frequency and moderate severity trends.  We experienced $18 million of favorable development in our surety business in 2008. Given the inherent volatility of this line, we continue to rely on long-term averages to project and plan losses. Loss emergence in 2008 was better than the long-term average across multiple accident years. The net favorable development in our loss reserves of $312 million in 2007 was related to multiple factors. The most significant of these were:  We experienced favorable development in our commercial automobile line of $85 million in 2007. This development emerged across multiple accident years, primarily driven by 2002 through 2006, and was attributable to better than expected frequency trends.  We experienced favorable development of $119 million in our commercial multiple peril line in 2007. This development was most pronounced on accident years 2004 and 2005, driven by better than expected frequency and severity trends.  We experienced favorable development of $46 million in our workers compensation line in 2007. Workers compensation development was primarily attributable to medical severity trends on paid claims emerging at more favorable levels than planned. In estimating losses in this product line, we consider a 115 Table of Contents long-term view of medical severity and medical inflation. These trends emerged favorably in 2007 on the accident years prior to 2007.  We experienced favorable development of $9 million in our homeowners line in 2007. This emergence was driven by better than expected loss emergence on property coverage for the 2006 accident year, emerging during the first quarter of 2007. The loss development detailed above demonstrates the uncertainty inherent in the estimation of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The reserve development shown in the ten year calendar period in Business  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves  Reserves Held also demonstrates this variability. It is important to note that the trends and emergence seen in past years will not necessarily persist into the future. Reserves are set at managements best estimate of the ultimate liabilities, and it is not appropriate to project or extrapolate past reserve development into future calendar periods. General discussion Our process for estimating reserves for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claims adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics and evaluated by our actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by category. These categories are typically grouped by product line or coverage and by business segment. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a given component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. We use multiple estimation methods in our analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all reserve lines. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated. In the case of most of our product lines and business segments, we utilize multiple methods for each analysis. Property casualty insurance policies are written either on a claims-made or on an occurrence basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. Policies written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later. Most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of our reserve development in A&E exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation and judicial interpretations, among others. A basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that historical data and past patterns demonstrated in the historical data form a reasonable basis upon which to project future outcomes, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. Throughout the process of estimating unpaid claim liabilities, our management relies on the informed judgment of our actuaries performing the analysis as well as other professionals within our organization. It is typical for our actuaries to meet with underwriting and product teams during the analysis to better understand issues in the marketplace such as competition and price pressures, changes in terms and conditions and 116 Table of Contents changes in the mix of business. It is also typical for our actuaries to meet with members of our claims management to better understand claims trends, coverage issues, actions being taken within the claims function, and any other issues which may potentially affect claim payments or data. During times of significant change within our organization, such as an acquisition, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more critical to the process, and at the same time becomes more complicated or difficult to apply. The variables noted below in this general discussion have different impacts on the amount of uncertainty in the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expenses. This uncertainty can be impacted by the estimation uncertainty for specific product lines, how long the claim stays open, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. Product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event that triggers claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation uncertainty. The longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. A major component of the claim uncertainty is the reporting lag. A long reporting lag, which is the time between the event that triggers a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. For some product lines, such as surety or commercial umbrella, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being low frequency/high severity, while product lines without this large claim characteristic are referred to as high frequency/low severity. Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims. As a result, the range of reasonable reserve estimates tends to be wider and the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines, the impact of individual claims is relatively minor in the analysis and the range of reasonable reserve estimates tends to be narrower and more stable. Claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. Actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and the context in which they are reviewing the reserves. Hence, the estimates selected by different actuaries may differ materially from each other. Lastly, significant changes in the organizational structure of a company can have a material impact on the availability and reliability of data. Other significant changes, such as acquisitions, changes in underwriting or claims technology and changes in product mix, all impact our company to some degree. Our internal actuarial function includes systems and business people dedicated to creating uniform and consistent historical data sets across multiple systems. However, significant structural changes increase the inherent uncertainty of reserving for claims and claim adjustment expenses until stable trends re-establish themselves. Risk Factors Inherent in the Estimation of Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses The process of estimating loss reserves involves considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty is due, in large part, to certain risk factors inherent in both the insurance business and in the estimation process itself. These risk factors can vary by product line, coverage type or business segment. Some risk factors are explicit assumptions of an estimation model, while others are implied by the model or estimation process. For example, future medical inflation might be estimated and explicitly factored into a model, while projected payments might implicitly assume that historical payments are a good predictor or that the legal environment 117 Table of Contents will remain unchanged. For each of the assumptions, explicit or implicit, actual results are likely to vary from expectations which will cause actual claim payments to vary from those being estimated. Actual results will likely vary from expectations, for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to differ in amount from the reserves being established currently. Some risk factors will affect more than one product line or business segment. Examples include changes in practices of our claims organization, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, location of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product lines or business segments. The effect of a particular risk on estimates of reserves for claims and claim adjustment expenses cannot be isolated in most cases. The estimation process also involves analysis of large sets of historical data which can be subject to distortion from environmental events or internal structural shifts. It is not always possible to understand the impact of these shifts on the data or analysis at the time when they occur. For example, a new training program for claims adjusters can impact the relative level at which claims are reserved or even settled, making historical data less predictive. Another example is when a state reforms its laws pertaining to workers compensation medical benefits, but the ultimate effect of that change on payments may not be fully understood for several years. Sudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable. Actuarial Methods for Analyzing and Estimating Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves We estimate ultimate unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses (which we refer to in this section as the ultimate) by product line and by accident year. For purposes of analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time, we compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year or quarter in which the claim occurred (accident year or accident quarter), since each such group of claims is at a different stage of progression toward the ultimate resolution and payment of those claims. We subtract the current case reserve incurred amounts from the ultimate to produce our estimate of the IBNR reserves. The IBNR reserve provides for unreported claims, development on reported claims, and reopened claims. We typically use at least four methods in our estimate of ultimate unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. An ultimate is selected from the methods for the accident year in each segment. The final selected ultimate for each segment is based on particular methods. The relative degree to which one method is relied on over another is a matter of judgment and the particular line under review. The following is a description of the principal actuarial estimation methods that we use: 1. Paid Loss Development Method. The paid loss development method uses historical, cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years, adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claims environment and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data. 2. Reported Loss Development Method. The reported loss development method uses historical, cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years, adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claims environment and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data. 118 Table of Contents 3. Bornhuetter-Ferguson Paid Method. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson paid method assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses. The weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures. 4. Bornhuetter-Ferguson Reported Method. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported method assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars (paid losses plus case reserves). The weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures. While these are the principal actuarial estimation methods that we use, our actuaries evaluating a particular component of the loss reserves for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the property casualty actuarial profession. Our actuaries are also continually monitoring developments for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates, including the application of stochastic models. The results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including paid-to-incurred loss ratios, implied incurred-loss-to-net premiums earned ratios, indicated IBNR to net premiums earned, and implied claim severity trends. An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development based on the prior review. Calendar year trends are also examined to determine if there have been changes to the relative level of case reserve adequacy. Additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods. The methods described above rely on historical data. For the current accident year that data is not initially available. Initial estimates typically rely on projected loss ratios applied to current net premiums earned. Projected ratios are derived through a loss ratio roll forward methodology. This methodology utilizes historical loss ratios, and trends them forward to the current year using frequency, severity, exposure, and price trend assumptions. We also consider large loss trends and catastrophes, as well as change to underwriting practices, mix of business, and any other items that might reasonably have an effect on prospective losses. As data becomes available as the current year matures, that data is reviewed in conjunction with the projected loss ratios to derive our estimates. Quarterly Reserve Review Process Our actuarial group prepares an analysis each quarter of our estimates of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense liabilities. As part of this analysis, our reserving group meets with our underwriting, claims and field actuarial staff to discuss data, losses and loss trends, and any operational issues that could potentially affect ultimate claims or data used to estimate ultimate unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The reserving group also meets with our management team and the management of our three operating segments as part of the process to review preliminary indications and to discuss indicated trends. Consolidated final results are then presented to our reserve committee. This committee is made up of our president and chief executive officer, chief financial officer, head of claims, and the head of each of our three operating segments, as well as our chief actuary and reserving actuaries. These meetings focus on loss trends and material changes in the quarter. Each member of our reserve committee brings his or her own perspective of the operations to this discussion, which allows the group to understand changes and trends in context. Based on these discussions, we may also determine that certain issues warrant further review and analysis based on feedback from the group. An important end product of the analysis of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is the derivation of measures of uncertainty in the estimation of ultimate unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. This uncertainty is presented in terms of ranges, both ranges of reserve estimates, and ranges of outcomes. Ranges of insurance outcomes are generally based on skewed distributions since the given probable outcomes can generally vary more on the high side than on the low side. All of this information and analysis helps management to ultimately determine their prospective best estimate for reserves. 119 Table of Contents At the conclusion of each reserve committee meeting, recommendations are made to determine managements best estimate for the prospective quarter-end. Any changes to overall reserves, once agreed to, are reviewed again just prior to quarter end to determine if any subsequent events would change the final recommendations. The final reserves recorded by management in a reporting period reflect the detailed analysis of past data, managements judgment about trends, and considerations of inherent variability in the reserve estimate. Management also takes into account items that may not be reflected in the data discussed above, as well as data and information made available subsequent to the review but prior to the end of the prospective financial period. Discussion of Reserve Considerations by Operating Segments and Product Lines The following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by operating segment and product line. There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For example, in workers compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation. In order to provide information on possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end loss reserves over a ten-year period are reviewed and are provided for our product lines. This information is provided for both us and the property casualty industry for the ten most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual line being discussed. These changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in Schedule P of those statements and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, and excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. This treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P of the statutory annual statement for each of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates. Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Commercial The main product lines within our Commercial segment are commercial multiple peril (excluding A&E), commercial automobile, workers compensation, general liability, and other. Other consists primarily of inland marine, farmowners multiple peril, allied lines, and fire product lines. Commercial Multiple Peril (excluding A&E) Commercial multiple peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typical for small businesses and therefore includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for liability coverages it takes a longer period of time to close claims. Because of the different characteristics of the components, reserve analysis is typically done for these coverages separately. The reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. The reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the policyholder. Commercial multiple peril is generally sold to smaller accounts, while the policyholder profile for general liability and property coverages generally includes larger policyholders. See  General Liability (excluding A&E)  General liability external risk factors,  General Liability (excluding A&E)  General liability operational risk factors,  Commercial  Other risk factors affecting other product lines and  Commercial  Other  Other operational risk factors, in each case discussed below, with regard to reserving risk for the commercial multiple peril product line. Commercial multiple peril combines general liability and property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines. 120 Table of Contents Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase (decrease) in the commercial multiple peril incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $26 million, or 1.2%, increase (decrease) in loss reserves. The one-year change in the reserve estimate for the commercial multiple peril product line over the period of 1999 through 2008 has varied from 9.8% to -10.3% (averaging 0.2%) for us, and from 5.0% to -5.0% (averaging 1.1%) for the property casualty industry overall. Our year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Commercial multiple peril reserves represented approximately 18.2% of our total loss reserves at December 31, 2009. Our change in reserve estimate for the commercial multiple peril product line was -5.5% for 2009, -10.3% for 2008 and -7.1% for 2007. The favorable result in 2009 was attributable to a number of factors including actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected, moderate severity, and actual emerged trends developing more favorably than initial estimates. The favorable development was driven by changes in estimates across multiple accident years. Changes in prior year estimates can often have a leveraged effect on more current estimates which may be based on prior year estimates. Commercial Automobile The commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and therefore includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to automobile physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not significant, and the line is viewed as high frequency, with low to moderate severity. Commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in components: commercial automobile liability, which includes bodily injury liability and property damage liability, as well as medical costs; and commercial automobile property, which includes collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components present minimal reserve risk given their shorttail nature and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented below. We utilize the traditional actuarial methods mentioned in the discussion above under  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves Actuarial Methods for Analyzing and Estimating Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves in estimating loss reserves for this line. This is supplemented with detailed custom analyses where needed. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof that could change and thus affect our commercial automobile loss reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section above) include: Commercial Automobile liability external risk factors  Trends in jury awards  Changes in case law  Litigation trends  Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits  Change in average severity of accidents or proportion of severe accidents  Changes in vehicle safety technology  Subrogation opportunities  Changes in claim handling philosophies  Frequency of visits to health providers  Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers 121 Table of Contents  Types of health providers used  Types of medical treatments received  Changes in cost of medical treatments  Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Commercial Automobile operational risk factors  Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.)  Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets)  Changes in underwriting standards Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase (decrease) in the commercial automobile incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $14 million, or 1.2%, increase (decrease) in loss reserves. The one-year change in the reserve estimate for the commercial automobile product line over the period of 1999 through 2008, has varied from 24.3% to -17.5% (averaging 0.2%) for us, and from 8.4% to -2.9% (averaging 1.9%) for the industry overall. Our year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Commercial automobile loss reserves represented approximately 9.5% of our total loss reserves at December 31, 2009. Our change in reserve estimate for the commercial automobile product line was -3.9% for 2009, -9.8% for 2008 and -17.5% for 2007. The favorable result for 2009 was attributable to a number of factors including: actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected, moderate long-term severity on paid claims, and frequency trends at or near zero. Workers Compensation Workers compensation insurance coverage is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured workers life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a workers injury. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk. Workers compensation loss reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses. Where jurisdictional issues such as benefit levels and regulations around settlement of claims are relevant, we review these factors by jurisdiction or groups of jurisdictions. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus affect our workers compensation loss reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section above) include: Indemnity risk factors  Time required to recover from the injury  Degree of available transitional jobs  Degree of legal involvement 122 Table of Contents  Changes in the interpretations and processes of state workers compensation commissions oversight of claims (these are administrative bodies that evaluate whether or not a given claim for workers compensation benefits is valid)  Future wage inflation for states that index benefits  Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds Medical risk factors  Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules (medical inflation)  Changes in need for attendant care  Frequency of visits to health providers  Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers  Types of health providers used  Type of medical treatments received  Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices  Availability of new medical processes, equipment and drugs  Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs  Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment General workers compensation risk factors  Frequency of claim reopening on claims previously closed  Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment  Degree of cost shifting between workers compensation and private/group health insurance Workers compensation operational risk factors  Product mix  Injury type mix  Changes in underwriting standards Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase (decrease) in the workers compensation incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $36 million, or 1.2%, increase (decrease) in loss reserves. The one-year change in the reserve estimate for the workers compensation product line over the period of 1999  2008, has varied from 19.3% to -6.0% (averaging 2.9%) for us, and from 4.2% to -2.0% (averaging 1.1%) for the property casualty industry overall. Our year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Workers compensation reserves represented approximately 24.7% of our total loss reserves at December 31, 2009. Our change in reserve estimate for this product line was -0.5% for 2009, 1.9% for 2008 and -3.9% for 2007. The favorable change for 2009 was primarily driven by prior year losses emerging at levels below expectations. For workers compensation, key drivers of lower estimates have included: impact of state reforms on medical costs, and continued favorable frequency trends on claims. The liabilities for losses for most long-term disability payments under workers compensation insurance were discounted at risk free rates in effect when the losses were incurred. See Note 1  Nature of Operations 123 Table of Contents and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses to our historical consolidated financial statements. General Liability (excluding A&E) Commercial general liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within 5 to 7 years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or more for construction defect claims). While the majority of general liability coverages are written on an occurrence basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability) are typically insured on a claims-made basis. These are not material to the overall reserves. General liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components, one for primary or general liability excluding umbrella, and another for excess/umbrella. Defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some policies this risk is mitigated by language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limits available to pay the claim. Such defense within the limits policies are most common for claims-made products. When defense costs are outside of the limits, amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits. The general liability product line is typically one of our largest source of reserve estimate uncertainties. Major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag, the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the event that triggers coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure). The amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues include construction defect and other mass tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics. In addition to the traditional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section above, we utilize various report year development and other methods for the construction defect components of this product line. For components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, we rely more heavily on the Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods than on the paid loss and reported loss development methods. 124 Table of Contents Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and thus affect our general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section above) include: General liability external risk factors  Changes in claim handling philosophies  Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions  New theories of liability  Trends in jury awards  Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues  Changes in statutes of limitations  Changes in the underlying court system  Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues  Changes in tort law  Shifts in law suit mix between federal and state courts  Changes in claims adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data)  Changes in settlement patterns (e.g., medical malpractice) General liability operational risk factors  Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)  Changes in underwriting standards  Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase/(decrease) in the general liability incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $15 million, or 1.6%, increase/(decrease) in loss reserves. The one-year change in the reserve estimate for the general liability product line, over the period of 1999 through 2008, has varied from 2.9% to -23.3% (averaging -11.4%) for us and from 11.9% to -1.1% (averaging 3.9%) for the property casualty industry overall. Our year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. General liability reserves represented approximately 7.6% of our total loss reserves at December 31, 2009. Our change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated A&E amounts, was -25.7% for 2009, -23.3% for 2008 and -7.2% for 2007. The 2009 change primarily reflected significant favorable prior year reserve development, driven by several factors, including moderate severity and favorable frequency trends. Commercial  Other As mentioned above, Commercial-other primarily consists of property-related coverages, such as inland marine, farmowners multiple peril, allied lines, and fire product lines. These lines are generally considered short tail with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). They are viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for other lines coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk. 125 Table of Contents Our other product lines reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect our other product lines reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section above) include: Risk factors affecting other product lines  Physical concentration of policyholders  Availability and cost of local contractors  For the more severe catastrophic events, demand surge inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services  Local building codes  Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims)  Court interpretation of policy provisions (e.g., occurrence definition, wind versus flooding)  Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake)  Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations Other operational risk factors  Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)  Changes in underwriting standards Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase/(decrease) in the other incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $1 million, or 1.2%, increase/(decrease) in loss reserves, respectively. The one-year change in the reserve estimate for our other product lines over the period of 1999 through 2008, has varied from 52.8% to -138.1% (averaging -8.9%) for us, and from 4.8% to -11.9% (averaging -3.7%) for the property casualty industry overall. Our year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Reserves for our other product lines represented an immaterial amount of our total loss reserves at December 31, 2009. While the other product lines are generally considered short tail, the one year change for these lines can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for the other product lines relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to the other product lines because weather related events concentrated in the second half of the year generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. The reserve estimates for these product lines are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for unprecedented significant catastrophes such as the events of Hurricanes Katrina and Ike. Our change in reserve estimate for this product line was 2.6% for 2009, 10.9% for 2008 and 0.8% for 2007. The result for 2009 was primarily driven by unexpected development around 2008 catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather events occurring in the last quarter of 2008. Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Personal The main product lines within our Personal segment are private passenger automobile, homeowners, and other. Other consists primarily of general liability, inland marine, allied lines, and fire. 126 Table of Contents Private Passenger Automobile Private passenger automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made typically pertain to automobile physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. Personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof that could change and thus affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section above) include: Bodily injury and property damage liability risk factors  Trends in jury awards  Changes in the underlying court system  Changes in case law  Litigation trends  Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits  Change in average severity of accidents or proportion of severe accidents  Subrogation opportunities  Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment  Changes in claim handling philosophies Personal automobile operational risk factors  Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.)  Changes in underwriting standards  Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase/(decrease) in the personal automobile incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $22 million, or 1.1%, increase/(decrease) in loss reserves, respectively. The one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the period of 1999 through 2008 has varied from 3.1% to -14.9% (averaging -4.6%) for us, and from -1.2% to -6.4% (averaging -3.8%) for the property casualty industry overall. Our year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Personal automobile loss reserves represented approximately 16.8% of our total loss reserves at December 31, 2009. Our change in reserve estimate for the personal automobile product line was -9.1% for 2009, -9.4% for 2008 and -14.9% for 2007. The favorable result for 2009 was primarily driven by improved estimates on prior year personal automobile liability, more specifically automobile bodily injury. These improved estimates were in turn driven by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends across multiple evaluations. This is consistent with industry trends over the most recent years. 127 Table of Contents Homeowners Homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. The claim is settled when the two parties agree on the amount due in accordance with the policy contract language and the appropriate payment is made (or alternatively, the property replacement/repair is performed by the insurer). The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist. The liability portion of homeowners policies generate claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. In addition, reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future. Overall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity. Homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and thus affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Non-catastrophe risk factors  Salvage opportunities  Amount of time to return property to residential use  Changes in weather patterns  Local building codes  Litigation trends  Trends in jury awards Catastrophe risk factors  Physical concentration of policyholders  Availability and cost of local contractors  Local building codes  Quality of construction of damaged homes  Amount of time to return property to residential use  For the more severe catastrophic events, demand surge inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services Homeowners operational risk factors  Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.)  Degree of concentration of policyholders  Changes in underwriting standards  Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting 128 Table of Contents Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase/(decrease) in the homeowners incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $4 million, or 1.0%, increase/(decrease) in loss reserves, respectively. Historically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for the homeowners product line over the period of 1999 through 2008, has varied from 6.5% to -12.0% (averaging -3.9%) for us, and from 9.9% to -8.6% (averaging 1.9%) for the property casualty industry overall. Our year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Homeowners and personal lines other reserves represented approximately 2.9% of our total loss reserves at December 31, 2009. This line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. Our change in reserve estimate for the homeowners product line was -1.0% for 2009, -5.1% for 2008 and -10.7% for 2007. The 2009 result was primarily attributable to adverse development on 2008 catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses that emerged during the first quarter of 2009. Personal Other As mentioned above, personal lines other consists primarily of general liability, inland marine, allied lines, and fire. Reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and thus affect the required homeowners loss reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Risk factors affecting personal lines other product lines  Salvage opportunities  Amount of time to return property to residential use  Changes in weather patterns  Local building codes  Litigation trends  Trends in jury awards  Physical concentration of policyholders  Availability and cost of local contractors  Local building codes  Quality of construction of damaged homes  Amount of time to return property to residential use  Adequacy of stolen jewelry replacement  Valuation of antiques and other unique properties Personal other operational risk factors  Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) 129 Table of Contents  Degree of concentration of policyholders  Changes in underwriting standards  Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase (decrease) in the personal lines other incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $3 million, or 1.5%, increase (decrease) in loss reserves. Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Surety Surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured. (Large construction projects can take many years to complete.) The frequency of losses in surety correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability to perform financially. The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed of an insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insureds assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and thus affect the required surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section above) include: Surety risk factors  Economic trends, including the general level of construction activity  Concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims  Type of business insured  Type of obligation insured  Cumulative limits of liability for insured  Assets available to mitigate loss  Defective workmanship/latent defects  Financial strategy of insured  Changes in statutory obligations  Geographic spread of business Surety operational risk factors  Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, limits, endorsements)  Changes in underwriting standards Unexpected changes in risk factors can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase/(decrease) in surety incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar year period could lead to a $5 million, or 1.4%, increase/(decrease) in loss reserves, respectively. 130 Table of Contents The one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the period of 1999 through 2008 has varied from 90.4% to -56.8% (averaging 6.9%) for us, and from 21.5% to -13.1% (averaging 3.2%) for the property casualty industry overall. Our year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Surety reserves represented approximately 3.2% of our total loss reserves at December 31, 2009. In general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) and collected salvage are the primary sources of changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Our change in reserve estimate for this product line was -16.6% for 2009, -9.6% for 2008 and 90.4% for 2007. Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Corporate and Other The Corporate and Other segments unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses include balances related to our Reinsurance Operations and our Run-Off Operations at December 31, 2009 and 2008 as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (dollars in millions) Reinsurance Operations $ 489 $ 525 Run-Off Operations 1,268 1,384 Total Corporate and Other $ 1,757 $ 1,909 Reinsurance Operations The unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses held within Corporate and Other, Reinsurance Operations, include reserves attributable to external reinsurance and to assumed inter-segment reinsurance arrangements and other affiliated assumed reinsurance. For a discussion of inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, see  Overview  Inter-Segment Revenue and Expenses. Run-Off Operations Our Run-Off Operations represent liabilities acquired solely through our acquisitions that were considered run-off by the acquired entity, as well as insurance coverages that we no longer offer. These run-off operations include reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, and other liabilities, collectively referred to in this prospectus as our Run-Off Reserves. The Run-Off Reserves at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (dollars in millions) A&E $ 474 $ 516 Safeco Commercial Insurance Run-Off Block 409 456 Ohio Casualty Great American Run-Off Block 71 79 Safeco Assumed Reinsurance 161 148 Other Run-Off 153 185 Total Reserves 1,268 1,384 Other Assumed Run-Off Liabilities 113 127 Reinsurance recoverables (330 ) (349 ) Total Run-Off Reserves $ 1,051 $ 1,162 131 Table of Contents Our Run-Off Operations currently consist of the following: 1. A&E liability originating on the former Safeco, Ohio Casualty and Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE) operations. See  Asbestos and Environmental Reserves below. 2. Reserves originating from the former Safeco Commercial Insurance business that we acquired in 2008. See  Safeco Commercial Insurance Run-Off Block below. 3. Reserves originating from former Ohio Casualty business that it acquired from Great American Insurance Company. See  Ohio Casualty  Great American Insurance Run-Off Block below. 4. Reserves originating from Safecos acquisition of American Union Reinsurance Companys assumed reinsurance business. See  Safeco Assumed Reinsurance below. 5. Reserves from other run-off operations. See  Other Run-Off below. 6. Other liabilities including assumed run-off liabilities originating from former Ohio Casualty business that we acquired from Great American Insurance Company- See  Ohio Casualty  Great American Insurance Run-Off Block below. 7. Reinsurance recoverables related to the above mentioned reserves. We will pay Liberty Mutual a one-time payment of $125 million and Liberty Mutual will indemnify us for up to $500 million of adverse development in our Run-Off Reserves. Liberty Mutuals indemnification will cover both adverse development with respect to such reserves and other liabilities, including any failure to fully realize such reinsurance recoverables whether due to coverage disputes or inability to pay. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves We have exposure to A&E claims that emanate principally from general liability policies written prior to the mid-1980s. In establishing our A&E reserves, we estimate case reserves for anticipated losses and bulk reserves for claim adjustment expenses and IBNR claims reserves. We maintained casualty excess of loss reinsurance during the relevant periods. The reserves are reported net of cessions to reinsurers and include any reserves reported by ceding reinsurers on assumed reinsurance contracts. The process of establishing reserves for A&E claims is subject to greater uncertainty than the establishment of reserves for liabilities relating to other types of insurance claims. A number of factors contribute to this greater uncertainty, including, without limitation: (i) the lack of available and reliable historical claims data as an indicator of future loss development, (ii) the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage, (iii) the difficulty in identifying the source of asbestos or environmental contamination, (iv) the difficulty in properly allocating liability for asbestos or environmental damage, (v) the uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, (vi) the cost to resolve claims, and (vii) the collectability of reinsurance. The uncertainties associated with establishing reserves for A&E claims and claim adjustment expenses are compounded by the differing, and at times inconsistent, court rulings on A&E coverage issues involving: (i) the differing interpretations of various insurance policy provisions and whether A&E losses are or were ever intended to be covered, (ii) when a loss occurred and what policies potentially provide coverage, (iii) whether there is an insured obligation to defend, (iv) whether a compensable loss or injury has occurred, (v) how policy limits are determined, (vi) how policy exclusions are applied and interpreted, (vii) the impact of entities seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, (viii) whether clean-up costs are covered as insured property damage, and (ix) applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products or completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. The uncertainties cannot be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on our future operating results and financial condition. In the last few years we, as well as the industry generally, have seen decreases in the number of asbestos claims being filed. This turn to a more favorable trend is due to a number of factors. Screening activity used by some lawyers to find new plaintiffs has been largely eliminated as a result of questionable practices 132 Table of Contents discovered in the Federal Silica Multi-District Litigation. Court decisions in several key states (e.g., Mississippi) have been favorable to defendants. Most importantly, several states have enacted legislation in the past few years that contain medical criteria provisions aimed at reducing the number of lawsuits filed by unimpaired plaintiffs and providing prompt and fair compensation to those who meet the criteria. The majority of the liabilities underlying the reserves for A&E liabilities originated from three distinct sources: legacy business originally written within the former Safeco operations, legacy business originally written within the former Ohio Casualty operations, and legacy business originating from the former GRE operations. Our A&E reserves are reviewed biennially by our multi-disciplined team of internal claims, legal, reinsurance and actuarial personnel. Each legacy line of business was reviewed upon its acquisition by Liberty Mutual, and they have been reviewed biennially thereafter by Liberty Mutuals actuaries dedicated to us under services agreements with us. These actuaries will be transferred to us in January 2011 as part of the transfer to us by Liberty Mutual of employees dedicated to our business. Once these reviews are completed, reserves are reconciled to the estimates for ultimate unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. Various benchmarks such as average payments, survival ratios, payments on known claims and newly reported claims are reviewed periodically to ensure held reserve balances remain reasonable. During 2007, we performed a detailed study of our exposure for A&E liabilities. The result of this study was an indicated reserve decrease of $2 million on asbestos gross of reinsurance and, $0 million on a net basis. For environmental, the study indicated a reserve increase to environmental reserves of $45 million on a gross basis and $49 million on a net basis. Both of these amounts were recorded in 2007. In addition to these changes we also added reserves for A&E liabilities from the former Ohio Casualty operations to our balance sheet for 2007. During 2008, we performed a detailed study of the A&E liabilities from the former Ohio Casualty operations. The result of this study was an indicated increase to asbestos of $4 million gross of reinsurance and $6 million net of reinsurance. For environmental, the study indicated an increase to gross reserves of $2 million and a decrease to net reserves of $5 million. These amounts were recorded in 2008. In addition to these changes we also added reserves for A&E liabilities from the former Safeco operations. During 2009, we performed a detailed study of our exposure for A&E liabilities which included the exposures acquired from the former Ohio Casualty and the former Safeco operations. As a result of this study, asbestos reserves were decreased by $8 million gross of reinsurance, and increased by $5 million on a net basis (which includes the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance on unpaid losses). For environmental liabilities, we increased reserves by $9 million gross of reinsurance, and $6 million on a net basis, in accordance with our latest indications. These amounts were recorded in 2009. As a result of the significant uncertainty inherent in determining a companys A&E liabilities and establishing related reserves, the amount of reserves required to adequately fund our A&E claims and claim adjustment expenses cannot be accurately estimated using conventional reserving methodologies based on historical data and trends. As a result, the use of conventional reserving methodologies frequently has to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. In that regard, the estimation of asbestos claims and associated liabilities and the analysis of environmental claims considered prevailing applicable law and certain inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability, and the risks inherent in major litigation and other uncertainties. We believe that in future periods it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding A&E related claims could result in an aggregate liability that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to our future operating results and financial condition. 133 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our A&E reserves for claims and claim adjustment expenses at December 31, 2009, gross and net of reinsurance: Direct Assumed Ceded (1) Net (Dollars in millions) Asbestos $ 156 $ 158 $ (47 ) $ 267 Environmental 136 24 (20 ) 140 Total $ 292 (1) $ 182 $ (67 ) $ 407 (1) The ceded A&E reserves exclude an allowance of $8 million. Asbestos Liability Exposure Two separate special claims-handling units within the Complex & Emerging Risks Claims Department, which we refer to in this prospectus as CERC, of Liberty Mutual handle our asbestos liabilities: one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our run-off assumed reinsurance operations and another that specializes in asbestos claims related to our direct exposure. Former Safeco Operations The former Safeco operations asbestos exposure emanates from three areas of property casualty business: direct, assumed, and pools and syndicates. Direct exposure arises from Tier III and IV peripheral asbestos defendants. There are no active Tier I or II accounts, largely due to a business strategy not to write direct coverage for larger companies but to focus on smaller, regional businesses. Tiers I and II are generally defined as those engaged in asbestos mining, manufacturing and building products industries. These are thought of as the traditional asbestos defendants and were the targets of the first wave of asbestos litigation. There are not many Tier I or II defendants in the industry who are not currently, or who have not previously, declared bankruptcy. Tiers III and IV are commonly known as the peripheral asbestos defendants and they are generally defined as those who manufactured, distributed or installed an asbestos containing product, or who owned or operated a facility where asbestos products were present. Reserves for these asbestos liabilities accounted for $217 million, or 81%, of our total net loss reserves for asbestos exposures at December 31, 2009. Former Ohio Casualty and GRE Operations The former Ohio Casualty operations exposure to direct asbestos claims arises from directly written general liability, commercial multiple peril, and umbrella coverage issued to local and regional companies from the 1950s through the 1990s. Most former GRE operations exposures arise from our acquisition of GREs U.S. operations in 1999. Our direct asbestos liabilities arise from direct and excess business written through the 1960s by subsidiaries acquired through the GRE acquisition. These direct exposures arise from Tier III and IV peripheral asbestos defendants. Former Ohio Casualty operations assumed asbestos liabilities were acquired through acquisitions by Ohio Casualty and consist of contracts with small limits written prior to 1980. Reserves for these asbestos liabilities accounted for $50 million, or 19% of our total net loss reserves for asbestos exposures at December 31, 2009. Environmental Claims Exposure Our environmental claims result from our assumed reinsurance run-off operations and from our commercial general liability line that we write on a direct basis. We have attempted to avoid writing coverages for large companies with substantial environmental claims exposures. As a result, our average environmental claim tends to be small. Our relatively limited environmental claims activity results in fluctuations in average values from period to period. Of the total $140 million of held net reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2009, $75 million, or 54%, was attributable to the former Safeco operations, while $65 million, or 46%, was attributable to the former Ohio Casualty and GRE operations. 134 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the activity for our A&E unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, a component of our reserve for claims and claim adjustment expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Asbestos: Balance as of January 1 $ 347 $ 75 $ 21 Less: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 54 17 7 Net balance as of January 1 293 58 14 Balance attributable to acquisitions  234 45 Total incurred (3 ) 6  Total paid 23 5 1 Net balance as of December 31 267 293 58 Add: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 47 54 17 Balance as of December 31 314 347 75 Allowance for reinsurance on unpaid losses 8   Total unpaid losses including allowance for unpaid losses $ 322 $ 347 $ 75 Environmental: Balance as of January 1 $ 169 $ 93 $ 24 Less: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 19 4 10 Net balance as of January 1 150 89 14 Balance attributable to acquisitions  83 33 Total incurred 6 (5 ) 49 Total paid 16 17 7 Net balance as of December 31 140 150 89 Add: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 20 19 4 Balance as of December 31 $ 160 $ 169 $ 93 Estimating Loss Reserves for Asbestos Claims The uncertainties associated with establishing reserves for asbestos claims and claim adjustment expenses are compounded by the differing, and at times inconsistent, court rulings on asbestos coverage issues involving: (i) the differing interpretations of various insurance policy provisions and whether certain asbestos losses are or were ever intended to be covered; (ii) when a loss occurred and what policies potentially provide coverage; (iii) whether there is an insured obligation to defend; (iv) whether a compensable loss or injury has occurred; (v) how policy limits are determined; (vi) how policy exclusions are applied and interpreted; (vii) the impact of entities seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities; (viii) whether clean-up costs are covered as insured property damage and (ix) applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products or completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. We estimate our net asbestos reserves based upon numerous factors, including the facts surrounding reported cases and exposures to claims, such as policy limits and deductibles, current law, past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims, reinsurance coverage as well as analysis of industry studies and events, such as recent settlements and asbestos-related bankruptcies. As a result of the significant uncertainty inherent in determining our asbestos liabilities, the amount of reserves required to adequately fund our asbestos claims cannot be accurately estimated using conventional 135 Table of Contents reserving methodologies based upon historical data and trends and the use of conventional reserving methodologies frequently has to be supplemented by subjective considerations, including management judgment. Thus, the ultimate amount of our asbestos exposure may vary materially from the reserves currently recorded and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Estimating Loss Reserves for Environmental Claims We also receive claims from policyholders arising out of the alleged disposal of hazardous substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later amended, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute obligates responsible parties to develop and implement remediation plans or reimburse the costs of remediation. The law also allows for the recovery of natural resources damages from liable parties. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several with other responsible parties. The environmental claims we receive are primarily due to various legislative and regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. Most environmental claims that impact polices incepting on or before December 31, 1999 are handled by CERC on our behalf. We have been and continue to be involved in coverage litigation pertaining to environmental claims. We believe that several court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions generally pertain to insurance policies that were issued by our companies prior to the mid-1970s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We establish reserves for environmental claims and claim adjustment expenses on a claim-by-claim basis where coverage is not in dispute. In addition to claim-by-claim reserves, we carry an aggregate bulk reserve for all environmental claims that involve a coverage dispute until the dispute is resolved. This bulk reserve covers adverse development on covered claims, reserves for claims in which coverage is disputed, and future unreported claims. The bulk reserve is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and our experience in resolving those claims. In cases involving coverage disputes, we seek the broadest terms possible when entering into settlements. This can be on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis or on a claim-by-claim basis. In some cases, the settlement between us and the policyholder extinguishes any obligation we may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy-back of policies or coverage buyout for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation that we may have for other claims, including asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. Provisions of these agreements may also, where possible, include appropriate indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect us. Our general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce and fix our potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs. In establishing environmental reserves, we evaluate the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any, for each policyholder. In the course of this analysis, we consider the probable liability, available coverage, and the relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures. We also consider the many variables presented, such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of governmental enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between us and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance we have issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. We do not rely exclusively on conventional actuarial techniques to estimate these reserves. 136 Table of Contents The duration of our investigation and review of any claims and the amount of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to us, vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes, and the willingness of the policyholder to negotiate, if appropriate, a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. Based upon our experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from several months to several years. Consistent with Liberty Mutual Groups experience in this area, we have experienced a reduction in the number of policyholders with pending environmental coverage litigation disputes, a continued reduction in the number of policyholders tendering an environmental remediation-type claim to us for the first time, and a continued reduction in the overall number of policyholders with active environmental claims. Our review of policyholders tendering claims for the first time has indicated that they are lower in severity, and that policyholders are smaller in size, have fewer sites, and are lower profile defendants. In addition, site analysis and clean-up technologies are improving, which is resulting in greater efficiency and lower costs. Safeco Commercial Insurance Run-Off Block Safeco Commercial Insurance run-off reserves primarily consist of:  Liability related to workers compensation and workers compensation large deductible exposure, general liability and umbrella liability;  Liability arising from alleged clergy abuse claims;  Liability related to all pre-1998 Safeco and former American States commercial lines policies including select exited product lines, such as errors and omissions and director and officers liability insurance; and  Liability related to Safecos construction defect program on all activity from 1997 and prior years and exposure on commercial multiple peril and monoline general liability lines only from 1999 and prior years, which primarily consists of direct business. Ohio Casualty-Great American Insurance Run-Off Block In 1998, Ohio Casualty acquired Great American Insurance Companys commercial lines division. The product lines included in the transaction were workers compensation, commercial multiple peril, umbrella, and commercial automobile, excluding business in California. As part of the acquisition, Ohio Casualty assumed losses on the book of business for the period prior to December 1, 1998. It also assumed liability for business written subsequent to November 30, 1998 by Great American Insurance Company while business was transitioned to Ohio Casualty affiliates. Currently, the run-off reserves in this category relate predominantly to workers compensation coverage. Safeco Assumed Reinsurance In addition to the assumed reinsurance A&E exposure of American Union Reinsurance Company that Safeco acquired when it acquired American States Insurance Company, Safeco also assumed American Union Reinsurance Companys non-A&E reinsurance liability from the years of 1993 and prior years. Also included in this category are the run-off reserves from a discontinued high school and college catastrophic sports injury insurance program and run-off of assumed voluntary pool business. The run-off reserves in this category primarily relate to general and other liability coverages. Other Run-Off We have designated a number of other operations as run-off operations, and we include them in this category. The run-off reserves in this category relate primarily to the following programs or product lines:  Liability related to Ohio Casualtys exited California commercial lines business, predominantly related to workers compensation; 137 Table of Contents  Liability related to our former Go-America non-standard private passenger automobile business that we discontinued in 2007, predominantly related to liability coverage; and  Liability related to our exposure on various other discontinued programs. Unexpected changes in risk factors relating to our Reinsurance Operations and Run-Off Operations can impact reserves. For example, at December 31, 2009, a 1% increase/(decrease) in incremental paid loss development experienced in each future calendar period and relating to our Corporate and Other segment could result in a $21 million, or 1.3%, increase/(decrease) in loss reserves. Reinsurance Recoverables Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. We evaluate and monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we become involved in coverage disputes with our reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine our rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. We report our reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. From time to time, as a result of the long tail nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, we consider the commutation of reinsurance contracts. Changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional statement of operations charges. Total reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2009 declined by $101 million from the same date in 2008, primarily due to collections on reinsurance recoverables and reserve releases on prior year ceded contracts, offset by net incurred activity on the Homeowners Quota Share Treaty. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance at December 31, 2009 remained unchanged from the same date in 2008. Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers compensation service business and have the obligation of the participating insurance companies on a joint and several basis supporting these cessions. The following table summarizes the composition of our reinsurance recoverable assets: At December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollar in millions) Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 1,296 $ 1,368 Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance (75 ) (75 ) Net reinsurance recoverables 1,221 1,293 Mandatory pools and associations 259 288 Total reinsurance recoverables $ 1,480 $ 1,581 Investment Valuations Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and disclosures about fair value measurements. It provides guidance on how to measure fair value when required under existing accounting standards and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels (Level 1, 2 and 3). Level 1 inputs are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets in active markets that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are 138 Table of Contents observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, for the asset. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs reflecting our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset (including assumptions about risk). Fixed maturities and short-term investments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated financial statements. In instances where there are quoted prices in active markets for identical fixed maturities and short term investments, as is the case within the U.S. Treasury market, these securities are categorized as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. For securities where the fair value of fixed maturity and short-term securities are estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations, bond spreads, or models that have inputs from published interest rate yield curves, these securities are generally categorized as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, in some instances where fixed maturity and short-term securities use significant inputs that are unobservable, they are categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Equity securities are recorded at fair value in our consolidated financial statements. The fair value of certain common stocks is based on quoted prices in active markets. Those common stocks are categorized as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The remaining common stocks are not publicly traded and their fair value is based on observable significant inputs and are categorized as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of preferred stocks is generally determined by quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; hence they are categorized as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, in some instances where equity securities use significant inputs that are unobservable, they are categorized as Level 3 of the hierarchy. Mortgage loans and limited partnership investments representing the majority of other investments, on the balance sheet, are not subject to these disclosures and therefore are excluded from the above table. Other Investments : Fair values approximate our equity in the limited partnerships net assets. Mortgage Loans : The fair values are estimated using an option-adjusted discounted cash flow valuation. The valuation includes both observable market inputs and estimated model parameters. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term Investments : The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for these instruments approximate fair values. Debt Outstanding : Fair values of short-term borrowings and capital lease obligations approximate carrying value. Fair values of long-term debt were based on either quoted market prices or estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on our incremental borrowing rate at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Impairment Losses on Investments Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized in income using the specific identification method. Unrealized losses that are other-than-temporary are recognized as realized losses. We review fixed maturity securities, public equity securities and private equity securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. Securities are reviewed for both quantitative and qualitative considerations including, but not limited to: (a) the extent of the decline in fair value below book value, (b) the duration of the decline, (c) significant adverse changes in the financial condition or near term prospects for the investment or issuer, (d) significant changes in the business climate or credit ratings of the issuer, (e) general market conditions and volatility, (f) industry factors, and (g) the past impairment history of the security holding or the issuer. For fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, we separate impairments into credit loss and non-credit loss components. The determination of the credit loss component of the impairment charge is based on managements best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security compared to its amortized cost, and is reported as part of net realized investment losses. The non-credit component, the residual difference between the credit impairment component and the fair value, is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The factors considered in making an evaluation of credit versus non-credit other-than-temporary impairment include: (a) failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments (including the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood the issuer will be able to make payments that increase in the future), (b) performance indicators of 139 Table of Contents the underlying assets in the security (including default and delinquency rates), (c) vintage, (d) geographic concentration, and (e) industry analyst reports, sector credit ratings, and volatility of the securitys fair value. For non-fixed maturity investments and fixed maturity investments we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment (the amount by which amortized cost exceeds fair value) is included in net realized investment losses. Upon recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment loss, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized in net realized investment losses. The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment. All mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities are reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment treatment in accordance with the guidance of ASC 320, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities and ASC 325, Investments  Other . Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we have not recognized any additional material other-than-temporary impairments. Variable Interest Entities We invest in private equity and real estate limited partnerships and other entities subject to variable interest entity (VIE) analysis under the VIE subsections of ASC 810. We analyze each investment to determine whether it is a VIE, and if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary or a significant interest holder based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment. We evaluate the design of the entity, the risks to which the entity was designed to expose the variable interest holder, and the extent of our variable interest in the VIE. VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary but hold a variable interest are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with ASC 323, Investments  Equity Method and Joint Ventures Our variable interests in VIEs are principally private equity limited partnerships in which we have invested as a passive limited partner. The partnerships were deemed to be VIEs because the equity holders as a group lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the respective entitys economic performance. The VIEs generate variability primarily from investment portfolio performance and that variability is passed to equity holders. For these VIEs, we absorb a portion, but not a majority, of this variability. We did not have unconsolidated VIEs in which we had a significant variable interest as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Further, we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIEs. Limited partnership assets are included in other investments on our consolidated balance sheets. The unfunded commitment of VIEs also is included in the total unfunded commitment disclosure in Note 11  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to our historical consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. There is no recourse provision to the general credit of us for any VIE beyond the full amount of our loss exposure. We are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the financial results of Montgomery Mutual Insurance Company, National Insurance Association, America First Lloyds Insurance Company, American States Lloyds Insurance Company and Safeco Lloyds Insurance Company. As a result, these entities are included in the our historical consolidated financial statements. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually (performed in the third quarter) using a two-step process. The goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which are our three operating and reporting segments: Commercial, Personal and Surety. Within our reporting segments there are regional operations. For each respective segment the regional operations are aggregated together to form reporting units 140 Table of Contents as the products, policyholders, senior management, pricing models and expected returns are similar across all regions within each segment. Therefore our reporting units for goodwill and intangible testing are the same as our reporting segments. The first step is performed to identify potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value, excluding goodwill. If necessary, the second step is performed for the purpose of measuring the amount of impairment, if any. Impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount is not recoverable from the discounted cash flows using a market rate and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with no residual value. The carrying value of intangibles assets with a finite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually (performed in the third quarter) for indicators of impairment in value. If an indicator of impairment exists, a discounted cash flow model is used and impairment is recognized only if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated fair value of the asset. The following table presents the carrying amount of our goodwill by segment at December 31, 2009 and 2008: At December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Commercial $ 1,497 $ 1,497 Personal 988 988 Surety 569 569 Total Goodwill $ 3,054 $ 3,054 Our goodwill asset at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3,054 million, largely consisting of purchase price in excess of net assets relating to the Ohio Casualty and Safeco acquisitions. These acquisitions resulted in significant cost synergies and other benefits throughout Liberty Mutual Group. Liberty Mutual Group performed an impairment analysis in the third quarter of 2009 using an income-based approach. Based on that analysis, the fair market value of Liberty Mutual Groups Agency Markets business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment was necessary. However, because the legal entities that gave rise to this goodwill are part of our company, when we prepared our carve-out financial statements we were required under GAAP to record the full amount of the historical goodwill on our balance sheet and to test that goodwill for our financial statements at each of our reporting units (i.e., segments), only taking into account the synergies and benefits realized by each of our segments, without regard to synergies and benefits realized elsewhere in the Liberty Mutual Group. We conducted an impairment analysis on each of our segments on this required basis in the fourth quarter of 2008, and determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for our Personal segment exceeded its fair value, and recognized an impairment charge in our Personal segment of $973 million in 2008. However, the carrying value of goodwill recorded in the consolidated financial statements of Liberty Mutual Group was unaffected. Other Intangible Assets The following table presents the carrying amount of our intangible assets by segment at December 31, 2009 and 2008: At December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Commercial $ 353 $ 369 Personal 619 649 Surety 85 89 Total intangible assets $ 1,057 $ 1,107 141 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of other intangible assets by major asset class as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: As of December 31, 2009 Gross Carrying Accumulated Value Amortization Net (Dollars in millions) Intangibles Subject to Amortization Agency relationships $ 766 $ (70 ) $ 696 Non-compete agreements 4 (4 )  Leases 12 5 17 Other 1 (1 )  Total intangibles assets subject to amortization 783 (70 ) 713 Total intangibles assets not subject to amortization 344  344 Total other intangible assets $ 1,127 $ (70 ) $ 1,057 As of December 31, 2008 Intangibles Subject to Amortization Agency relationships $ 766 $ (21 ) $ 745 Non-compete agreements 4 (3 ) 1 Leases 12 2 14 Other 1 (1 )  Total intangibles assets subject to amortization 783 (23 ) 760 Total intangibles assets not subject to amortization 347  347 Total other intangible assets $ 1,130 $ (23 ) $ 1,107 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates (inclusive of credit spreads), foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or prices changes. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures were managed as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The majority of funds available for investments are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable U.S. Government bonds, tax-exempt U.S. municipal bonds, and taxable corporate bonds and loan backed securities. We closely monitor the duration of our fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy our insurance and debt obligations. Below investment grade securities represented 4.6% and 2.6% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The average duration of our interest sensitive assets (i.e. fixed maturities, preferred stock and commercial mortgage loans) was 4.2 years at December 31, 2009 and 4.9 years at December 31, 2008. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $8.742 billion and $8.256 billion, respectively, of securities that are obligations of state, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we held commercial mortgage-backed securities of $552 million and $485 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009, approximately 16% of the underlying collateral securities 142 Table of Contents had been defeased with U.S. Treasuries and less than 18% of the holdings were backed by 2006 to 2008 vintage transactions. The commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolio is supported by the loans that are diversified across economic sectors and geographical areas. We do not believe this portfolio exposes us to a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolios relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities. We invest in residential collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) that typically have high credit quality, offer good liquidity and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to U.S. Treasury securities. Our investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that offer the most favorable investment return given the risks involved. One significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity. While prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration) and its effects on total return cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 included residential mortgage-backed securities collateralized by prime mortgages with a market value of $197 million and $282 million, respectively (approximately 0.9% and 1.4% of invested assets at year-end 2009 and 2008). Our fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008 included residential mortgage-backed securities collateralized by Alt-A mortgages with a market value of $64 million and $61 million, respectively (approximately 0.3% of invested assets in both periods). Our fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008 included residential mortgage-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a market value of $38 million and $63 million, respectively (approximately 0.2% and 0.3% of invested assets at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively). Interest Rate Trends and the Investment Environment A rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new fixed maturity investments, thereby favorably impacting net investment income, while reducing the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and therefore stockholders equity. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments, thereby negatively impacting net investment income, but increases the market value of existing new investments and therefore stockholders equity. We had a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $731 million at December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, yields on municipal fixed maturity securities declined, which increased the market value of our portfolio of such securities. In addition, credit spreads narrowed on other non-municipal fixed maturity securities which also resulted in an increase in the market value of those securities. At December 31, 2009, approximately 2% of our invested assets were comprised of equity securities, limited partnerships and LLCs, which are subject to greater volatility than fixed maturity investments. General economic conditions, capital market conditions and many other factors beyond our control may affect the value of these non-fixed maturity investments and the realization of net investment income. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets could adversely impact our investment portfolio, particularly investments in private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships, resulting in a decline in transaction volume in these asset classes and as a result, lower net investment income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, these non-fixed maturity investments collectively produced negative investment income. If the current unfavorable economic environment persists in 2010, we may continue to experience negative returns from these investments. We are not able to predict future market conditions or any related impact on net investment income. Net investment income is an important contributor to our results of operations, and we expect the investment environment to remain challenging through the remainder 2010 and into 2011, particularly with respect to our non-fixed maturity investment portfolio. Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates 143 Table of Contents and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time. In our sensitivity analysis model, a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. Near-term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value. Interest Rate Risk In this sensitivity analysis model, we use fair values to measure potential loss. The sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, preferred stock and commercial mortgage loans and debt. The primary market risk to our market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk (inclusive of credit spreads). The sensitivity analysis model uses a 100 basis point change (1%) in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model. For invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates. Durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate features. Durations on tax-exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the U.S. Treasury Curve. Fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, including accrued interest, using holdings as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. For debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating a hypothetical price based on the yield to maturity adjusted to reflect a +/- 100 basis point change. The hypothetical price is then compared to the actual price and the difference multiplied to the par or securities outstanding to arrive at change in fair value. As of December 31, 2009, the sensitivity analysis model used by us produces a loss in fair value of debt of approximately $1.2 million based on a 100 basis point increase in rates and a gain of approximately $1.2 million based on a 100 basis point decrease in rates. For market sensitive invested assets, the sensitivity analysis model used by us produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $900 million based on a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008. The loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that we might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends. In addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of interest rate increases on the fair value of our financial instruments. As a result, the loss value excludes a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet, primarily claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, which if included in the sensitivity analysis model, would mitigate the impact of the loss in fair value associated with a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. 144 Table of Contents BUSINESS Overview We are the second largest writer of property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, and the tenth largest writer of all property and casualty insurance in the United States, in each case based on 2008 net written premiums. We offer a balanced mix of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-size businesses and individuals throughout the United States. We also provide contract and commercial surety bonds on a national basis. We combine a national infrastructure with a regional focus, which enables us to develop and maintain strong relationships with independent agencies and policyholders. In 2009, we produced $10.1 billion of net written premiums through approximately 13,000 independent agencies. These premiums include $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion generated by our Commercial and Personal segments, respectively. We are currently part of Liberty Mutual Group, the fifth largest property and casualty insurer in the United States, based on 2008 direct written premiums. Liberty Mutual Group had $31.1 billion of revenues in 2009 and $109.5 billion of total assets at December 31, 2009. We have grown significantly both organically and through acquisitions, including the acquisition of Safeco in September 2008 and Ohio Casualty in August 2007. Safeco was a publicly-traded insurance holding company that sold personal, commercial and surety products primarily through independent agents in the United States, and wrote $5.6 billion of net written premiums in 2007. Ohio Casualty was a publicly-traded insurance holding company that sold personal, commercial and specialty insurance products primarily through independent agents in the United States, and wrote $1.4 billion of net written premiums in 2006. Segments We provide property and casualty insurance products through our three operating segments: Commercial, Personal and Surety. Each operating segment is led by an experienced management team with a high degree of autonomy to make decisions on key operating matters within established parameters. We believe this decentralized operating philosophy combined with our regional focus allows us to more effectively reach and serve our agents and policyholders. Our national infrastructure creates economies of scale and provides our regional operations with centralized functions, including pricing and underwriting tools, product development and claims management. We believe our regional focus results in better agency and policyholder relationships and, when combined with our national infrastructure, produces superior product design, service, underwriting and claims processing. The managers of our operating segments are eligible to receive incentive-based compensation based on the operating performance of their segment and the overall performance of our company, thereby encouraging cooperation across the entire organization. In addition to our three operating segments, we also have a fourth segment, Corporate and Other, which reflects the results of external reinsurance, inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, run-off operations, net realized investment gains (losses), unallocated investment income, and interest and other expenses. We market our products using a co-branding strategy under which each of our operating segment brands is identified as a member of the Liberty Mutual Group. As part of this co-branding strategy, under a trademark license agreement with Liberty Mutual, we have the right to use certain marks containing the words Liberty Mutual and the Statue of Liberty design. We believe this co-branding approach leverages the national awareness of the Liberty Mutual brand, while differentiating our products within our target markets. Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation, the issuer of the Class A common stock offered hereby, is currently an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc., a non-public mutual insurance holding company. The initial public offering of our Class A common stock represents an opportunity for Liberty Mutual to enhance its overall financial flexibility by enabling one of its significant business units to access the equity capital markets. Following this offering, Liberty Mutual will indirectly own all of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing % of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and % of our total equity ownership. Liberty Mutual will not own any of our outstanding Class A common stock. We intend to sell no more than a 20% equity interest in our company in this offering. 145 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual has advised us that it expects to maintain a controlling interest in our company going forward. See Description of Capital Stock, Ownership of Common Stock and Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Relationship with Liberty Mutual. There is minimal overlap between our business and the other business units of Liberty Mutual. Our Commercial segment predominantly targets small and mid-size commercial customers, while Liberty Mutuals commercial lines business unit targets larger commercial customers. Our Personal segment distributes only through independent agencies, while Liberty Mutuals personal lines business unit utilizes entirely different distribution channels. Liberty Mutual does not participate in the surety segment of the United States property and casualty insurance market. Finally, we do not conduct business outside the United States, while Liberty Mutual distributes its products globally. Industry Property insurance generally covers the financial consequences of accidental losses to an individual insureds property, such as a home and the personal property in it, or a building, inventory and equipment of a business. Casualty insurance (often referred to as liability insurance) generally covers the financial consequences of a legal liability of an individual or an organization resulting from negligent acts and omissions causing bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party. Claims on property coverage generally are reported and settled in a relatively short period of time, whereas those on casualty coverage can take years, even decades, to settle. Distribution Property and casualty insurance companies generally market their products through one of three distribution systems: independent agents and brokers, exclusive agents or direct writing. Independent agents and brokers usually produce business for or have relationships with multiple unrelated property and casualty insurers. Exclusive agents represent one insurer, but are not employees of that insurer. Direct writing companies generally operate through sales representatives employed by the insurer. Independent insurance agencies accounted for approximately 50% of property and casualty net written premiums in the United States in 2008, according to A.M. Best. By line of business, independent agents generated 69% of commercial lines net written premiums and 30% of personal lines net written premiums in the United States in 2008, according to A.M. Best. We believe that independent agencies and brokers will continue to be a significant intermediary in the property and casualty insurance industry. Although insurers that write directly or through captive agents are generally regarded as having expense advantages in their cost structure, these insurers have not been able to capitalize on these advantages to displace the independent agent distribution system. We further believe that as technologies emerge, the single platform advantages of direct writers and captive agents will erode, enabling the independent agents advantages as advisors/advocates with access to a broader variety of products to emerge as the preferred choice for consumers. Finally, we believe that our exclusive focus on independent agency distribution, combined with our scale, strengthens our position within this channel and enables us to access a broad base of profitable customer relationships over the long-term. We believe there were approximately 37,500 independent insurance agencies in the United States in 2008. We distribute substantially all of our insurance products and services through approximately 13,000 of these independent agencies. These independent agencies are located in approximately 25,000 offices across all 50 states. We believe that our focus on independent agencies eliminates potential channel conflict and enables us to capture a broad base of profitable policyholder relationships over the long-term. To protect the integrity of our franchise we are selective in appointing our agencies. In selecting new independent agencies to distribute our products, we consider each agencys profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit with our operating and marketing plans. No single agency produced more than approximately 1.5% of our net written premiums in 2009. We seek to develop strong partnerships with independent agencies by being a critical part of their success and profitability. We achieve this by, among other things, providing competitive products to meet the needs of agencies and policyholders, displaying a strong orientation, delivering technology solutions that enable ease of 146 Table of Contents doing business, utilizing profit sharing arrangements that reward agents for profitable underwriting growth and providing consistency in the marketplace. In turn, agencies endeavor to grow profitably with us by distributing our products to those customers who best meet our underwriting criteria. We have established agency advisory councils to solicit input from our agencies on, among other topics, product design and policyholder issues. At December 31, 2009, we believe we ranked as one of the top three carriers in terms of premiums in approximately 50% of our commercial lines agencies and in approximately 30% of our personal lines agencies. We believe this degree of penetration in an agency enables our company to have the best opportunities to write the highest quality business. Based on an industry study of independent insurance agents, the top three insurers represented by an independent agency accounted for approximately 90% of the total premiums produced by that agency in 2008. Competitive Strengths We believe the following are our key competitive strengths:  Strong Agency Relationships Resulting in High Quality Business: As many of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates have been in business for over 80 years, we have a deep understanding of our agents and policyholders needs. Our local reach through our 128 offices in the United States provides our agents with direct access to our regional executives and enables us to work closely with those agents by providing planning, support and training services. Our franchise has been built over many years through these relationships, particularly with our top performing agents. Given our deep and long-standing agency relationships, we believe we have the opportunity to write the highest quality business and the value of our franchise cannot be easily or quickly replicated.  Localized Knowledge from Multiple Regional Operations with a Highly Efficient National Infrastructure: We are able to combine the high quality service and responsiveness of a regional carrier with the sophisticated underwriting, product development, claims management capability and capital base of a national carrier. This unique combination enables us to develop and maintain deep, long-lasting relationships with independent agencies and policyholders.  Well-Diversified and Balanced Business Mix: Our business is highly diversified and balanced by product, geographic region, agency relationship and customer account. Our Commercial and Personal segments contributed approximately 45% and 46%, respectively, of our 2009 net written premiums. We believe this diversification enables us to effectively manage through property and casualty pricing cycles and reduces the capital and earnings impact of any single catastrophic event.  Sophisticated Pricing, Underwriting and Risk Management: Our pricing, underwriting and risk management strategy emphasizes profitable growth and optimization of our risk-adjusted returns in each of our operating segments and product lines. We use proprietary models in conjunction with rigorous analytical review to make pricing and underwriting decisions and to manage risk exposures across geographies, product lines and customer segments. Our objective is to achieve (i) underwriting profitability, (ii) disciplined, opportunistic growth and (iii) attractive risk-adjusted returns.  Superior Financial Strength: Our capitalization and financial strength create a competitive advantage in retaining and attracting new business. After giving pro forma effect to this offering and the transactions for which we have made pro forma adjustments as described under Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2009 we would have had total assets, debt and stockholders equity of $ billion, $ million and $ billion, respectively. Furthermore, we believe our reserve position is strong and is bolstered by the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement between us and Liberty Mutual, which provides us with $500 million of coverage for adverse development in our legacy run-off liability exposures. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. We believe our strong balance sheet and the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement will afford us continued future financial flexibility enabling us to write more desirable business.  Disciplined Acquisition Strategy and Proven Integration Experience: We have proven experience in acquiring and successfully integrating property and casualty businesses, including Safeco and Ohio 147 Table of Contents Casualty. We are a disciplined acquirer and have a demonstrated ability to realize significant transaction synergies and accelerate earnings growth.  Experienced Management Team with a Successful Track Record: We have a talented and experienced management team led by our Chief Executive Officer and President, Gary Gregg, who has 21 years of service in the property and casualty insurance industry. Our senior management team has worked in the property and casualty insurance industry for an average of 27 years and has an extensive track record of profitably underwriting, growing and acquiring commercial and personal lines businesses. Strategies We intend to manage our business by pursuing the following strategies:  Pursue Profitable Growth While Maintaining Pricing and Underwriting Discipline: We expect to grow each of our businesses and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining our underwriting discipline, well-diversified business mix and broad geographic presence. We believe that the key to success across our businesses lies in our disciplined pricing and underwriting and a culture that focuses on management accountability for the profitability of their respective businesses. We historically have been, and will continue to be, a highly disciplined growth organization.  Attract High Quality Independent Agencies and Strengthen Existing Relationships: A critical competitive advantage in the property and casualty insurance industry is a loyal, high quality and well managed distribution network that matches the insurers products and services with the needs of its policyholders. We believe that our strong agency relationships are the key to success across all of our businesses. It is our objective to be one of the top three insurers within the agencies that distribute our products. We intend to continue strengthening our relationships and building our franchise with top performing agents by providing them with planning, support, training and competitive compensation that supports profitable growth. We also intend to grow our business with our agents by increasing cross-selling efforts, providing comprehensive risk management and insurance solutions for the policyholders served by those agents and delivering a broad array of innovative products and services.  Focus on Small and Mid-Size Commercial Segment and Personal Lines Customers with Multi-Faceted Insurance Needs: We seek to leverage our strong independent agency network by targeting small and mid-size commercial accounts and individuals with multi-faceted insurance needs. We believe that many customers prefer to purchase insurance products from trusted independent agents with a presence in their communities. Our unique combination of local expertise and decision-making authority, coupled with the strength of our national platform and strong brands, positions us well to offer agencies the products and services that address policyholders needs at competitive prices. We believe this focus provides us with relatively consistent and predictable risk-adjusted returns and enables us to selectively pursue business with favorable underwriting characteristics.  Leverage Scale, Technical Expertise and State-of-the-Art Underwriting Platforms to Provide Competitive Insurance Products and High Quality Services: We are the third largest writer of personal lines and the fifth largest writer of commercial lines property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, and the second largest writer of surety business in the United States, in each case based on 2008 net written premiums. We intend to continue to build on our scale and technical expertise to provide competitive insurance products and high quality services. As a result of our two most recent acquisitions, we are in the process of unifying our existing underwriting platforms in both our Commercial and Personal segments. The implementation of our unified underwriting platforms will allow us to retire our other underwriting platforms and, once fully implemented, we believe it will result in a decrease in our expense ratio. Our organization has the resources and financial flexibility to continue to devote significant efforts toward technology-based innovations and scale-based efficiencies, both of which are key factors for furthering our competitive advantage in the marketplace.  Capitalize on Fragmentation in the Property and Casualty Insurance Market: We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the fragmentation in the property and casualty insurance market by 148 Table of Contents capturing market share. In commercial lines, we believe approximately $78 billion, or 57%, of the industrys total 2008 net written premiums were written by the approximately 550 insurers, excluding the top ten insurers, while the top ten insurers wrote the remaining $58 billion, or 43%. In personal lines, we believe approximately $22 billion, or 34%, of the industrys total 2008 net written premiums were written by the approximately 370 insurers, excluding the top ten insurers, while the top ten insurers wrote the remaining approximately $43 billion, or 66%. We believe our national infrastructure will provide us with a competitive advantage over regional carriers in capturing market share, while our regional focus will provide us with a competitive advantage over larger national carriers.  Optimize Capital and Leverage Financial Strength: We focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with the flexibility to pursue opportunistic growth. We are committed to disciplined underwriting, earnings growth and capital generation to maintain our financial strength and claims-paying ability ratings. We believe this further enhances our competitive advantage in attracting and retaining profitable business.  Pursue Accretive Strategic Acquisition s: We have successfully acquired and integrated businesses to accelerate the growth of our company. We intend to continue our strategy of pursuing economically attractive business combinations and acquisitions. Our market presence and strong balance sheet and cash flow, together with managements demonstrated acquisition integration experience, create an effective platform for our continued growth through strategic acquisitions. We will selectively pursue accretive strategic acquisitions with a focus on maximizing value for our stockholders. Products and Services We have a well-diversified mix of businesses, as shown in the breakdown of net written premiums by business segment and product line for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008(1) 2007(2) $ % $ % $ % (Dollars in millions) Commercial Commercial multiple peril $ 1,825 18% $ 1,531 23% $ 1,193 27% Commercial automobile 1,118 11% 923 14% 662 15% Workers compensation 880 9% 886 13% 748 17% General liability 479 5% 380 6% 228 5% Other 288 2% 255 3% 208 5% Subtotal (Commercial) $ 4,590 45% $ 3,975 59% $ 3,039 69% Personal Private passenger automobile $ 3,134 31% $ 1,500 22% $ 572 13% Homeowners 1,164 11% 472 7% 321 7% Other 391 4% 150 3% 55 1% Subtotal (Personal) $ 4,689 46% $ 2,122 32% $ 948 21% Surety Contract bond $ 434 4% $ 298 4% $ 213 5% Commercial bond 118 1% 66 1% 43 1% Small bond 155 2% 115 2% 56 1% Subtotal (Surety) $ 707 7% $ 479 7% $ 312 7% Corporate and Other $ 162 2% $ 128 2% $ 108 3% Consolidated Net Written Premiums $ 10,148 100% $ 6,704 100% $ 4,407 100% (1) Includes the results of Safeco subsequent to September 22, 2008. (2) Includes the results of Ohio Casualty subsequent to August 24, 2007. 149 Table of Contents Commercial We are the fifth largest writer of commercial lines property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, based on 2008 net written premiums of $5.0 billion. Our Commercial segment provides commercial lines insurance products coverages, including commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation, general liability and other commercial coverages to small and mid-size businesses. We provide a broad array of insurance products, including customized coverages and services, for a diverse group of businesses and organizations. We believe our Commercial segment business model provides us with a competitive advantage as it allows us to combine the service capabilities, responsiveness, local authority, accountability and brand recognition of regional carriers with the cost efficiencies and financial resources of a national organization. Marketing We utilize a regional co-branding strategy (with eight distinct regional brands identified as members of the Liberty Mutual Group) for our Commercial segment, with each brand defined by geographic region. Each of our eight regional brands has a history of sound commercial underwriting in its respective market that local agents know and trust. We believe that the regional knowledge, local authority, service and access offered by regional insurers are a strong differentiator for commercial lines agents and that they generally prefer the regional insurers over their national peers. As a result, our operating and branding approach focuses on building strong, local relationships with our agency force. Our Commercial segment also markets through our national commercial lines specialty underwriter, Liberty Agency Underwriters, which we refer to in this prospectus as LAU. LAU provides excess casualty products on a national basis and supports our agents by offering coverages not typically offered by a regional carrier. 150 Table of Contents Our underwriters and claims adjusters live and work in many of the same communities as our commercial lines agents and policyholders. Our regional personnel and agents understand the uniqueness of their territories in terms of market, product offering, pricing and underwriting. This allows us to tailor products and services to meet these particular needs. Our eight regional brands and the markets they cover are depicted in the following map: Our Commercial segment writes commercial insurance policies primarily for small and mid-size businesses such as contractors, service and social service providers, financial institutions, manufacturers, and wholesalers and retailers. Approximately 95% of our commercial lines policies have annual premiums of less than $15,000, as depicted in the following table showing total direct written premiums in 2009 and policies in force at December 31, 2009, stratified by annual policy premiums: Number of Policies in Total Direct Written Annual Policy Premiums Force Premiums (In thousands) (Dollars in millions) <$5K 899 $ 1,408 $5-$15K 151 1,316 $15K-$50K 47 1,229 $50K-$100K 6 424 $100K 2 440 Total 1,105 $ 4,817 151 Table of Contents Description of Product Lines Our Commercial segment offers the following coverages:  Commercial Multiple Peril: Provides coverage tailored to small and mid-size businesses in the form of a package policy that includes property and liability insurance coverages. The property portion covers damage arising from various perils, including fire, wind, hail, water and theft, as well as financial loss due to business interruption. The liability portion covers small and mid-size businesses for liability resulting from bodily injury and property damage to third parties arising from their business operations, accidents on their premises and the products they manufacture or sell.  Commercial Automobile: Consists of physical damage and liability coverage. Automobile physical damage insurance covers loss or damage to vehicles from collision, vandalism, fire, theft or other causes. Automobile liability insurance covers bodily injury of others, damage to their property and costs of legal defense resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in a business.  Workers Compensation: Provides coverage for employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees. There are typically four types of benefits payable under workers compensation policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death benefits and vocational rehabilitation benefits.  General Liability: Covers businesses for liability resulting from bodily injury and property damage arising from their general business operations, accidents on their premises and the products they manufacture or sell.  Other: Consists primarily of inland marine, farmowners multiple peril, allied lines and fire. Underwriting and Pricing Although our Commercial segment markets and distributes insurance products through regional brands, it benefits from the underwriting capabilities and ease of use of a national carrier. Pricing levels for our property and casualty insurance products are developed by state and by product line based on the frequency and severity of estimated claims, the expenses of producing business and managing claims, and an allowance for profit. Consistent with our operating principle of maintaining pricing and underwriting discipline, competitive yet adequate pricing is a critical component for achieving an underwriting profit. We underwrite our insurance products with a disciplined approach toward pricing. Each independent agent appointed by our Commercial segment is assigned to a specific team of employees responsible for working with the agent on business plan development, marketing, and overall growth and profitability. We use agency level management information to analyze and understand results and to identify problems and opportunities. We use several proprietary multi-variate pricing models to effectively and efficiently price the most homogeneous risks by product. For more complex products, we use tiered rating plans, analytical pricing tools, and underwriting and loss prevention expertise to provide more tailored pricing for our policyholders based on underwriting criteria applicable to the risk. Our Commercial segment field underwriting organization has offices across the United States, each aligned with one of our eight regional commercial lines brands. Tiered rating plans used in conjunction with our proprietary multi-variate pricing models in our Commercial segment permit us to offer more tailored price quotes to our agents based on underwriting criteria applicable to each tier. As a result, we have the flexibility to issue policies covering a variety of unique or niche risks, as well as to renew expiring policies into the appropriate tier, taking into account changing risk and market conditions. The enhanced accuracy and precision of our rate plans enables us to price our products to the exposure and permit our agents to deliver tailored solutions to a broader range of policyholders. In order to limit our exposure to catastrophe losses, we have stringent guidelines for writing new commercial business in markets where there is an increased risk of catastrophe. Also, we have tightened underwriting standards and implemented price increases in some catastrophe-prone areas. We use computer 152 Table of Contents modeling techniques to assess our level of exposure to loss in hurricane and earthquake catastrophe-prone areas. We monitor our underwriting and pricing practices as well as terms and conditions. Base rates are updated to achieve targeted returns and minimize exposure in lines and classes of business where pricing is inadequate. To the extent changes in premium rates, policy forms or other underwriting and pricing matters are subject to regulatory approval, we proactively monitor our pending regulatory filings to facilitate their prompt processing and approval. We expend considerable effort to measure and verify exposures and insured values. Lastly, in addition to using these processes in pricing our products, we also rely on inputs from our local management teams that have in-depth understanding of the competitive landscape and clients in the regions they manage. As a result of our acquisitions, our Commercial segment operates with four underwriting platforms. Over the next several years, we will be implementing an enhanced, unified underwriting platform created for us by Liberty Mutual, which we refer to in this prospectus as ECLPS. We believe ECLPS will enhance our efficiency by providing greater flexibility in ratemaking and a reduction in the time it takes to introduce new products to the market. Over time, our migration to ECLPS will allow us to retire our other commercial lines underwriting platforms. Once ECLPS is fully implemented, we believe it will result in a decrease in our expense ratio. The following 10 states accounted for 55% of our Commercial segments direct written premiums in 2009: Direct Written % of Premiums Total (Dollars in millions) By State: California $ 636 13 % Texas 303 7 New York 263 6 Washington 242 5 New Jersey 236 5 Oregon 230 5 Illinois 208 4 Pennsylvania 201 4 Indiana 163 3 Connecticut 160 3 Top 10 States 2,642 55 Other States 2,175 45 Total Commercial $ 4,817 100 % Personal Through our Personal segment, we are the third largest writer of personal lines property and casualty insurance distributed through independent agencies in the United States, based on 2008 net written premiums. We offer insurance coverage for private passenger automobile, homeowners and other risks to individuals and families, with an emphasis on service and pricing sophistication. Combining the historical strengths of Safeco and Ohio Casualty with those of our existing operations, our Personal segment is now characterized by product innovation, brand recognition, strong agency relationships and national capabilities and efficiencies. Marketing Prior to acquiring Safeco in 2008, we utilized regional brands for this segment. Following the acquisition, our Personal segment began to market and distribute nationally using the Safeco Insurance brand, co-branded 153 Table of Contents as a member of the Liberty Mutual Group. Safeco Insurance is a nationally-recognized and respected insurance brand. We believe that strong national brand awareness from a policyholder perspective is a key differentiator in the Personal segment and an important factor in a potential policyholders purchasing decision. We focus on traditional and preferred automobile and homeowners customers. Although Safeco Insurance is a national brand that reflects the scale and expertise of a national organization, we have implemented eight Personal regions, covering geographic territories that are identical to those of our Commercial regional brands. This strategy allows us to leverage local knowledge and decision-making, operating flexibility, and coordination of agency relationships between our Commercial and Personal segments. The Personal regions, with their local execution, are designed to foster coordination with our Commercial regional brands where appropriate, build relationships with our agencies, and place us close to the marketplace to capitalize on growth and profit opportunities. Description of Product Lines Our Personal segment offers the following coverages:  Private Passenger Automobile: Consists of physical damage and liability coverage. Automobile physical damage insurance covers loss or damage to vehicles from collision, vandalism, fire, theft or various other perils. Automobile liability insurance covers bodily injury of others, damage to their property and costs of legal defense resulting from a collision caused by the insured. In addition, many states require policies to provide what is frequently referred to as no-fault coverage whereby policyholders recover medical and related expenses from their own insurance company, regardless of fault, and their right to commence litigation to recover for pain and suffering is restricted.  Homeowners: Covers losses to an insureds home, including its contents, as a result of weather, fire, theft and various other perils, and losses resulting from liability for acts of negligence by the insured or the insureds immediate family. We provide homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and rental property contents. We also offer identity theft resolution assistance and identity theft expense reimbursement coverage as an option that can be added to a homeowners policy.  Other: Includes products covering fire, allied lines, general liability and inland marine. Underwriting and Pricing Pricing levels for our property and casualty insurance products are developed by state and by line based on the frequency and severity of estimated claims, the expenses of producing business and managing claims, and an allowance for profit. We use several proprietary multi-variate pricing models to effectively and efficiently price the most homogeneous risks by product. Where permitted under state law, we use credit scoring, education and occupation data as factors in pricing decisions. Consistent with our operating principle of maintaining pricing and underwriting discipline, competitive yet adequate pricing is a critical component for achieving an underwriting profit. Pricing for personal automobile insurance is driven by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care and litigation of liability claims. As a result, the profitability of the business is largely dependent on promptly identifying and rectifying disparities between premium levels and expected claim costs and obtaining approval of the state regulatory authorities for indicated rate changes. Pricing in the homeowners business is also driven by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in building supplies, labor costs and household possessions. Most homeowners policies offer, but do not require, automatic increases in coverage to reflect growth in replacement costs and property values. In addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril coverage, the profitability and pricing of homeowners insurance is affected by the incidence of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes, winter storms, wind and hail, earthquakes and tornadoes. In order to limit our exposure to catastrophe losses, we have stringent guidelines for writing new homeowners business in markets where there is an increased risk of catastrophe. Also, we have tightened 154 Table of Contents underwriting standards and implemented price increases in some catastrophe-prone areas, and instituted deductibles in hurricane and wind and hail prone areas. We use computer modeling techniques to assess our level of exposure to loss in hurricane and earthquake catastrophe-prone areas. We use traditional reinsurance and in California we are covered by the CEA. For further information on the CEA, see  Reinsurance Protection and Catastrophe Management. Independent agents utilize our automated quote and issue system, which will issue the policy if it conforms to established guidelines. Exceptions are reviewed by our underwriters. Each of our eight personal lines regions is aligned with one of our three underwriting offices. Operating out of these offices, each of our underwriters is assigned to particular agents and is knowledgeable about his or her respective territory. Each independent agent appointed by our Personal segment is also assigned to a specific team of employees responsible for working with the agent on business plan development, marketing, and overall growth and profitability. We use agency level management information to analyze and understand results and to identify problems and opportunities. Since our acquisition of Safeco, we have begun writing new personal lines business almost exclusively on Safecos personal lines underwriting platform. Over time, we plan to renew all expiring personal lines business on the Safeco underwriting platform as well. We believe that this will ultimately allow us to retire our other personal lines platforms and result in a decrease in our expense ratio. The following 10 states accounted for 55% of our Personal segments direct written premiums in 2009: Direct Written % of Premiums Total (Dollars in millions) By State: California $ 649 13 % Washington 479 10 Texas 328 7 Oregon 221 4 Connecticut 188 4 Ohio 180 4 Missouri 179 4 Kentucky 159 3 Pennsylvania 151 3 Illinois 151 3 Top 10 States 2,685 55 Other States 2,186 45 Total Personal $ 4,871 100 % Surety Through our Surety segment, we are the second largest writer of surety business in the United States, based on 2008 net written premiums. Our Surety segment works closely with independent agencies and their customers to build mutually profitable relationships by providing smart business solutions coupled with professional, consistent and responsive service. Through our Surety segment, we offer contract surety bonds primarily to middle market businesses and large contractors. Our commercial surety products meet the bonding needs of large, national accounts. We have longstanding agency and customer relationships and experienced underwriting and claims personnel which provide us with a competitive advantage in this marketplace. There are three parties to a surety contract: the insurer, the principal (our customer or bondholder) and the beneficiary, each of whom has obligations under the contract. We are the party that guarantees fulfillment of the principals obligation to its beneficiary. We are responsible for evaluating the risk and determining if the 155 Table of Contents principal meets the underlying requirements for the bond. If our principal defaults on a contract bond, we may step in and complete the project, arrange for a new contractor to complete the project or finance the principal to complete the project. We use our technical surety claims staff, outside attorneys and engineers to evaluate contract completion strategy, recovery estimates and salvage potential. In either case, we are generally entitled to recover losses from the principal and expenses paid to third parties. Our Surety segment business is written both by insurance subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation and by certain of Liberty Mutuals insurance subsidiaries. In 2009, $280 million, or 40%, of our Surety segments net written premiums were written by insurance subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual on behalf of our Surety segment. The business written by our Surety segment on Liberty Mutuals subsidiaries is reinsured by us pursuant to a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement between Liberty Mutual and us. We have underwriting authority on surety business written by Liberty Mutuals subsidiaries and reinsured by us. In connection with this offering, we and Liberty Mutual have agreed to amend this 100% quota share reinsurance agreement so that it has an initial term of five years and will continue thereafter unless terminated on 365 days notice; provided that it may be terminated on 365 days prior to the expiration of the five year term if Liberty Mutual ceases to own shares entitled to more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Services Agreements  Surety Services Agreements. Marketing Using the Liberty Mutual Surety brand, we market and distribute a full range of surety bond products nationally through an extensive network of agencies specializing in contract and commercial surety bonds. We market under this brand primarily to national accounts, middle market businesses and large contractors. Using the Liberty SuretyFirst brand, we also market contract and commercial surety bonds to regional accounts consisting of small and mid-size business and individuals. The small bond product line we market using the Liberty SuretyFirst brand allows us to broaden our product offering through agencies appointed by our Commercial or Personal segments. At December 31, 2009, we had over 385,000 surety bonds in-force. Description of Product Lines We provide a full range of bond products for customers with small, middle and large market capacity needs. We specialize in providing contract surety bonds for construction firms, manufacturers, and suppliers as well as commercial surety bonds for corporations and individuals. We offer surety products and services through three product lines: Contract Bond. As a provider of contract surety bonds for construction contractors, manufacturers and suppliers, we offer performance and payment bonds that support a variety of construction projects. Our business extends to many types of public and private construction, including schools, office buildings, hotels, hospitals, prisons, highways, bridges, airports, sewer and water lines, and water treatment plants. Customers include local, regional, national and international contractors across a variety of construction sectors, including general builders, construction managers, design-build contractors, heavy equipment contractors, subcontractors and specialty contractors. Commercial Bond. We offer flexible, consistent and comprehensive commercial surety programs. These programs help keep businesses running by providing bonding capacity in direct relation to a customers credit quality and the nature of the required surety obligations. The types of commercial surety bonds provided include supply, court, customs, license and permit, notary, probate, public official, regulatory and tax bonds. Small Bond. Marketed under the Liberty SuretyFirst brand, our small bond product line allows us to leverage agencies appointed by our Commercial and Personal segments who may not be surety specialists. We use a technology platform geared toward transactional business to provide contract and commercial bonds to small and mid-size business and individuals. 156 Table of Contents Underwriting and Pricing Our Surety segment is focused on consistent underwriting profitability. The extent and sophistication of underwriting activity varies by type of risk. Contractor accounts and large commercial surety principals undergo credit, financial and managerial review and analysis on a regular basis. Within commercial surety, there are approximately 250 risk profile class codes with which commercial surety bonds can be classified. Certain classifications of bonds, such as fiduciary and court appeal bonds, require more extensive underwriting. We also target various products in the surety bond market that are characterized by relatively low-risk exposure and small bond amounts. Surety underwriting is largely a credit-based business that relies upon skilled underwriting personnel with deep industry and customer knowledge. On a contract bond, our underwriting personnel will assess the work that is expected to be performed and the likely ability of the contractor to successfully perform the work. Because we may be called upon to meet the principals obligations, our surety underwriters will consider, among other things, the principals financial strength, management structure and hierarchy, references, reputation, track record and ability to meet its other obligations. Additionally, we may require that the principal provide collateral, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash, to secure its obligation to us. Our Surety segment field underwriting organization has 40 offices across the country, each aligned with one of five regional operating groups. Our surety underwriters are experienced, with an average of over 10 years in the industry. Due to the differences in contract and commercial bond underwriting, our underwriters specialize in either contract or commercial surety underwriting. We have long-standing relationships with our surety principals, some of which have been our accounts for over 50 years. Each independent agent appointed by our Surety segment is assigned to a specific team of employees responsible for working with the agent on business plan development, marketing and overall growth and profitability. We use agency level management information to analyze and understand results and to identify problems and opportunities. The following 10 states accounted for 58% of our Surety segments direct written premiums in 2009: Direct Written % of Premiums Total (Dollars in millions) By State: California $ 86 12 % New York 73 10 Texas 64 9 Florida 43 6 Pennsylvania 36 5 Washington 26 4 Virginia 26 3 Illinois 25 3 New Jersey 25 3 Massachusetts 20 3 Top 10 States 424 58 Other States 305 42 Total Surety $ 729 100 % Claims Management Effective claims management is a critical factor in achieving satisfactory underwriting results, given that claims payments and claims expenses represent a substantial portion of our costs. Delivering successful, cost-effective claims management, while achieving policyholder satisfaction, is a core tenet of our claims management strategy and philosophy. 157 Table of Contents Each of our operating segments has a claims organization that meets the different claims needs of that segments policyholders. We have field claims management teams located in 37 offices in 19 states. In our Commercial segment, core claims management is aligned with our geographic regions. In our Personal segment, core claims management is handled in regional office hubs supported by smaller service offices. Our regional structure allows our local claims handlers and claims management to have jurisdictional expertise and build deep relationships with our local agents and customers. We share certain services nationally in Centers of Excellence to capitalize on expertise and take advantage of economies of scale. These shared services include a national automobile center, catastrophe claims unit, claims contact centers, subrogation, field investigators and vendor management. The disposition of claims and other claim-related activity is performed in accordance with established policies, procedures and expense controls. In our Surety segment, we maintain an experienced and dedicated staff of in-house claims specialists focusing on surety. While core claims management functions are largely centralized, our dedicated surety claims specialists are accountable by region. Indemnity and subrogation rights exist on a significant portion of the business written, enabling us to pursue loss recovery from the principal. In addition to our indemnification and subrogation rights, our standard customer indemnification agreements also permit us, at our sole discretion, to secure collateral from our customers, which we may apply when we believe a risk has deteriorated. We manage the vast majority of our claims with in-house staff claims managers. Approved external service providers and vendors, such as adjusters, appraisers, investigators and attorneys, are used to augment this model, primarily where the geographic location is remote or the needed skill set is unique. When these vendors are approved for use, we closely monitor these resources and manage the contractual relationships to sustain appropriate service levels while managing claims processing costs. For a description of run-off claims administration, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses  Corporate and Other  Run-Off Operations. Strategic Acquisitions One of our core competencies is our ability to complete economically attractive acquisitions and successfully and efficiently integrate them into our businesses. This competency is built upon a disciplined acquisition strategy that focuses on strategic and accretive transactions, where we execute on our transaction plans, realize synergies post purchase and enhance the profitable growth of our company. In pursuit of this strategy, we have consummated seven strategic acquisitions since the beginning of 1995, including the acquisitions of Safeco and Ohio Casualty. On September 22, 2008, we acquired Safeco for total consideration of approximately $6.2 billion. Safeco was a publicly traded insurance holding company that sold personal, commercial and surety insurance products primarily through independent agents in the United States, with approximately $5.6 billion of 2007 net written premiums. Following the acquisition, we became the third largest personal lines and the fifth largest commercial lines property and casualty insurer distributing through independent agents in the United States, and the second largest surety insurer in the United States, in each case, based on 2008 consolidated net written premiums as compiled and published by A.M. Best. In 2009, our Personal segment began marketing and distributing nationally using the Safeco Insurance brand, co-branded as a member of the Liberty Mutual Group. On August 24, 2007, we acquired Ohio Casualty for a total consideration of approximately $2.8 billion. Ohio Casualty was a publicly traded insurance holding company that sold personal, commercial and specialty insurance products through independent agents in the United States, with approximately $1.4 billion of 2006 net written premiums. Intercompany Pooling Arrangements Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are direct or indirect participants in an intercompany pooling arrangement, which we refer to in this prospectus as the LMAC Pool. Pooling arrangements allow a 158 Table of Contents participant to rely on the aggregate capacity of all participants capital and surplus instead of just its own capital and surplus and to obtain a uniform rating from rating agencies. Under a pooling arrangement, the participating insurance companies share substantially all insurance business that is written by the participants and allocate the combined premiums, losses, expenses, assets (other than investments) and liabilities among the participants based on each participants designated share of the pools business. The LMAC Pool was initially effective January 1, 1996, and was substantially amended and restated on January 1, 2007. All of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are either parties to the LMAC Pool or cede their business to the LMAC Pool pursuant to the terms of a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with our subsidiary Peerless Insurance Company, which we refer to as PIC, the lead company in the LMAC Pool. All our business, whether produced through us or by Liberty Mutual on our behalf, is ceded to the LMAC Pool. Terrorism On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was enacted into Federal law, thereby establishing the Program, a temporary Federal program in the U.S. Treasury Department that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. In December 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 was enacted into Federal law, extending coverage to include domestic acts of terrorism and reauthorizing the Program through December 31, 2014. In order for a loss to be covered under the Program, the loss must meet certain aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an event that is certified as an act of terrorism by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The annual aggregate industry loss minimum is $100 million through 2014. Certain lines of business that we write, including commercial automobile, professional liability (other than directors and officers), surety, burglary and theft, and farmowners multi-peril, are exempted from coverage under the Terrorism Acts. In the case of a war declared by Congress, only workers compensation losses are covered by the Terrorism Acts. The Terrorism Acts generally require that all commercial property casualty insurers licensed in the United States participate in the Program. Under the Program, a participating insurer is entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal government for 85% of subject losses in excess of an insurers deductible, subject to an annual cap. The Federal reimbursement percentage is 85% through 2014. The deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of an insurers and its affiliates direct premiums earned for covered lines for the preceding calendar year. We estimate the amount that we (together with the insurance subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual Group) will collectively have to pay in the context of a covered loss before the Federal backstop becomes available to be $1.757 billion for 2010. Under the Terrorism Acts, we must include the direct premiums earned of all of our insurance company affiliates, whether or not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by us, in calculating our deductible. This includes the insurance company subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual. Under the Intercompany Agreement, we and Liberty Mutual will agree that any recovery from the Federal government under the Program will be allocated to each affiliated insurer in the proportion its insured losses (net of collectible reinsurance) bear to its and its affiliates aggregate insured losses (net of collectible reinsurance) under the Program. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement  Allocation of Coverage under the Terrorism Acts. The annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100 billion. Once subject losses have reached the $100 billion aggregate during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the Program for additional covered terrorism losses for that program year. We have had no terrorism-related losses since the Program was established. Because the Terrorism Acts are relatively new and their interpretation is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how they will be applied to specific circumstances. It is also possible that future legislative action could change the Terrorism Acts. Further, given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in our own reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly unconventional acts of terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could be material to our results of operations, 159 Table of Contents financial position and/or liquidity in future periods. We will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring and controlling terrorism risk aggregations to the best of our ability. As part of our ERM, we closely monitor and manage the concentration of terrorism risk by geographic area. We monitor our terrorism exposure through reports generated each quarter. Exposure of potential new business that individually presents significant exposure or is located in areas of existing concentration is evaluated as part of the underwriting process. Through this process, we believe we have taken appropriate steps to limit our exposure to terrorist acts. See Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business  Terrorist acts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and our ability to reinsure or manage such risk is limited. Reinsurance Protection and Catastrophe Management In the ordinary course of our business, we purchase reinsurance from high quality, highly rated reinsurers, including Liberty Mutual. We purchase reinsurance to control our exposure to losses and protect our capital resources. We believe that reinsurance purchased from Liberty Mutual is provided at market rates and substantially on the same terms and conditions offered by third party reinsurers. The timing and size of catastrophe losses are unpredictable and the level of losses experienced in any year could be material to our operating results and financial position. We purchase reinsurance to mitigate exposure to catastrophic events. Catastrophe losses include not only natural events such as earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes and other types of storms, but also man-made events such as terrorist acts. The extent of losses caused by a given catastrophe is a function of both the amount and type of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. We monitor not only the probable maximum loss associated with the exposures and events but also the conditional tail expectation. We recognize that some events potentially expose us to both a property and liability loss. For a further discussion of our reinsurance program and catastrophe management, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Reinsurance Protection and Catastrophe Management. Reinsurance Recoverables We believe our reinsurance recoverables are from high quality reinsurers. Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates remain liable in the event a reinsurer is unable to meet its obligation for paid and unpaid reinsurance recoverables and unearned premiums ceded under a reinsurance agreement. The collectibility of reinsurance is also subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, coverage interpretations and other factors. At December 31, 2009, we held approximately $222 million of collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities or letters of credit. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Reinsurance Protection and Catastrophe Management  Reinsurance Recoverables and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Reinsurance Recoverables. Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves Our reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses represent managements best estimate of the ultimate cost of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and those claims incurred but not reported. In arriving at managements best estimate, management utilizes actuarial indications in conjunction with their knowledge and judgment about operational and environmental conditions. Consideration is given to any limitations in the actuarial methodologies and assumptions that may not completely reflect future loss emergence as well as to historical volatility of reserve estimates, and the historical movement of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense estimates as these years typically mature. Thus, managements best estimate gives consideration to the actuarial indications, including facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretation of legal theories of liability, current known trends and specifics about our underlying insured exposures (size, geography, legal climate), as well as the possible uncertainty not adequately reflected in the historical data. In establishing loss reserves, we also take into account estimated reinsurance recoveries and salvage and subrogation. 160 Table of Contents For a further discussion of our reserves, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves. Liability Lines Most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis, which means that claims occurring during the policy period are covered regardless of whether or not they are reported to us during the policy period. These policies are subject to substantial claims development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of our reserve development in A&E exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation, and judicial interpretations, among others. Product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event that triggers claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled more quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. A major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. A long reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. Reserves Held We, like other insurance companies, categorize and track our loss reserves by product line. We also regularly review the appropriateness of our loss reserves at each of our four segments. At December 31, 2009, Commercial, Personal, Corporate and Other and Surety accounted for approximately 61%, 21%, 15% and 3% of our loss reserves, respectively. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves for additional details regarding our loss reserves, our actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating loss reserves, and our quarterly review process. Because establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established loss reserves will change. We reflect adjustments to loss reserves in our results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. There are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of our company and insureds to access portions of the affected areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge. For additional information relating to how we estimate our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, including our A&E reserves, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Estimates  Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves. 161 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our claims and claim adjustment expenses reserve activities for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Balance as of January 1 $ 12,651 $ 7,307 $ 4,327 Less: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 1,517 1,158 620 Net balance as of January 1 11,134 6,149 3,707 Balance attributable to acquisitions  4,928 2,128 Incurred attributable to: Current year 6,859 4,818 2,913 Prior years (702 ) (492 ) (312 ) Total incurred 6,157 4,326 2,601 Paid attributable to: Current year 3,443 2,414 1,223 Prior years 3,161 1,855 1,064 Total paid 6,604 4,269 2,287 Add: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 1,366 1,517 1,158 Balance as of December 31 $ 12,053 $ 12,651 $ 7,307 Included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are certain reserves discounted to the present value of estimated future payments. The held discounted reserves on these unpaid workers compensation claims, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $335 million and $315 million, respectively, and the held undiscounted reserves on these unpaid workers compensation claims were $510 million and $492 million, respectively. The liabilities for losses for most long-term disability payments under workers compensation were discounted at risk free rates in effect when the losses were incurred. Those rates were 3.7%, 4.0% and 4.8% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The weighted average discount rate for all years was 5.9% at December 31, 2009. We applied this change in method by retrospective application to the prior years financial statements. The following information presents (1) our reserve development over the preceding ten years and (2) a reconciliation of reserves in accordance with accounting principles and practices prescribed or permitted by insurance authorities (statutory basis) to such reserves determined in accordance with GAAP, each as prescribed by Securities Act Industry Guide No. 6. Section I of the ten year table shows the estimated liability that was recorded at the end of each of the indicated years for all current and prior accident year unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The liability represents the estimated amount of claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR reserves. In accordance with GAAP, the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is recorded in the balance sheet gross of the effects of reinsurance with an estimate of reinsurance recoverables arising from reinsurance contracts reported separately as an asset. The net balance represents the estimated amount of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses outstanding as of the balance sheet date, reduced by estimates of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts. Section II shows the cumulative amount of net claims and claim adjustment expenses paid relating to recorded liabilities as of the end of each succeeding year. Section III shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded net liability as of the end of each succeeding year. Estimates of the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses are increased or decreased as payments are made and more information regarding individual claims and trends, such as overall frequency and severity patterns, becomes known. Section IV shows the cumulative net deficiency/(redundancy) representing the aggregate change in the liability from original balance sheet dates and the re-estimated liability through December 31, 2009. Section V shows the gross re-estimated liability and re-estimated reinsurance recoverables through December 31, 2009. Section VI 162 Table of Contents shows the gross cumulative deficiency/(redundancy) representing the aggregate change in the liability from original balance sheet dates and the re-estimated liability through December 31, 2009.

(c) Cumulative amounts paid and reserves reestimated for years ended December 31, 2006 and prior are based on statutory annual statement data found in Schedule P and includes history for all of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates as of December 31, 2006 whether or not individual subsidiaries or affiliates were originally part of our company. Development taking place on these reserves during calendar years 2007 and 2008 was determined on a pooled basis using the pooling percentages in place at that time. 163 Table of Contents In addition to the reinsurance recoverables noted above, other differences could exist between statutory and GAAP reserves. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the differences were $(22) million and $40 million, respectively. The difference in 2009 was largely driven by $(20) million associated with discounting of our workers compensation reserves. The difference in 2008 was primarily driven by a $62 million fair value adjustment related to our A&E reserves associated with the acquired Safeco business, partially offset by $20 million relating to workers compensation discounting. Investments Our investment policy and strategy are reviewed and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries, which meet on a regular basis to review and consider investment activities, tactics and new investment classes. Pursuant to the terms of our investment management agreements with Liberty Mutual, and with the oversight of the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries and our Chief Financial Officer, Liberty Mutual manages our insurance subsidiaries investment portfolios with an experienced team of investment personnel. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Investment Portfolio and Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Investment Management Agreements. Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio mix at December 31, 2009 consisted in large part of high quality, fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, as well as a smaller allocation to common and preferred equity securities and other investments, such as commercial mortgage loans, private equity and private real estate investments. A portion of these other investments are held in limited partnerships and limited liability companies. Our management believes that prudent levels of investments in common equity securities and other investments within our investment portfolio are likely to enhance long term after-tax total returns without significantly increasing the risk profile of the portfolio. We regularly review our entire portfolio in the context of macroeconomic and capital market conditions. For a discussion of the anticipated post-offering breakdown of our investment portfolio, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Investment Portfolio. Ratings Insurance companies are evaluated by various rating agencies in order to measure each companys financial strength. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims. We believe that strong ratings are an important factor in the marketing of insurance products to agents and consumers. Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, all of which participate in the LMAC Pool, have a current interactive financial strength rating and outlook as a group as set forth in the chart below. Rating Agency Rating Rank of Rating Outlook A.M. Best A (Excellent) (3 rd highest of 15 ratings) Negative S&P A- (Strong) (7 th highest of 21 ratings) Stable Moodys A2 (Good) (6 th highest of 21 ratings) Negative Following our 2008 acquisition of Safeco, S&P downgraded the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries to A− from A and Moodys revised its outlook to negative. Subsequently, in April 2009, A.M. Best revised its outlook to negative. These financial strength ratings do not refer to our ability to meet non-insurance obligations, and are not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy issued by us or to buy, hold or sell our securities. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any rating agency. 164 Table of Contents Information Technology Overall Structure Liberty Mutual Group is supported by a team of approximately 4,000 information technology (IT) service and support personnel. This team is located in six primary locations: Seattle, WA, Indianapolis, IN, Fairfield, OH, Portland, OR, and Portsmouth and Dover, NH. There are approximately 1,000 personnel within the Liberty Mutual Group IT team specifically assigned to providing Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation and its subsidiaries with application development and maintenance support services. This team provides essential services to the following application areas:  Agency and policyholder channel management, including portals and e-bonding  Billing services  Claims processing and management  Policy administration systems, underwriting, pricing and rules engines  Content and document management  Financial systems  Information management, business intelligence and data warehousing In addition to the above personnel, we are also supported by Liberty Mutuals central architecture/infrastructure and operations. These IT functions provide the following:  Data center operations and facilities management  Disaster recovery and backup services/storage  Centralized and distributed computing, data storage management and desktop support, asset management, and change management  Data networking, multi-protocol label switching and related carrier services, and remote access  Voice and video communications, voice over internet protocol, wireless services and contact center support  Help desk operations  Print and publishing processing services We additionally receive certain IT support services through agreements between Liberty Mutual and key hardware, software and services suppliers and providers. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement. We pay charges or direct fees to cover all support, services and personnel (employees/contractors/license agreements). Operating Systems, Hardware and Business Application Software We use a variety of well-known vendor-supplied operating systems to run our computer desktops, laptops, mid-range servers and mainframes. We strive to keep our environment current with new technology versions and capabilities. We use several systems management tools, processes and software to manage our various technology systems. These tools, processes and software support a number of functions, including security, scheduling, load balancing, monitoring, provisioning, asset management, change management and other related capabilities. 165 Table of Contents Our broad application technology portfolio is built on a mixture of commercial off-the-shelf products and proprietary software. Where possible, we purchase software products that provide key capabilities, such as in our claims processing activities. Given the acquisitions of Safeco and Ohio Casualty, we are in the process of consolidating our core business applications systems. To this end, we currently have a number of strategic initiatives focused on areas such as policy administration, claims management, billing and information management. For example, by virtue of our acquisitions, our Commercial segment operates on four underwriting platforms. Over the next several years, we will be implementing ECLPS, an enhanced, unified underwriting platform created for us by Liberty Mutual. We believe that migration to ECLPS will ultimately allow us to retire our other commercial lines underwriting platforms. We do not own any of our operating systems or underwriting platforms, including ECLPS. Liberty Mutual licenses these systems to us pursuant to the terms of the Intercompany Agreement. Upon termination of the Intercompany Agreement and any transition services agreement, Liberty Mutual will continue to license us our core claims, underwriting financial reporting and billing systems, including ECLPS. However, Liberty Mutual may terminate these licenses in the event we undergo a change in control. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreements. Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery and Compliance Liberty Mutuals IT group administers a full-time business continuity plan for the restoration of information infrastructure and applications, with emphasis placed on mission critical applications and data. In conjunction with Liberty Mutuals IT group, we are in an ongoing process of managing, testing and improving this plan as it applies to our business. We also take a disciplined approach to legal and regulatory compliance practices in order to instill a strong commitment to integrity and responsibility in our business practices. Competition Property and casualty insurance is highly competitive. At December 31, 2009, there were over 1,500 combined property and casualty companies in the United States. Many of these companies offer property and casualty insurance products similar to those marketed by our company. In addition, a substantial amount of commercial risk, particularly for larger companies, is covered by self-insurance, risk-purchasing groups, risk-retention groups or captive insurance companies. In our Commercial segment, we compete with numerous regional insurance companies, including Acuity, Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Hanover Insurance Group, Harleysville Group, Selective Insurance Group, The Republic Group, Unitrin, Inc. and W.R. Berkley Corporation, as well as national insurance companies, including The Chubb Corporation, CNA Financial Corporation, Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., The Travelers Companies, Inc. and Zurich Financial Services Group. In our Personal segment, we compete with numerous regional insurance companies, including Auto-Owners Insurance Group, Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Erie Insurance Group, Homesite, Hanover Insurance Group, Progressive, as well as national insurance companies, including The Allstate Corporation, Berkshire Hathaway (GEICO), Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., The Travelers Companies, Inc., State Farm, Zurich Financial Services Group (Farmers and Foremost Auto) and White Mountains (Esurance). In our Surety segment, we compete with numerous regional and national insurance companies, including The Chubb Corporation, CNA Financial Corporation, Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., The Travelers Companies, Inc. and Zurich Financial Services Group. The more significant competitive factors for most insurance products we offer are price, product terms and claims service. Our underwriting principles and dedication to independent agency distribution are unlikely to make us the low-cost provider in most markets. However, while it is often difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products to consumers, we believe that our dedication to providing superior product offerings, expertise and local talent, claims service and disciplined underwriting provide a competitive 166 Table of Contents advantage over typical low-cost providers. However, as the emergence and growth of competitors that have lower cost structures, such as direct writers, continues, we will face greater pressure on our pricing which may have an impact on our ability to compete. Employees and Services Provided by Liberty Mutual Although we currently have no employees, Liberty Mutual provides us with approximately 11,000 Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees under various services agreements. Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees include our executive officers. See Management. Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees provide marketing, communications, human resources, agency administration, claims management, product management and state filing, policy administration, underwriting, reinsurance, actuarial, legal and regulatory compliance, accounting and other services necessary to our and our subsidiaries day-to-day business operations. Liberty Mutual provides us with additional corporate services through employees that service us and other affiliates of Liberty Mutual. These additional corporate services include certain supplemental expertise in accounting and financial reporting, advertising, employee relations and benefits, human resources, information technology, investment management, legal and litigation management, payroll processing, purchasing, real estate management, regulatory compliance, reinsurance, risk management, tax, treasury, administration of Run-Off Operations, and other services. We reimburse Liberty Mutual for certain office space and expenses and related services rendered by Liberty Mutual. We intend to keep each of the existing services agreements in place until January 1, 2011 and rely on Liberty Mutual to provide the services and personnel, including executive officers, necessary to operate our business. Under the terms of an agreement that we will enter into with Liberty Mutual prior to the consummation of this offering, Liberty Mutual will use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer all of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees, including executive officers, to us as of January 1, 2011. Following January 1, 2011, Liberty Mutual will continue to provide us with accounting and financial reporting, advertising, employee relations and benefits, human resources, information technology, investment management, legal and litigation management, payroll processing, purchasing, real estate management, regulatory compliance, reinsurance, risk management, tax, treasury, administration of Run-Off Operations, and other services. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions. Insurance Affiliates We are affiliated with several legal entities that participate in the LMAC Pool, even though these entities are not owned by us. These entities include: Montgomery Mutual Insurance Company, a mutual insurance company; National Insurance Association, a reciprocal insurance exchange; and America First Lloyds Insurance Company, American States Lloyds Insurance Company and Safeco Lloyds Insurance Company, each of which is a Texas Lloyds company. As a result of these entities participation in the LMAC Pool, we assume all of the financial results of these legal entities and we consolidate these entities into our financial results. See Note 3  Investments to our historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. Properties Our principal office is located at 175 Berkeley Street, Boston, Massachusetts. We also maintain branch offices in various locations throughout the United States. Our principal office and certain of our branch offices are provided to us by Liberty Mutual under a license agreement. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Real Estate License Agreements. Management considers our office facilities suitable and adequate for our current level of operations. Legal Proceedings We are regularly involved in legal, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. These include proceedings specific to our company, including our Run-Off Operations, as well as proceedings generally applicable to the property and casualty industry. 167 Table of Contents The Society of Jesus, Oregon Province (the Debtor) has sought insurance coverage from certain of our insurance subsidiaries acquired in the Safeco acquisition for certain claims by persons who claim sexual abuse by one or more persons associated with the Debtor. The Debtor, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2009 in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Oregon (the Bankruptcy Court), contends that one or more of the Safeco insurers issued liability policies to the Debtor for the period 19661992. Until its bankruptcy filing, we defended the Debtor against certain tort claims and paid certain indemnity amounts on behalf of the Debtor in connection with the tort claims, subject to a reservation of rights. On October 23, 2009, to advance resolution of certain of the coverage issues, we filed an adversary proceeding, General Insurance Co. of America v. Society of Jesus, Oregon Province, Adversary Proceeding Case No. 09-3351 (Bankr. D. Or.) (the Adversary Proceeding) against the Debtor, seeking a declaration that we do not have a duty to defend and/or indemnify the Debtor with respect to many of the tort claims. We and the Debtor are the only parties to the Adversary Proceeding. The Debtor has answered and counterclaimed for declaratory relief; discovery is proceeding pursuant to an agreed schedule approved by order of December 17, 2009. We and the Debtor are currently participating in a court ordered mediation, along with representatives of certain tort claimants, which process, if successful, would resolve the parties insurance coverage disputes, as well as all pending and future tort claims. Multiple issues exist which bear on whether and to what extent we owe insurance coverage to the Debtor. The most crucial insurance issues include: (1) the existence or lack of insurance coverage provided by us during certain years (sometimes referred to as the missing policy issue); (2) whether the acts complained of by the claimants constitute an occurrence as defined in the insurance policies, and/or whether they are excluded by certain terms and exclusions in the policies, because the alleged acts by the priests were not unexpected or unintended from the perspective of the Debtor; (3) if coverage is available, how many occurrences triggering coverage occurred in a given policy period; and (4) who is and is not covered as an insured under the policies, including the issue of whether non-priest Debtor personnel are covered. Limited discovery is now ongoing by all parties in the mediation. Finally, the creditors committee of the Debtor has announced that it will challenge the validity of the November 2007 Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement entered into by the Debtor and Safeco (the Alaska Settlement Agreement), under which Safeco paid consideration on behalf of the Debtor, in return for a full release of all past, present and future claims against the Debtor alleging clergy abuse that took place in Alaska. Both we and the Debtor maintain that the Alaska Settlement Agreement is a valid and binding agreement. Although the creditors committee recently moved for leave of court to prosecute such action, the matter is temporarily being held in abeyance by agreement of the parties, pending the outcome of the mediation. Various other legal, regulatory and arbitration proceedings against us, in addition to those discussed above, have arisen in the course of our business, including in connection with our claims activities. Proceedings pending against us are subject to uncertainties and we are unable to estimate with certainty the possible loss or range of loss that may result in connection with such proceedings. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties and other relief and reputational losses that could have a material adverse effect on the manner in which we conduct our business or on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We regularly review all pending litigation matters in which we are involved and establish reserves deemed appropriate by management for such matters when a probable loss estimate can be made. 168 Table of Contents REGULATION Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are subject to regulation and supervision in each of the jurisdictions where they are domiciled or licensed to conduct business. The extent of regulation varies, but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state. The regulation, supervision and administration relate to, among other things, standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, premium rates, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct, including the use of credit information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and claims practices. In addition, many states have enacted variations of competitive ratemaking laws, which allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state insurance department, while other states require obtaining such prior approval. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of insurance companies and require the filing of financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual basis. Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are collectively licensed to transact insurance business in all U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends Our top-tier insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, Ohio and Washington. The insurance holding company laws applicable to our top-tier insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, Ohio and Washington require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurers statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurers net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles. In addition, and in conjunction with regulatory approval for our acquisition of Safeco, our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Washington are required to provide notice to, and obtain approval from, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend until September 22, 2010. In Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Washington, dividend payment is further limited in that dividends can only be paid out of adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles. Some of our insurance company subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are commercially domiciled in California and as a result are subject to similar restrictions on the declaration or payment of dividends. The insurance holding company laws applicable to our top-tier insurance subsidiary domiciled in New Hampshire require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds 10% of the insurers surplus as of the preceding December 31. The insurance holding company laws of other states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Holding Company Liquidity and Capital Resources. Rate and Form Approvals Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are subject to each states laws and regulations regarding rate and form approvals. The applicable laws and regulations are used by states to establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or used to engage in unfair price competition. An insurers ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective states requirements. In states having file-and-use laws, an insurer must file a rate with the insurance regulator in such state, but does not need to wait for approval before using such rate. In states having use-and-file laws, an insurer must file rates within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rates. Approximately half of the states require prior approval of most rate changes. 169 Table of Contents Requirements for Exiting Geographic Markets or Canceling or Non-Renewing Policies Several states have laws and regulations which may affect the timing and the ability of an insurer to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in that state. These laws and regulations typically require prior notice, and in some instances insurance department approval, prior to discontinuing a line of business or withdrawing from that state, and they allow insurers to cancel or non-renew certain policies only for certain specified reasons. Assessments for Guaranty Funds and Second-Injury Funds and Other Mandatory Pooling and Reinsurance Arrangements Virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state, including our insurance subsidiaries, to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some claimants because of the insolvency of other insurers. Many states also have laws that established second-injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury. Our insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving workers compensation, automobile insurance, property wind pools in states prone to property damage from hurricanes, and fair access to insurance requirements plans, which provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage in the voluntary market. Assessments may include any charge mandated by statute or regulatory authority that is related directly or indirectly to underwriting activities. Examples of such mechanisms include but are not limited to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. Amounts payable or paid as a result of arrangements that are in substance reinsurance, including certain involuntary pools where insurers are required to assume premiums and losses from those pools, are accounted for as reinsurance (for example, the National Workers Compensation Reinsurance Pool). Amounts related to assessments from arrangements that are not reinsurance are reported as a component of general and administrative expenses in our historical consolidated financial statements. For additional information concerning assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling and reinsurance agreements including state-funding mechanisms, see Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business  Mandated market mechanisms may require us to underwrite policies with a higher risk of loss and assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds and second-injury funds may reduce our profitability. Insurance Regulatory Information System The NAIC developed the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) to help state regulators identify companies that may require special attention. Financial examiners review annual statements and key financial ratios based on year-end data. These ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. Each ratio has an established usual range of results. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios, however, is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have one or more ratios with results outside the usual ranges. Generally, an insurance company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios. For the year ended December 31, 2009, sixteen of our thirty-eight insurance subsidiaries fell outside the usual range of IRIS ratios. However, none of our insurance subsidiaries fell outside of the usual range for more than three IRIS ratios: three fell outside of the usual ranges of three IRIS ratios; two fell outside the usual range of two IRIS ratios; and the other eleven fell outside of the usual range of only one IRIS ratio. There were seven different IRIS ratios as to which our insurance subsidiaries fell outside the usual range, including: gross written premium to policyholders statutory surplus, change in net written premium, two year overall operating investment yield, gross change in policyholders statutory surplus, change in adjusted policyholders statutory surplus and adjusted liabilities to liquid assets. 170 Table of Contents Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2009 IRIS ratio results. In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required. It is possible that similar results may not occur in the future. Risk-Based Capital Requirements The NAIC has RBC requirements for insurance companies. The RBC requirement determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. Under laws adopted by individual states, insurers having total adjusted capital less than that required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies who operate with higher levels of capital. Therefore, we believe it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. At December 31, 2009, all of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the RBC requirements. Model Audit Rule Effective January 1, 2010, the regulators of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates adopted the Annual Financial Reporting Regulation (referred to as the Model Audit Rule). The Model Audit Rule is modeled closely on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and concerns (i) auditor independence, (ii) corporate governance, and (iii) internal control over financial reporting. Our insurance subsidiaries are in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Model Audit Rule, as adopted by the applicable regulators. Investment Regulation Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with these laws and regulations. Agent and Broker Compensation Our insurance subsidiaries sell insurance products and services primarily through appointed independent insurance agents, as well as through insurance brokers. Accordingly, we seek to compensate our agents and brokers consistent with market practices and pay commissions and other consideration for business agents and brokers place with our insurance subsidiaries. We believe our agent compensation practices and disclosures meet current legal and regulatory requirements. In recent years, however, certain state attorneys general have investigated various alleged anticompetitive practices engaged in by several insurance brokers and national insurance companies, including some of our affiliates. Some of these investigations, mainly related to insureds that are much larger than our target policyholders, have resulted in consent orders under which brokers and several of our competitors have left uncontested the allegations of the attorneys general that some of their compensation arrangements may have caused certain brokers to clandestinely steer clients to specific insurers without sufficient disclosure to the client. The consent orders also have, to one degree or another, banned the use of such compensation arrangements by the offending brokers and insurers in several, but not all, lines of business. Given the regulatory scrutiny of compensation arrangements with brokers to date, it is possible that compensation arrangements between insurers and independent agents and brokers will come under further review and will be the subject of public policy debate and possible legislative reform. We monitor these developments but cannot predict the nature or effect, if any, that such a public policy debate or possible legislative reform would have on our agent and broker compensation practices or business. 171 Table of Contents Insurance Holding Company Regulation As a holding company, we are not regulated as an insurance company. However, since we own and control insurance companies, we are subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates states of domicile. All holding company statutes, as well as other laws, require disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate. The holding company statutes and other laws also require, among other things, prior approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer, some transactions between affiliates and the payment of dividends or distributions. Agreements between our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, on the one hand, and us and our affiliates, on the other hand, are also subject to the state insurance holding company statutes. In addition, we, our subsidiaries and our controlled affiliates are part of Liberty Mutuals holding company and will remain a part of Liberty Mutuals holding company for the foreseeable future. As a result, agreements between our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, on the one hand, and Liberty Mutual, on the other hand, are also subject to the state insurance holding company statutes. Insurance Regulations Concerning Change of Control State insurance laws contain provisions that require advance approval by state agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled, or in some cases has substantial business so that the insurer is deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that state. The laws of many states also contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a non-domestic insurance company admitted to transact business in that state. While these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, they do authorize issuance of cease and desist orders with respect to the non-domestic insurer if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition. Any transactions that would constitute a change in control of any of our insurance subsidiaries would generally require prior approval by the insurance departments of the states in which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled. They may also require pre-acquisition notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and in which such insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. These requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of our common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to our stockholders. Terrorism The Program generally requires all commercial property and casualty insurers writing business in the U.S. to make terrorism coverage available to commercial policyholders and provides a Federal backstop for certified terrorist acts that result in losses above individual insurance company deductible amounts. The Terrorism Acts directly apply to our U.S. property and casualty insurance business. The deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of an insurers and it affiliates direct earned premiums for covered lines for the preceding calendar year. We estimate that the amount that we (together with the insurance subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual) will collectively have to pay before the Federal backstop becomes available to be $1.757 billion for 2010. Under the Terrorism Acts, we must include the direct earned premiums of all of our insurance company affiliates, whether or not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by us, in calculating our deductible. This includes the other insurance company subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual Group. We and our insurance company affiliates (including insurance subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual) expect to enter into an allocation agreement pursuant to which any recovery from the Federal government will be allocated to each affiliated insurer in the proportion its insured losses (net of collectible reinsurance) bear to its and its affiliates aggregate insured losses (net of collectible reinsurance) under the Program. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement  Allocation of Coverage under the Terrorism Acts. The annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100 billion. Once subject losses have reached the 172 Table of Contents $100 billion aggregate during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the Program for additional covered terrorism losses for that program year. We have had no terrorism-related losses since the Program was established. As of the effective date of the Reauthorization Act, December 26, 2007, the U.S. government may certify, and the Program will cover, losses caused by any individual, foreign or domestic. Damage outside the U.S. is not covered except in limited circumstances, such as damage to a U.S. air carrier. The Program will remain in effect until December 31, 2014. There can be no assurance that it will be extended beyond that date. In the event that the Program is not extended beyond December 31, 2014 and in the absence of a private reinsurance market for terrorism reinsurance, we may be required to accept financial responsibility for losses that we would not otherwise insure unless state insurance departments allow for the non-renewal of business with significant terrorism risk exposure or the exclusion of coverage for terrorism risks under policy renewals. See Business  Terrorism. Future Legislation In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. Further, in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn, regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations. For example, insurance regulators may choose to restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies or reject rate increases due to the economic environment. Although the United States federal government does not currently directly regulate the insurance business, Congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to allow an optional federal charter, similar to the option available to most banks. In addition to an optional federal insurance charter, the President has proposed and the Congress is considering legislation that could affect the regulation of financial institutions, including insurance companies, and financial activities that represent a systemic risk to financial stability or the U.S. economy. The legislation would establish a federal systemic risk regulator to identify large, interconnected financial institutions that would be subject to heightened prudential standards. The proposed legislative changes could affect the capital, liquidity and leverage ratios of a company so designated. The legislation may also require certain financial institutions, including certain large insurance companies, to make payments to the federal government to help capitalize federal funds that would be established to reduce the potential liability of U.S. taxpayers during times of extreme financial stress or economic instability in the United States. Additionally, the legislation would establish a federal insurance office within the U.S. Treasury Department. The director of the office would be empowered to recommend to the federal systemic risk regulator that an insurance company be subject to heightened prudential standards. The legislation may also pre-empt State law in certain instances involving the regulation of reinsurance and other limited insurance matters. In the future, additional federal regulation may be enacted which could affect the way we conduct our business and could result in higher compliance costs. We believe we are well positioned to succeed in either environment due to our history and experience as state-based regional operations and given our scale and national capabilities that can accommodate federal oversight. We cannot predict the effect any proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business or results of operations. 173 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT Directors and Executive Officers Set forth below are the names, ages and positions of our directors and executive officers as of the date of this prospectus: Name Age Position Edmund F.

Composition of Board; Classes and Directors We intend for our companys board of directors to consist of ten persons, seven of whom will also be current or former employees, directors or officers of Liberty Mutual, and three of whom will be independent. However, immediately following this offering, our board of directors will initially consist of eight directors, 175 Table of Contents including only one independent director. Thereafter, our board of directors may expand the size of the board and approve new board members to the vacancies created thereby in accordance with the provisions of our certificate of incorporation. We will avail ourselves of the controlled company exception provided under the NYSE rules. A controlled company need not comply with the applicable NYSE rules requiring its board of directors to be comprised of a majority of independent directors. A controlled company under the NYSE rules is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by a single stockholder or group of stockholders. Upon completion of this offering, Liberty Mutual will beneficially own all of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing % of the voting power for directors and % of the total economic ownership. Because Liberty Mutual will beneficially own more than 50% of the voting power for the election of our directors immediately following this offering, we will qualify as a controlled company under the NYSE rules. In the event that we are no longer a controlled company, we will be required to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, subject to a phase-in period during the first year we cease to be a controlled company. Liberty Mutual will be able to direct the election of 80% of the members of our board of directors, which we refer to as the Class B Designees, unless prior to any distribution intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355(a) of the Code, or any corresponding provision of any successor statute (a tax free spin-off), Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own shares of Class B common stock representing at least 20% of our outstanding common stock. Messers. Kelly, Alexander, Fontanes, Langwell and Mansfield and Ms. Sayles will be designated as the Class B Designees on our board of directors prior to the completion of this offering. See Description of Capital Stock  Board of Directors. The remaining directors, which we refer to as Joint Designees, will be elected by the holders of the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock, voting together as a single class, with the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock each entitled to one vote per share of common stock. Additional directors appointed to our board of directors following this offering will be designated as either Class B Designees or Joint Designees, as appropriate, such that Class B Designees constitute at least 80% of the board of directors. If the appointment of any director to fill a vacancy on the board of directors would cause the Class B Designees to constitute less than 80% of the board of directors, such vacancy will be filled by a vote of the Class B Designees on the board of directors and such director will be designated as a Class B Designee. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, denominated as class I, class II and class III. Members of each class will hold office for staggered three-year terms. At each annual meeting of our stockholders beginning in 2011, the successors to the directors whose term expires at that meeting will be elected to serve until the third annual meeting after their election or until their successor has been elected and qualified. and will serve as class I directors whose terms expire at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders. , and will serve as class II directors whose terms expire at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders. , and will serve as class III directors whose terms expire at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. Committees of our Board of Directors Our board of directors will establish an audit committee, a compensation committee, a nominating committee, an investment committee and a risk committee to assist it with its responsibilities. While we are not required to have a majority of independent directors under the NYSE rules, the SEC and NYSE rules concerning the independence of members of the audit committees of listed companies (discussed under  Audit Committee below) require us to have at least one director who is independent, as defined under the SEC and NYSE rules, at the time of the completion of this offering, at least two independent directors within 90 days following the completion of this offering and at least three independent directors within one year of this offering. As a result of this requirement, we intend to appoint two additional independent directors as soon as possible, but in any event within the time period prescribed by the NYSE rules. 176 Table of Contents Audit Committee At the completion of this offering our audit committee initially will be composed of , , and , an independent director. We expect our board of directors to determine to be independent under the SEC and NYSE rules. The SEC and NYSE rules require that each issuer has an audit committee of at least three independent members. The SEC and NYSE rules allow an issuer to phase-in, in connection with an initial public offering, the number of directors on the audit committee as well as the independence of such directors. Under the initial public offering phase-in, at the time of listing, the audit committee must have at least one member, and that member must be an independent director (as defined in the SEC and NYSE rules) and must meet the NYSE audit committee financial expert requirement at the time of the listing. Within 90 days after listing, the audit committee must have at least two members, and a majority of the members of the audit committee must be independent. Within one year after listing, the audit committee must have at least three members, all of whom must be independent. In addition, each member of the audit committee is required to be financially literate at the time such member is appointed and at least one member of the audit committee must meet the requirements for an audit committee financial expert under SEC rules. qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as term is defined under the SEC rules. We will modify the composition of our audit committee as required to comply with the NYSE and SEC rules. Our audit committee will have at least four regular meetings each year. The results of each meeting will be reported at the next regular meeting of our board of directors. The principal duties and responsibilities of our audit committee are as follows:  to monitor our financial reporting process and internal control system;  to appoint and replace our independent registered public accounting firm from time to time, determine their compensation and other terms of engagement and oversee their work;  to oversee the performance of our internal audit function; and  to oversee our compliance with legal, ethical and regulatory matters. Our board of directors will adopt a written charter for the audit committee, which we will make available on our website. Nominating Committee Our nominating committee will initially be composed of , and . As long as we are a controlled company, we are not required to maintain a nominating committee comprised of independent directors. Our nominating committee will oversee and advise our board of directors with respect to corporate governance matters, assist our board of directors in identifying and recommending qualified candidates for nomination to our board of directors, make recommendations to our board of directors with respect to assignments to committees of the our board of directors and oversee the evaluation of directors. In the event that we are no longer a controlled company, we will be required to have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, subject to a phase-in period during the first year we cease to be a controlled company. Compensation Committee Our compensation committee will initially be composed of , , and , an independent director. As long as we are a controlled company, we are not required to maintain a compensation committee comprised of independent directors. As soon as possible following the completion of this offering, we intend for our compensation committee to include at least two independent directors and . Our compensation committee will have responsibility for, among other things, all compensation arrangements for executive officers and making awards under our equity compensation plans. In the event that we are no longer a controlled company, we will be required to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, subject to a phase-in period during the first year we cease to be a controlled company. 177 Table of Contents Investment Committee Our investment committee will initially be composed of and . Our investment committee will have responsibility for, among other things: reviewing our investment guidelines/policies, strategies and programs; making recommendations to our board of directors regarding investment asset allocation and financing activities; and reviewing the procedures that we utilize to determine that funds are invested in accordance with policies and procedures approved by our board of directors. Risk Committee Our risk committee will initially be composed of and . Our risk committee will have responsibility for, among other things: oversight of our ERM activities, reviewing our strategies and implementation of our ERM programs. Compensation Discussion and Analysis Our company is an outgrowth of the Agency Markets business unit of Liberty Mutual Group. We do not have any employees at this time. Our executive officers identified under the heading  Directors and Executive Officers in this Management section are currently employees of Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual has historically provided us with employees and executives dedicated to our business and operations under various services agreements, in return for which we have paid service fees to Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual will continue to provide these employees and executives to us through December 31, 2010. On January 1, 2011, Liberty Mutual will transfer these employees and executives to us pursuant to the Intercompany Agreement as described under Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement. The compensation disclosure in this section of the prospectus reflects the compensation actually received by certain of our executive officers from Liberty Mutual for services rendered to us pursuant to the services agreements as if they had been paid directly by us. Gary R. Gregg is our Chief Executive Officer and President and Michael J. Fallon is our Chief Financial Officer. Scott R. Goodby, Michael H. Hughes and Joseph A. Gilles were our next three most highly compensated executive officers in 2009. These executives are referred to below as our named executive officers even though they will continue to be employed by Liberty Mutual and provide services to us under the services agreements through December 31, 2010. All of our named executive officers are dedicated to us at this time, and do not provide services to other business segments within Liberty Mutual. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis reflects the material elements of the current executive compensation program provided by Liberty Mutual Group to its executives, including those of its Agency Markets business unit. As discussed above, we intend to establish a compensation committee and it will be composed of at least two independent members of our board of directors. Our compensation committee will decide how much and what type of compensation and benefits will be provided to our named executive officers. Our anticipated initial compensation and benefits programs described below are not necessarily indicative in all respects of how we will compensate our named executive officers in the future. Among other things, future compensation may take into account increased duties and responsibilities of the named executive officers following the conversion of our company from a business segment of a large private company to a public company. Until our board of directors appoints a compensation committee, we will be working with management at Liberty Mutual to make our initial compensation decisions. Executive Compensation Philosophy as a Business Unit of Liberty Mutual As a business unit of Liberty Mutual Group, the following core principles were applied by Liberty Mutual in structuring the compensation and benefits for our named executive officers consistent with this overriding objective:  A significant percentage of a named executive officers total direct compensation should be performance-based. 178 Table of Contents  Senior executives should have a meaningful continuing stake in Liberty Mutual Groups enterprise value.  A total rewards package should be strongly competitive with other size-appropriate companies in the insurance industry. Our Executive Compensation Philosophy A talented, motivated and experienced workforce is essential to the success of any company. The same is true for us. Just as we compete with other companies in the insurance industry, we will also compete with other companies in the labor marketplace for employees. The overall objective of our executive compensation program will be to attract and retain effective, stable, and motivated leadership. We anticipate that the following core principles will guide compensation and benefits decisions for our named executive officers in connection with completing the offering consistent with our status as a public company:  A significant percentage of a named executive officers total direct compensation should be performance-based.  A significant percentage of the incentive compensation for our named executives should be provided using our stock instead of being tied to the overall value of Liberty Mutual Group.  A total rewards package should be strongly competitive with other size-appropriate companies in the insurance industry.  Our named executive officers should own a meaningful percentage of our stock that is intended to have them manage from a long-term owners perspective. In addition, we will be establishing short-term and long-term cash based incentive plans in light of the performance-based compensation exemption from the $1 million deduction limitation as may be considered appropriate and consistent with our business needs. We expect that our compensation committee will develop a formal executive compensation philosophy after the offering. Risk Assessment The metrics used by Liberty Mutual to calculate incentive payments for our named executive officers were part of a risk review that assesses the concentration of the underwriting risk of the Agency Markets business unit of Liberty Mutual by geography, industry and counterparty. We believe that we have sufficient controls and reviews in place so that an individual will not be able to underwrite levels of risk that would enhance compensation while jeopardizing our risk-return strategy. 2009 Liberty Mutual Executive Compensation Program Set forth below is a discussion of the Liberty Mutual executive compensation program that applied to our named executive officers during 2009. The total direct compensation paid by Liberty Mutual to our executive officers for 2009 had four components: base salary, an annual cash incentive award, a cash-based long-term incentive award and mutual company units providing an interest in Liberty Mutual Groups enterprise value. Base Salary. This component of total direct compensation represented twenty percent of the target level of total direct compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, and between thirty-eight percent and forty-seven percent for our other named executive officers during 2009. These salaries provide a secure base of compensation at a level reflecting the performance, skills and experience of our named executive officers while also ensuring that a significant portion of their compensation is at risk and linked to performance. Base salary levels were determined by Liberty Mutual after reviewing the competitive market (as measured by the relative base salary level paid to executives with similar levels of responsibility). Annual Cash Incentive Award. Each named executive officer received an award opportunity for 2009 under an annual incentive plan maintained by Liberty Mutual. Annual cash incentive award opportunities for 179 Table of Contents achieving target performance ranged from 19% to 25% of the target level of total direct compensation for our named executive officers. We anticipate replacing this plan with a new Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation annual cash incentive program that will cover our executive officers. The purpose of this program will be to create a strong link between annual performance-based compensation and business and individual performance during a calendar year in a manner that is consistent with our business plan and needs. All payments of annual incentives that are established under this program will be subject to the approval of our compensation committee. Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Award. Each named executive officer received an award opportunity for 2009 under a cash-based long-term incentive plan maintained by Liberty Mutual. This plan is structured so that payments are made if the applicable operating unit of Liberty Mutual outperformed its peer group over a three-year plan cycle. Performance measures under this plan were the growth of the Agency Markets business segment of Liberty Mutual (based on the increase in direct written premium) and combined ratio as compared against designated peers during a three-year plan cycle. The award opportunities for achieving target performance for the 2009  2011 plan cycle ranged from 10% to 20% of the target level of total direct compensation for our named executive officers. We anticipate replacing this plan with a separate cash-based long term incentive program that will cover our named executive officers. Payments under this program will depend upon the quality of our underwritten book of insurance business over time (as opposed to how funds are invested). All payments of long-term incentives that are established under this program will be subject to the approval of our compensation committee. Mutual Company Units (EPP/EPDCP). Our named executive officers have annually received grants of appreciation units and restricted units under the Liberty Mutual Executive Partnership Plan (EPP) and Liberty Mutual Executive Partnership Deferred Compensation Plan (EPDCP). Appreciation units provide a cash payment upon redemption that is tied to an increase in Liberty Mutual Groups overall value (rather than just the value of Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation) after the grant date; restricted units reflect a hypothetical interest in Liberty Mutual Groups overall value that may be redeemed for cash at predetermined times. Appreciation units and restricted units for 2009 represented between 22% and 35% of targeted total direct compensation for our named executive officers. It is not anticipated that Liberty Mutual will grant any additional appreciation units or restricted units to our named executive officers after the offering. The following table sets forth each element of total direct compensation as a percentage of the targeted level of total direct compensation for 2009: Targeted Total Direct Compensation(1) Salary Annual Long-Term (% of Incentive Incentive EPP/EPDCP Name Total) (% of Total)(2) (% of Total)(3) (% of Total)(4) Gary R. Gregg % % % % Michael J. Fallon % % % % Michael H. Hughes % % % % Scott R. Goodby % % % % Joseph A. Gilles % % % % (1) Equals the sum of a named executive officers salary and amount of incentive compensation at target as described in footnotes (2), (3) and (4) below. As used in this prospectus, direct compensation refers to the compensation actually received by own named executive officers for services delivered to us pursuant to services agreement with Liberty Mutual. (2) Equals the 2009 annual incentive target award for the named executive officer divided by the sum of his targeted total direct compensation. (3) Equals the payment that would be made at the end of the 2009  2011 plan cycle to the named executive officer if the target level of performance is achieved divided by the sum of his targeted total direct compensation. 180 Table of Contents (4) Equals the sum of the assigned dollar value of appreciation units and restricted units granted to the named executive officer under EPP and EPDCP for 2009 divided by the sum of his targeted total direct compensation. The dollar value of an appreciation unit is deemed to be 40% of the dollar value of a restricted unit for this purpose, and the dollar value for EPP and EPDCP grants is equally split between appreciation units and restricted units. In addition to total direct compensation, Liberty Mutual has historically provided the following additional benefits to our named executive officers: Health, Welfare and Retirement Plans. Our named executive officers are currently eligible to participate in Liberty Mutuals health and retirement benefit plans on the same basis as other salaried employees at Liberty Mutual. Effective as of January 1, 2011, we will establish our own retirement plan that mirrors the benefit formula under the Liberty Mutual retirement plan. It is anticipated that all of our employees after the offering, including our named executive officers, will continue to receive health benefits from Liberty Mutual that are the same as those offered to other salaried employees at Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual will continue to provide disability and death benefit coverage to our executive officers after the offering. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation. Our named executive officers currently participate in the Liberty Mutual Supplemental Income at Retirement Plan (SIRP). This plan reflects Liberty Mutuals belief that our named executive officers should be able to accrue company paid retirement benefits on the same basis as other salaried employees under Liberty Mutual Groups tax-qualified 401(k) plan and tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. SIRP allows eligible employees to defer a portion of their cash based compensation (other than under EPP/EPDCP) on a pre-tax basis. Deferrals of base salary and earned incentives in excess of tax-qualified plan limits are eligible for a matching contribution under SIRP at the same rate as under Liberty Mutual Groups tax-qualified 401(k) plan. In addition, amounts that cannot be accrued under the Liberty Mutual tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan due to tax-qualified plan limits are restored under the SIRP. Effective as of January 1, 2011, we expect to establish a nonqualified deferred compensation plan so that our named executive officers will continue to be able to accrue company paid retirement benefits on the same basis as other salaried employees. Post-Employment Compensation and Benefits. Liberty Mutual does not have employment agreements or change-in-control agreements with any of our named executive officers (except in the case of Michael H. Hughes, whose employment agreement was inherited from a prior acquisition) and we do not intend to use them in the foreseeable future. Any rights of our named executive officers to post-employment compensation and benefits will be covered by compensation and benefits plans. This method provides flexibility to amend or terminate a plan to adjust severance benefits in response to changing market conditions, as well as enhanced transparency. Liberty Mutual provides severance pay under a broad based severance plan on account of an involuntary termination of employment under certain circumstances. Individuals who become our employees on January 1, 2011 will continue to be covered under that plan. Providing severance benefits will assist us in recruiting from other companies where an executive has job security, tenure, and career opportunities. In accepting a position with us, an executive may be giving up his or her current job stability for the challenges and potential risks of a new position. Severance benefits mitigate the harm that the executive would suffer if his or her employment were terminated by us for reasons beyond such executives control. Severance benefits also allow executives to focus on our business without undue distraction regarding their job security. To be eligible to receive equity awards of our stock in connection with this offering (see  Equity Awards below), our named executive officers will be required to sign a covenant against working for certain competitors for a period of up to one year after employment termination. In addition, our named executive officers will be required to forfeit or repay the proceeds from some or all of their incentive awards due to certain types of conduct under a compensation recovery policy. Our named executive officers are currently subject to non-solicitation agreements with Liberty Mutual Group, and payment of severance benefits as described above requires the named executive officer to sign a general release. 181 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual does not, and we will not, provide tax gross-up payments to our named executive officers for any golden parachute excise taxes that may be assessed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with a change in control of either Liberty Mutual Group or us. Equity Awards We will be granting equity compensation to our named executive officers in connection with this offering. The form and amount of these awards and shares to be reserved for these awards are still under evaluation. Any equity awards that are granted in connection with this offering will be designed to serve as a significant retention incentive. Specifically, the initial equity awards to our named executive officers will generally impose a four year cliff vesting schedule. As discussed further below, we intend to establish stock ownership requirements for named executive officers to more closely align their interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders. All outstanding appreciation units under EPP will either be cashed out for an amount based on their then current unit value or cancelled and replaced with options to acquire our stock. The replacement stock options will reflect the same term and standard vesting terms as the cancelled appreciation units. Any restricted units will remain outstanding and subject to the terms of the EPDCP, which allows participants to change the deemed investment for vested restricted units from Liberty Mutual Groups value to designated notional fund investments. We intend to establish stock ownership requirements for our named executive officers to more closely align their interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We believe this commitment to stock ownership will play a significant role in driving our success and creating long-term stockholder value. While we have not formally established these requirements, we anticipate that our chief executive officer will be required, by a specified date, to acquire and hold stock with a value at least equal to five times his annual salary and that our other named executive officers will be required to acquire and hold stock with a value at least equal to three times their annual salary. Compensation Setting Process During 2009, the compensation committee of the Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc. board of directors (the LMHC Compensation Committee) engaged William M. Mercer, Inc. (Mercer) to provide competitive market ranges for Liberty Mutual Groups executive level positions, including the positions then held by our named executive officers. The LMHC Compensation Committee reviewed compensation practices for a peer group of insurance companies with Mercers assistance for executives in charge of a business segment, including Mr. Gregg. Specifically, the LMHC Compensation Committee reviewed base salary, annual incentives and total direct compensation for comparable executives at these public companies as a market check for Mr. Greggs compensation and our company performance. With respect to our other named executive officers, Mercer reviewed several surveys, including Mercers proprietary survey information and insurance industry surveys. This data was compiled by Mercer in order to provide an important reference point and market check when determining compensation for our other named executive officers. The named executive officers base salary, annual incentive targets and total direct compensation were found to be appropriate at that time given their respective skills, breadth of experience and duties and responsibilities. Our named executive officers received appreciation units under EPP and restricted units under EPDCP in 2009 based on a pool established by Liberty Mutual for granting awards to executives at Liberty Mutual. This pool was allocated to executive level classes based on job responsibilities, and each executive within a class receives the same number of appreciation units and restricted units regardless of individual performance. As noted above, our named executive officers will receive equity awards using our stock going forward, and it is not anticipated that they will receive any further appreciation unit or restricted unit awards. The LMHC Compensation Committee will not determine the compensation for our named executive officers after the offering. Instead, these compensation determinations will be made by our compensation committee. New short-term and long-term incentive plans, an equity compensation plan and non-qualified deferred compensation plans are currently under evaluation and will be established in connection with this 182 Table of Contents offering. We anticipate that the equity compensation plan will authorize the grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other forms of equity compensation.

In addition, any transaction with directors, officers or other affiliates will be subject to requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC rules and regulations. Historical Relationship with Liberty Mutual As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual, we and our subsidiaries have received various services provided by Liberty Mutual and its affiliates, including: accounting and reporting; actuarial; administration; advertising and communications; administration of our run-off liabilities; employee relations and benefits and human resources; information technology; investment management; legal and litigation management; payroll processing; purchasing; real estate management; policy administration; regulatory compliance; reinsurance; risk management; tax; treasury; underwriting and other services. Our historical financial statements include allocations to us and our subsidiaries by Liberty Mutual and its affiliates of their costs related to these services. These cost allocations have been determined on a basis that Liberty Mutual considers to be a reasonable reflection of the use of services provided or the benefits received by us and our subsidiaries. This allocation totaled $ , $ and $ in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The Transactions  February 2010 Note. On February 3, 2010, we declared and paid a dividend to Liberty Mutual in the form of a note payable in the aggregate principal amount of $4 billion due February 29, 2012, bearing interest at an annual rate of 0.72%. Prior to completion of this offering, we expect to repay approximately $ million of principal amount of the February 2010 Note as part of the special 186 Table of Contents dividends described below and expect to repay an additional $ from the net proceeds of this offering.  Settlement of Affiliate Payable Balance. In March 2010 we paid Liberty Mutual $1.007 billion in cash and investments to settle the payable outstanding as a result of the termination of reinsurance agreements between a subsidiary of ours and insurance company subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual. In connection with the reinsurance agreements, Liberty Mutual previously paid us $1.026 billion in cash and investments in 2008 which we recorded as a deposit.  Retirement of Subsidiary Preferred Stock. In April 2010, Liberty Mutual contributed to us all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock issued by Safeco in December 2008, all of which were subsequently contributed to Safeco and were retired. In April 2010, Liberty Mutual and PIC contributed to Ohio Casualty all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock issued by Ohio Casualty, all of which were immediately retired.  Ohio Casualty Note. Prior to the consummation of this offering we will declare and pay a dividend to Liberty Mutual in the form of a purchase note in connection with Liberty Mutuals transfer of Ohio Casualty to us in the aggregate principal amount of $ billion due , bearing interest at an annual rate of %. Prior to completion of this offering we expect to repay approximately $ million of principal amount of the Ohio Casualty Note as part of the special distributions described below and expect to repay an additional $ from the net proceeds of this offering, which amount assumes each share of Class A common stock is sold at a price equal to the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus.  Special Distributions and Payments. Prior to consummation of this offering, we expect to make one or more special distributions to Liberty Mutual in the aggregate amount of $ of cash and invested assets. We also intend to pay Liberty Mutual $125 million in connection with entering into the Run-off Indemnification Agreement with Liberty Mutual in of 2010, as described below. Other Transactions In of 2010, we entered into and expect to enter into several legal entity movements to realign our company structure such that all of the stock of Ohio Casualty will be owned by us, and the stock of Summit Holdings Southeast, Inc. will be owned by Liberty Mutual. On March 26, 2010, one of our top tier insurance subsidiaries, PIC, entered into a $250 million three-year committed repurchase agreement facility for general corporate purposes. The repurchase facility is guaranteed by Liberty Mutual. To date, no funds have been borrowed under the repurchase facility. Services Agreements Current Arrangement Although we currently do not, and until at least January 1, 2011, will not, have any employees, Liberty Mutual provides us with the services of approximately 11,000 Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees. Liberty Mutual has agreed to transfer to us all of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees on January 1, 2011, which excludes information technology and other corporate shared services function employees who will continue to provide services to us under the Services Agreement. Historically, we, our subsidiaries and our controlled affiliates have relied on Liberty Mutual to provide the necessary services for us to conduct our business. The agreements and arrangements governing these services are described below. The agreements between Liberty Mutual and us were entered into when we and our subsidiaries were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual. The majority of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees are employed by LMGI and LMIC, subsidiaries of Liberty Mutual. LMGI and LMIC are party to a management services agreement, effective as of January 1, 2009, which we refer to in this prospectus as the Liberty MSA. Under the Liberty MSA, LMGI provides services to LMIC and any of its affiliates to which LMIC is obligated to provide services. 187 Table of Contents LMGI charges LMIC its cost (excluding the costs associated with personnel principally engaged in corporate finance, human resources and investments), plus an annual fee of 1% of the sum of direct written premiums and annuity considerations reported on the combined statutory annual statement of LMIC and its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates and the statutory annual statement of Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston. This reporting group includes us and our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates. The Liberty MSA has an initial term of two years and automatically is extended for additional two-year terms unless a party provides a notice of cancellation. Either party may terminate the Liberty MSA by providing 180 days prior written notice to the other party. LMGI is permitted to subcontract for any of the services provided under the Liberty MSA, but neither party may assign the entire Liberty MSA without the prior written consent of the other party. The Liberty MSA is governed under Massachusetts law. Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates have entered into services agreements, which we refer to in this prospectus as the Liberty-Agency Services Agreements, with LMIC for LMIC to perform such services for our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates as they determine are reasonably necessary or desirable in the conduct of their respective operations. We currently receive the services necessary for our business through the Liberty-Agency Services Agreements. LMIC generally is required to perform the services at a level that is at least equal to its standards for performing such services on behalf of its own insurance operations and in accordance with and subject to applicable law. The Liberty-Agency Services Agreements may generally be terminated without cause by either party upon 90 days prior written notice or by mutual agreement. In addition, the Liberty-Agency Services Agreements may be terminated immediately for a material failure by LMIC to perform the services in accordance with the required standards that is not cured within 30 days, our non-payment of costs to LMIC, the suspension, revocation or other restriction on the licenses of either LMIC or our insurance subsidiary or controlled affiliate party thereto, the insolvency, voluntary bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation of either LMIC or our insurance subsidiary or controlled affiliate party thereto, upon the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates by a third party from LMIC or any other change in control which causes LMIC to no longer maintain a majority on the board of directors of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates. The Liberty-Agency Services Agreements may only be amended upon the written agreement of both parties thereto. Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are required to reimburse LMIC for the reasonable costs of the services performed under the Liberty-Agency Services Agreements, including direct expenses incurred by LMIC under the Liberty MSA, and directly allocable expenses allocated to our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates by LMIC in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied and applicable statutory accounting guidance as promulgated by the NAIC (SSAP No. 70). We intend, subject to the receipt of any necessary insurance regulatory approvals, to terminate the existing Liberty-Agency Services Agreements and enter into new services agreements between PIC, as the service provider, and our other insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, as soon as the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees are transferred to us on January 1, 2011. PIC also provides services to our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates under a services agreement which we refer to in this prospectus as the Agency Corporation Services Agreement. Since PIC does not have any employees, PIC relies on the services provided indirectly by LMGI under the Liberty MSA and LMIC under the Liberty-Agency Services Agreements to provide services to our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates under the Agency Corporation Services Agreement. We intend, subject to the receipt of any necessary insurance regulatory approvals, to terminate the Agency Corporation Services Agreement as soon as the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees are transferred to us on January 1, 2011. Through the Liberty-Agency Services Agreements, we have made aggregate payments to Liberty Mutual during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $1.806 billion, $1.020 billion and $0.799 billion, respectively. Surety Services Agreement In connection with our Surety segments business, we have entered into a reciprocal claims services agreement with Liberty Mutual under which the parties agreed to combine their claims operations for surety business and for Liberty Mutual Groups Liberty Bond Services division (now our Surety segment) to direct 188 Table of Contents and supervise the combined claims operations for Liberty Mutual Groups surety business. Each party is responsible for payment of their own unallocated loss adjustment expenses. Allocated loss adjustment expenses, as well as any losses incurred in connection with a transferred claim, are the responsibility of the party transferring such claim. This agreement may be modified or terminated at any time at the sole and absolute discretion of our Surety segment. Under the reciprocal claims services agreement, we did not make any payments to Liberty Mutual for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Liberty Mutual has made aggregate payments to us under the reciprocal claims services agreement during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $42 million, $22 million and $16 million, respectively. We intend, subject to the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, to amend this agreement effective as of January 1, 2011 to reflect the transfer of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees to us. Miscellaneous Related Party Service Agreements A small amount of our Commercial and Personal segments business is written through affiliates of Liberty Mutual either because these affiliates were at one time members of the LMAC Pool, provide our Commercial and Personal segments with increased flexibility as to pricing or terms, or allow us to address more effectively a particular policyholders multi-state coverage needs. In each instance, we have entered into a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with the affiliate to cover that business. See  Reinsurance Agreements  Quota Share Relationships. In connection with this business, we have entered agreements under which we service the business ceded to us or the LMAC Pool. We currently have one such services agreement in place with Liberty Mutual Mid-Atlantic Insurance Company, which we refer to in this prospectus as LMMAIC, pursuant to which we provide, with respect to our business written through LMMAIC, sales and underwriting, claims management, reinsurance recovery, ancillary insurance and reinsurance, accounting, tax and auditing, litigation, corporate, management information systems, actuarial, agent and broker-related, regulatory communications, treasury, management reporting, accounts receivable, external communications, internal communications, legal, general business and miscellaneous services. In performing these services, we are generally permitted to retain such legal, financial, actuarial and other advisors and services providers, including affiliates of Liberty Mutual, as we reasonably deem necessary to provide such services. We are required to perform the services in a commercially reasonable manner and in accordance with customary industry standards and applicable law. The agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement and either party may generally terminate the agreement upon 180 days prior written notice to the other party or upon 45 days written notice to the other party if the other party becomes subject to the state insolvency laws of its jurisdiction of domicile. In addition, we may terminate the management agreement if LMMAIC fails to make any payments owed to us under the agreement and such failure is not cured within 30 days after the date such payment is due. Liberty Mutual may terminate the agreement if we materially breach the terms and conditions of the agreement and such breach is not cured within 45 days following our written notice of such breach. The agreement automatically terminates if LMMAIC is no longer affiliated with Liberty Mutual or no longer is a party to Liberty Mutuals intercompany reinsurance pool or if Liberty Mutual no longer maintains a majority of the board of directors of LMMAIC. The agreement may not be assigned or transferred without the prior written consent of the other party and may not be amended or otherwise modified except by a written document executed by both parties. LMMAIC is required to reimburse us for the cost of all services provided under this management agreement. LMMAIC has made aggregate payments for costs and expenses to us under the agreement during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $0, $5 million and $6 million, respectively. We have made aggregate payments to LMMAIC under the agreement during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $0.3 million, $0 and $0, respectively. In connection with this offering and subject to applicable regulatory approval, we anticipate entering into similar agreements with Liberty Mutual where we have such quota share agreements currently in place. We also have entered into a services agreement with Liberty Mutual in connection with a now-terminated quota share agreement related to multi-state accommodation business that was written on our behalf because, at the time, some multi-state business could be written more efficiently through affiliates of Liberty Mutual and reinsured by us. Although the reinsurance agreement has been terminated, the services agreement pursuant 189 Table of Contents to which Liberty Mutual provides us with services related to that business is still in effect. The ongoing services related to the business include claims management, reinsurance recovery support, litigation services, reporting, accounts receivable, licensing, general business and additional miscellaneous services. In performing the services under the agreement, Liberty Mutual may retain such legal, financial, actuarial and other advisors and services providers, including other affiliates of Liberty Mutual, to provide such services. Liberty Mutual is required to act in good faith, in a commercially reasonably manner and in accordance with customary industry standards and applicable laws in providing the service. We and Liberty Mutual each may generally terminate the agreement upon mutual agreement or upon 90 days prior written notice to the other or upon 45 days prior written notice if the other becomes subject to insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation. Liberty Mutual may terminate the services agreement upon written notice if we fail to make payments required under the agreement and such failure is not cured within 30 days after the date such payment is due. We may terminate the agreement if Liberty Mutual materially breaches the terms and conditions of the agreement and such breach is not cured within 45 days following written notice. The agreement may not be assigned or transferred without the prior written consent of the other party and may not be amended or otherwise modified except by a written document executed by both parties. We have made aggregate payments for costs and expenses to Liberty Mutual under the agreement during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $0 million, $2 million and $2 million, respectively. We and Liberty Mutual intend to enter into two claims services agreements, pursuant to which we will provide Liberty Mutual with workers compensation claims management services in the states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington with respect to Liberty Mutuals middle markets, national markets and third-party administrator business. These services include receipt, processing, settlement and payment of claims, acknowledgment of receipt of policyholder notices, investigation of claims, complaint response, benefit reporting, engagement of claims counsel and defense of disputed claims. The agreements are terminable by either party upon 90 days written notice or at any time upon the parties mutual written agreement. The agreements will be effective retroactive to January 1, 2010, upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and replace a memorandum of understanding covering the provision of claims services to Liberty Mutual in these states. We have received aggregate payments from Liberty Mutual under the memorandum of understanding and these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $5 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively. We and Liberty Mutual intend to enter into a claims services agreement, pursuant to which Liberty Mutual will provide us with workers compensation claims management services on a non-exclusive basis for large accounts generally serviced by our Commercial segments Liberty Northwest region, but with locations outside of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. These services include receipt, processing, settlement and payment of claims, acknowledgment of receipt of policyholder notices, investigation of claims, complaint response, benefit reporting, engagement of claims counsel and defense of disputed claims. For 2010, we will pay Liberty Mutual a per claim charge of $2,374 for workers compensation indemnity claims, $130 for workers compensation only medical expense claims and $76 for when a record of a potential claim only is made. Service fees for subsequent years are subject to the parties mutual agreement. The agreement is terminable by either party upon 90 days written notice or at any time upon the parties mutual written agreement. The agreement formalizes our service relationship and will be effective retroactively to January 1, 2010, upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. We have made aggregate payments to Liberty Mutual under the relationship and agreement during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $17 million, $20 million, $27 million, respectively. Reinsurance Agreements Our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are direct or indirect participants in the LMAC Pool intercompany pooling arrangement. See Business  Intercompany Pooling Arrangement. Quota Share Relationships We have entered into a reinsurance agreement with Liberty Mutual pursuant to which Liberty Mutual cedes 100% of Liberty Mutuals risk issued under surety bonds issued through Liberty Mutual Groups surety 190 Table of Contents business unit (Surety Reinsurance Agreement). We are required to reimburse Liberty Mutual for 100% of the losses after external reinsurance, expenses (including commissions), assessments, taxes and dividends attributed to the risks reinsured under the agreement, including loss adjustment expenses, unearned premiums and any other assets or liabilities attributable to risks assumed under the agreement, and to maintain reserves for 100% of the Liberty Mutuals liabilities attributable to the ceded risks. Liberty Mutual is required to pay us a reinsurance premium equal to 100% of Liberty Mutuals premium attributable to the risks reinsured. The agreement may be terminated on a prospective basis by either party upon 120 days prior written notice or by mutual agreement of the parties. Following any termination of Surety Reinsurance Agreement, we remain liable with respect to all cessions in force as of the termination. The Surety Reinsurance Agreement will be amended and restated in connection with this offering. See  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement discussed below. We have also entered into 100% quota share agreements with Liberty Mutual that cover a small property and casualty business written by Liberty Mutual affiliates on our behalf either because the Liberty Mutual affiliates were at one time members of the LMAC Pool, the arrangement allows us flexibility as to pricing or terms, or allow us to address more effectively particular policyholders multi-state coverage needs. These include quota share agreements between PIC, as reinsurer, and Insurance Company of Illinois, Liberty Mutual Mid-Atlantic Insurance Company and Liberty County Mutual Insurance Company, subsidiaries or controlled affiliates of Liberty Mutual, as well as a quota share agreement among Liberty Northwest Insurance Corporation, one of our insurance subsidiaries, and various Liberty Mutual affiliates. These arrangements allow business of ours produced by Liberty Mutual affiliates on our behalf to be ceded to the LMAC Pool. We also have entered into a reinsurance agreement between Golden Eagle Insurance Corporation, which we refer to in this prospectus as GEIC, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and a member of the LMAC Pool, and Liberty Mutual, pursuant to which Liberty Mutual reinsures 100% of GEICs risks under workers compensation policies directly written by GEIC and ceded to Liberty Mutual during the term of the agreement. Liberty Mutual is required to reimburse GEIC for losses, expenses, assessments, taxes and dividends attributable to the reinsured risks and maintain reserves for 100% of GEICs liabilities attributable to the risks reinsured. GEIC is required to pay Liberty Mutual 100% of the premiums attributed to the reinsured risks to LMIC as a reinsurance premium. The agreement may be terminated by either party on 120 days written notice or by mutual agreement. Liberty Mutual will remain liable with respect to all ceded risks in force as of termination. We have entered into a quota share reinsurance contract with Liberty Mutual pursuant to which Liberty Mutual assumes 100% of our net retained liability for policies issued and in-force on or after January 1, 2010, that is related to designated business or programs that we have decided to exit, which came to us as a result of acquisitions or which we no longer are actively pursuing. This includes exited non-standard automobile business, pre-acquisition Ohio Casualty personal lines service center business, legacy Ohio Casualty  exited California commercial lines business, guaranteed renewals of a legacy Ohio Casualty major medical program and exited errors and omissions, general liability, workers compensation and construction defect business that we acquired through the Safeco acquisition, among other programs. The agreement may be terminated by either party on 30 days written notice or by mutual agreement. Liberty Mutual will remain liable with respect to all ceded risks in force as of termination. We also have entered into a property and casualty quota share retrocession agreement with Liberty Mutual, as reinsurer, pursuant to which Liberty Mutual assumes 100% of those risks ceded to us by Liberty Insurance Underwriters, Inc., which we refer to in this prospectus as LIUI, and which risks are attributable to policies of insurance issued or assumed by LIUI prior to January 1, 2000. Under the terms of this property and casualty quota share retrocession agreement, we pay Liberty Mutual 100% of the net written premium we receive that is specifically allocable to LIUI. Ceding commissions, net reserves, premiums and expenses due to and from us with respect to the risks covered follow the expense reimbursement provisions under the LMAC Pool, to which the property and casualty quota share retrocession agreement is subject. The duration and termination provisions of this agreement also follow those of the LMAC Pool. 191 Table of Contents We have made aggregate payments to Liberty Mutual under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $177 million, $212 million and $201 million, respectively. We have received aggregate payments from Liberty Mutual under the these agreement during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $289 million, $305 million and $275 million, respectively. Current Reinsurance Program Effective January 1, 2010, we entered into a property catastrophe treaty reinsurance program with Liberty Mutual that covers 90% of losses between $500 million and $1.325 billion. In the event of a catastrophe, our property catastrophe reinsurance program can be reinstated for the remainder of the original contract term by paying a reinstatement premium that is based on a percentage of the coverage reinstated and the original property catastrophe coverage premium. Our property catastrophe reinsurance program does not cover personal or commercial property losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism as defined by the Terrorism Acts. However, the program does cover personal and commercial property losses resulting from non-certified acts of terrorism occurring within the United States and carried out by United States citizens, provided the losses were not caused by radioactive, nuclear, biological or chemical attacks. The agreement will terminate on January 1, 2011 or upon the occurrence of certain events generally related to Liberty Mutuals financial condition, regulatory good standing, and ability or intent to continue conducting reinsurance business. For multiple workers compensation losses arising from a single occurrence, effective January 1, 2010, we entered into a workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance program with Liberty Mutual to cover 55% of workers compensation losses between $100 million and $300 million. The program covers losses that arise out of natural disasters and certified acts of terrorism under the Terrorism Acts, unless the losses result from radioactive, nuclear, biological or chemical attacks. In the event of a catastrophe, our workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance program can be reinstated for the remainder of the original contract term by paying a reinstatement premium that is based on a percentage of the coverage reinstated and the original workers compensation catastrophe coverage premium. The agreement will terminate on January 1, 2011 or upon the occurrence of certain events generally related to Liberty Mutuals financial condition, regulatory good standing, and ability or intent to continue conducting reinsurance business. Effective January 1, 2010, we entered into a commercial equipment breakdown quota share reinsurance contract with Liberty Mutual, as reinsurer, pursuant to which Liberty Mutual assumes, subject to a maximum limit of liability of $100 million any one accident, 100% of our liability for new and renewal commercial equipment breakdown business issued through all our underwriting systems, other than those designated by us as AQS Mecca (used across our Commercial segment), CommLine (which we use for former Safeco commercial lines business); and PAL (which is used by our Commercial segments Liberty Northwest region). The contract was amended effective April 1, 2010 to include CommLine and PAL. AQS Mecca will be added effective June 1, 2010. The contract contains a profit sharing plan pursuant to which we may be eligible to receive annual profit sharing and bonus incentives based on the performance of ceded business. The contract may be terminated by either party with 180 days written notice, in which case Liberty Mutual will remain, at our option, liable with respect to all ceded risks in force as of termination. The contract will also terminate upon the occurrence of certain events generally related to Liberty Mutuals financial condition, regulatory good standing, and ability or intent to continue conducting reinsurance business. Terminated or Expired Reinsurance Programs As a member of Liberty Mutual Group, we have had occasion to enter into reinsurance agreements with Liberty Mutual affiliates, both as cedent and as reinsurer, in connection with our business operations. These agreements include: Our insurance subsidiaries as cedent:  Property per risk excess of loss program;  Property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program;  Casualty excess of loss reinsurance program; 192 Table of Contents  Commercial umbrella excess of loss reinsurance program;  Workers compensation catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program;  Workers compensation clash excess of loss reinsurance program; and  Reinsurance treaties designed to remove business from the LMAC Pool that Liberty Mutual no longer deemed to be part of our business. Our insurance subsidiaries as reinsurer:  Reinsurance treaties designed to cede multi-state business written on our behalf by Liberty Mutual affiliates as an accommodation to us into the LMAC Pool;  Inter affiliate reinsurance programs covering periods of time when certain operations were part of part of our business, such as umbrella quota share, casualty excess of loss, property per risk, workers compensation excess of loss, and workers compensation catastrophe excess of loss programs; and  Programs where we provided reinsurance coverage to Liberty Mutual, but solely as a result of our acquisition of a previously unrelated party (e.g., Safeco). Each of these agreements has expired by its own terms or has been terminated by the parties and, as a result, no longer is in force. However, the parties continue to settle losses and provide payments under these agreements related to the period of time during which the agreements were effective. We have made aggregate payments to Liberty Mutual under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $90 million, $90 million and $66 million, respectively. We have received aggregate payments from Liberty Mutual under the these agreement during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $53 million, $85 million and $41 million, respectively. Investment Management Agreements Historically, our insurance subsidiaries have entered into investment management agreements with certain affiliates of Liberty Mutual, as investment advisors, for the management of our investment portfolios. These agreements authorized Liberty Mutual, in its discretion, to invest and manage our assets, subject to the investment policies and guidelines provided by our insurance subsidiaries. Liberty Mutual received monthly management fees in an amount equal to the product of the average market value of the securities under management for the month and 0.0000283, or approximately 3.4 basis points on an annual basis. As a result of an internal personnel reorganization at Liberty Mutual, the determination that investment services should be priced at actual cost rather than a historical rate significantly below cost and the desire to update the investment management agreements to reflect terms typically contained in third party agreements, beginning in 2010 agreements between our insurance subsidiaries and affiliates of Liberty Mutual were amended and restated, terminated or new agreements were entered into. Currently, all of our insurance subsidiaries have entered into investment management agreements with affiliates of Liberty Mutual, as investment advisor, for the management of their investment portfolios. Liberty Mutual is authorized in its discretion to invest, reinvest and manage the assets of our subsidiaries, subject to the investment policies and guidelines provided in the applicable investment management agreements which specify permissible asset classes, asset concentrations, and provide for securities lending activities. The investment management agreements may be modified upon mutual written agreement of the investment advisors and our insurance subsidiaries and may only be assigned with the consent of the other party. The investment management agreements permit Liberty Mutual to delegate any of their responsibilities, duties and authority under the investment management agreements and to otherwise utilize the investment management services of any of their affiliates in performing their obligations under the investment management agreements. The investment advisors may terminate the investment management agreements upon 180 days written notice to our insurance subsidiaries and our insurance subsidiaries may terminate the investment management agreements upon written notice to the investment advisor. The investment advisors receive quarterly management fees in an amount equal to the product of the average GAAP market value of the cash and securities under management for the quarter and 0.00045, or 18 basis points, on an annual basis. Our insurance subsidiaries have incurred management fees to Liberty Mutual 193 Table of Contents under these investment management agreements during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of approximately $6.8 million, $4.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Cash Management Agreement Certain of our insurance subsidiaries have entered into cash management agreements with Liberty Mutual under which Liberty Mutual makes, holds and administers short-term investments that are permitted under the insurance laws of their respective jurisdictions of domicile. Short-term investments are considered to be investments maturing within 365 days of their purchase and permitted investments are further enumerated in an exhibit to each cash management agreement. The investments under management are held in a common account with short-term investments of Liberty Mutuals insurance subsidiaries and our other insurance subsidiaries that also have cash management agreements with Liberty Mutual. Under the cash management agreement, any withdrawals by our insurance subsidiaries must be settled within 10 business days. These agreements generally may be terminated by our insurance subsidiaries at the end of any business day upon prior written notice to Liberty Mutual or by Liberty Mutual upon 180 days written notice to the applicable insurance subsidiary. Each cash management agreement may only be assigned by our insurance subsidiaries with the prior written consent of Liberty Mutual and shall automatically terminate if the successor to our insurance subsidiary that is a party to such agreement is not also an insurance company. The agreement may only be amended in writing signed by each of the parties thereto. Historically, our insurance subsidiaries were required to pay Liberty Mutual reasonable compensation for the services rendered under the cash management agreements, which amount was determined to be approximately 3.4 basis points on an annual basis, consistent with the investment management agreements between our insurance subsidiaries and Liberty Mutual. Beginning in 2010, the cash management agreements were amended and restated to incorporate terms consistent with the changes made to the investment management agreements. The management fee was similarly revised to be on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to the product of the average GAAP market value of the cash and short term securities under management for the quarter and 0.00045, or 18 basis points, on an annual basis. Our insurance subsidiaries have incurred management fees and expenses to Liberty Mutual under these cash management agreements during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of approximately $0.135 million, $0.065 million and $0.053 million, respectively. Credit Facilities Revolving Loan Agreements Some of our insurance subsidiaries are parties to separate intercompany revolving loan agreements with Liberty Mutual. Pursuant to these agreements, we may borrow up to $630 million in aggregate. These agreements were entered into on May 22, 2006 (except for one entered into on November 8, 2007) and expire on May 22, 2011 (except for one expiring on November 8, 2012). We pay no commitment fee to Liberty Mutual to maintain these revolving lines of credit. If our subsidiaries borrow funds under these agreements, the interest rate will be based on Liberty Mutuals cost of funds and in any event will be no greater than a specified rate (for agreements with borrowing limits of $480 million, the maximum rate is the average prime rate plus 5%; and for agreements with borrowing limits of $150 million, the maximum rate is three-month LIBOR plus 0.75%). At December 31, 2009, our subsidiaries had no loans outstanding under these lines of credit and have never had any amounts outstanding under these lines of credit. Tax Sharing Agreement We have been included in Liberty Mutual Groups consolidated group (the Consolidated Group) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as in certain consolidated, combined or unitary groups that include Liberty Mutual and/or certain of its subsidiaries (a Combined Group) for foreign, state and local income tax purposes. We have a tax sharing agreement with Liberty Mutual pursuant to which we and Liberty Mutual generally make payments to each other such that, with respect to tax returns for any taxable period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Group, the amount of taxes to be paid by us is determined, subject to certain adjustments, as if we and each of our subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Group filed our tax returns separate from the Consolidated Group. If we generate a loss that is used by Liberty 194 Table of Contents Mutual, Liberty Mutual compensates us for that loss when it could have been carried back by us to produce a refund or carried forward by us to reduce our taxable income. Under the Intercompany Agreement, the principles of the tax sharing agreement will also apply for purposes of any tax return in which we or any of our subsidiaries are included in Liberty Mutuals Combined Group. We are responsible for any taxes with respect to tax returns that include only us and our subsidiaries. In addition, by virtue of its controlling ownership and the existing tax sharing agreement, Liberty Mutual effectively controls substantially all of our tax decisions and has sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings, including tax audits relating to Liberty Mutuals consolidated or combined income tax returns in which we are included. It is anticipated that the tax sharing agreement will continue to be administered in a manner that is consistent with past practices. We have been included in the Consolidated Group for periods in which Liberty Mutual owned at least 80% of the total voting power and value of our outstanding stock. It is expected that we will be included in the Consolidated Group following this offering. Each member of a consolidated group during any part of a consolidated return year is severally liable for the tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently determined deficiency thereon. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, each member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group for state, local or foreign income tax purposes is severally liable for the state, local or foreign income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated, combined or unitary group. Accordingly, although tax liabilities are allocated between us and Liberty Mutual, for any period in which we were included in the Consolidated Group or Combined Group, we could be liable in the event that any income tax liability was incurred, but not discharged, by any other member of the Consolidated Group or Combined Group. Other Debt Obligations with Liberty Mutual On December 29, 2008, LMGI, a subsidiary of Liberty Mutual, exchanged:  $281 million of the outstanding $300 million Safeco 4.875% Senior Notes due 2010 for a like principal amount of newly issued LMGI 4.875% Senior Notes due 2010;  $187 million of the outstanding $204 million Safeco 7.25% Senior Notes due 2012 for a like principal amount of newly issued LMGI 7.25% Senior Notes due 2012; and  $180 million of the outstanding $200 million Ohio Casualty 7.30% Senior Notes due 2014 for a like principal amount of newly issued LMGI 7.30% Senior Notes due 2014.

Ohio Casualty, along with Liberty Mutual, is named as a guarantor of the $180 million outstanding LMGI 7.30% Senior Notes due 2014. Liberty Mutual as our Controlling Stockholder Liberty Mutual currently beneficially owns 100% of our common stock. Upon completion of this offering, Liberty Mutual will beneficially hold approximately % of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock (or approximately % if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full). Liberty Mutual will be able to direct the election of 80% of the members of our board of directors unless, prior to any distribution intended to qualify as a tax-free spin-off, Liberty Mutual ceases to own shares of Class B common stock representing at least 20% of our outstanding common stock. For as long as Liberty Mutual continues to control more than 50% of the combined voting power of our common stock, Liberty Mutual will be able to direct the election of all the members of our board of directors and exercise control over our business and affairs, including any determination with respect to mergers or other business combinations involving us, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities, and the payment of dividends with respect to our common stock. Similarly, Liberty Mutual will have the power to determine matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders without the consent of our other stockholders, will have the power to prevent a change in control of us and will have the power to take other actions that might not be favorable our other stockholders. 195 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual has agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any of our common stock for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions. See Underwriting. Liberty Mutual currently does not intend to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it will beneficially hold following this offering. However, there can be no assurance concerning the period of time during which Liberty Mutual will maintain its ownership of our common stock following this offering. Beneficial ownership of at least 80% of the total voting power and value of our outstanding common stock is required in order for Liberty Mutual to continue to include us in its consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and beneficial ownership of at least 80% of the total voting power and 80% of the shares of each class of non-voting capital stock is required in order for Liberty Mutual to effect a tax-free spin-off of us or certain other tax-free transactions. As of the date of this prospectus, Liberty Mutual does not intend or plan to undertake a spin-off of us or another tax-free transaction involving us. It is expected that we will be included in Liberty Mutuals consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the offering.

We have agreed that, to the extent permitted by the NYSE and so long as Liberty Mutual beneficially owns at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, Liberty Mutual may purchase its pro rata share, based on its then-current percentage equity interest in us, of any voting equity security issued by us, excluding any securities offered in connection with dividend reinvestment plans, this offering and under employee stock options or other benefit plans (unless any such issuance would cause Liberty Mutuals beneficial ownership to go below certain thresholds). Employees. We currently do not have any employees. All of our services are provided by employees of Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer all of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees to us as of January 1, 2011. Employee Benefits. Following the transfer of the Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees to us on January 1, 2011, Liberty Mutual will allow us to participate in certain of the Liberty Mutual benefit and welfare plans, such as medical benefits and others as a participating employer. Our continued participation shall be at the sole discretion of Liberty Mutual. We have agreed that until Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock our benefit and welfare plans, including any pension plan or other retirement benefit plans, will be the same as the Liberty Mutual benefit and welfare plans. We have generally agreed to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all employment or service-related liabilities with respect to Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees and other employees dedicated to our business for the periods that they were dedicated to our business, whether before or after this issuance. Liberty Mutual has generally agreed to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all employment or service-related liabilities with respect to any Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees or other employees of Liberty Mutual for periods during that they were not dedicated to our business, whether before or after this issuance. 199 Table of Contents Right of First Offer. We have agreed with Liberty Mutual that until two years after the first date Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions, Liberty Mutual will have the right of first offer to provide us with any property and casualty coverage (including reinsurance). In addition, during such period, before we enter into an arrangement with a third party to provide us with property and casualty coverage (including reinsurance), we must provide Liberty Mutual the opportunity to provide us with the same coverage on the same terms as such third party. We will not be required to purchase the coverage at rates, terms or conditions less favorable than those offered by any third party at the time of the offer. However, we may not unreasonably reject any offer by Liberty Mutual, and if we reject an offer by Liberty Mutual, we may not enter into an agreement with a third party on substantially the same terms and rates. Allocation of Coverage under the Terrorism Acts . We have agreed with Liberty Mutual that as long as our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are affiliates of Liberty Mutuals insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates for purposes of the Terrorism Acts, any recoveries of compensation from the Federal government for any program year under the Terrorism Acts will be allocated among the affiliated insurers in the same proportion in which each such insurers insured losses (net of collectible reinsurance) under the Terrorism Acts bear to the total insured losses (net of collectible reinsurance) for all of the affiliated insurers for the program year under the Terrorism Acts to which the recoveries relate. For purposes of these provisions, collectible reinsurance excludes intercompany pooling or affiliate quota share reinsurance. The allocation of recoveries under the Terrorism Acts will terminate immediately upon the mutual written agreement of all of the affiliated insurers and automatically as to any insurer that ceases to be an affiliate of any other insurer for purposes of the Terrorism Acts, although the agreement to allocate recoveries will continue to apply to any such insurer through year end of the program year in which the termination took place. The agreement to allocate recoveries also terminates automatically upon the expiration of the Terrorism Acts. See Business  Terrorism. Fronting Commitment. For as long as Liberty Mutual owns more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, Liberty Mutual has agreed to cause its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates through which we currently write business to continue to allow us to write such business. Enterprise Risk Management. Our certificate of incorporation and the Intercompany Agreement will provide that for as long as Liberty Mutual beneficially owns at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, we are required to jointly manage our enterprise risk with Liberty Mutual (including, but not limited to, exposure to underwriting risks related to natural and other catastrophes, credit risk in our investment portfolios, insurance operations and otherwise and other risks that are of a nature subject to the oversight of Liberty Mutuals enterprise risk management committee) on a consolidated basis with and as determined by Liberty Mutual. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, and waive any claim with respect to, any business opportunity that may otherwise be available to us were enterprise risk management not so managed. Shared Corporate Services. Until the date Liberty Mutual ceases to own more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, unless otherwise consented to by Liberty Mutual in writing, we shall obtain the services provided for under the Services Agreement from one or more members of the Liberty Mutual Group and shall not reduce the scope of such services unless (i) otherwise consented to by Liberty Mutual, (ii) the Services Agreement terminates for any reason other than (A) a termination by Liberty Mutual for any uncured material breach by us or (B) a termination without cause by us on 180 days notice or (iii) Liberty Mutual has reduced the scope of services provided under the Services Agreement other than at our direction.

Dispute Resolution. The Intercompany Agreement generally provides that the parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of disputes arising in connection with the Intercompany Agreement without resorting to arbitration. If these efforts are not successful, the dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Intercompany Agreement, which provides for the selection of a three-arbitrator panel and the conduct of the arbitration hearing. Both we and Liberty Mutual will be permitted to seek a preliminary injunction or other provisional judicial remedy, if in either partys reasonable judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable harm. Further Actions and Assurances. We have agreed that, at any time after the date of the Intercompany Agreement and prior to the date Liberty Mutual ceases to own more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, the parties will take all reasonable action to ensure that any assets, properties, liabilities and obligations related to our business which were not identified as of the date of this offering will be promptly transferred and conveyed to us, and conversely, any assets, properties, liabilities and obligations not related to our business which were not identified as of the date of this offering will be promptly transferred and conveyed to Liberty Mutual. Taxes. Under the Intercompany Agreement, the principles of the tax sharing agreement will also apply for purposes of any tax return in which we or any of our subsidiaries are included in Liberty Mutuals Combined Group. The Intercompany Agreement addresses certain matters with respect to any event or transaction that causes us or one of our subsidiaries to no longer be eligible to join with Liberty Mutual or one or more affiliates of Liberty Mutual in filing tax returns as a Consolidated Group or a Combined Group. Liberty Mutual intends to administer the tax sharing agreement in a manner that is consistent with past practices. Amendment and Termination. The Intercompany Agreement may only be amended by mutual consent of us and Liberty Mutual. The Intercompany Agreement may be terminated by the mutual consent of us and Liberty Mutual and it will automatically terminate upon the later of (i) the first anniversary of the date Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own at least 20% of our outstanding common stock and (ii) the date the Liberty Mutual first beneficially owns less than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Services Agreement We will enter into a Services Agreement with Liberty Mutual, pursuant to which Liberty Mutual will, itself or through its affiliates or third parties, provide services to us for a fee of 1% of the sum of the direct and assumed affiliate written premiums reported on the combined statutory annual statement of our insurance subsidiaries and controlled affiliates. We will also be required to reimburse Liberty Mutual for the reasonable cost of performing the services under the Services Agreement, less costs for human resources, corporate finance and investment management services. Liberty Mutual generally is required to perform the services in a commercially reasonable manner and at a level that is at least equal to its standards for performing such 201 Table of Contents services on behalf of its own insurance operations and in accordance with applicable law. These services include, but are not limited to:  accounting, actuarial, risk management, financial, tax and auditing services,  purchasing, payroll processing, human resources and employee relations and/or benefits services,  marketing and strategic support services,  information technology and support and business continuity services,  policy administration and production services,  real estate management services,  legal, compliance and complex and emerging risks claims services,  reinsurance services;  general administration services; and  other mutually agreed-upon services. The Services Agreement may be terminated without cause by either us or Liberty Mutual, in whole or in part, upon not less than 180 days written notice. The Services Agreement may also be terminated by a party upon the dissolution, insolvency or receivership of the other party or if there is a change in law which would cause the performance of the services provided thereunder to violate applicable law. The Services Agreement or any service provided thereunder, may be terminated, by either us or Liberty Mutual if the other party fails to perform its material obligations under the agreement which continues for 30 days after receipt of notice of such failure from the terminating party. In addition, unless Liberty Mutual otherwise consents to continue providing services, the Services Agreement automatically terminates in the event that Liberty Mutual no longer beneficially owns more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. The Services Agreement generally provides that the parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of disputes arising in connection with the Services Agreement without resorting to arbitration. If these efforts are not successful, the dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Services Agreement, which provides for the selection of a three-arbitrator panel and the conduct of the arbitration hearing. Both we and Liberty Mutual will be permitted to seek a preliminary injunction or other provision judicial remedy, if in our or Liberty Mutuals reasonable judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable harm. Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement In connection with the offering, Liberty Mutual has agreed to permit us to continue writing surety business through its affiliates for an initial term of five years. All surety business written by Liberty Mutual on our behalf will be ceded to us under an amendment and restatement of the Surety Reinsurance Agreement previously discussed, which amendment and restatement we refer to as the Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement. We will enter into the Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement prior to the consummation of this offering, subject to receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals. The Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement is substantially similar to the Surety Reinsurance Agreement in all material respects, except for provisions relating to term, termination and other reinsurance as well as the addition of an informal dispute resolution mechanism substantially similar to that in the Intercompany Agreement. Upon the expiration of the initial five year term, the Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement will continue until terminated. The Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement may be terminated by either Liberty Mutual or us upon at least 365 days written notice, provided that, with respect to Liberty Mutual, if notice is given more than 365 days prior to the expiration of the initial 5 year term, the termination will not be effective until the expiration of the initial 5 year term. Liberty Mutual may also terminate the Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement on 365 days written notice if it ceases to beneficially own shares entitled to more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. The Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement also may be terminated at any 202 Table of Contents time upon the mutual written agreement of Liberty Mutual and us and immediately by the non-breaching party in the event of a material breach that is not cured within 45 days. Additionally, during the term of the Restated Surety Reinsurance Agreement, Liberty Mutual may not obtain any other reinsurance covering the business ceded to us without our consent. Registration Rights Agreement We will enter into a registration rights agreement with Liberty Mutual that provides that Liberty Mutual can demand that we register the distribution of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Liberty Mutual after this offering, so-called demand registration rights. Liberty Mutual may make up to two demands in any calendar year. In addition, Liberty Mutual has so-called piggyback registration rights, which means that Liberty Mutual may include its shares in any future registrations of our common equity securities, whether or not that registration relates to a primary offering by us or a secondary offering by or on behalf of any of our stockholders. These registration rights are transferable by Liberty Mutual. We have agreed to pay all costs and expenses in connection with each such registration, except transfer taxes, underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the shares of common stock sold by Liberty Mutual. The registration rights agreement will contain customary terms and provisions with respect to, among other things, registration procedures and rights to indemnification in connection with the registration of the common stock on behalf of Liberty Mutual. Real Estate License Agreements Our principal office and certain branch offices are owned or leased by Liberty Mutual. We will enter into Real Estate License Agreements with Liberty Mutual that provide us and our subsidiaries the right to use and occupy space in Liberty Mutual owned and leased buildings and we will reimburse Liberty Mutual for the costs associated with that space. Liberty Mutual also will enter into Real Estate License Agreements with us that provide Liberty Mutual the right to use and occupy space in buildings owned or leased by us and will reimburse us for the costs associated with that space. The licenses granted under the Real Estate License Agreements for owned buildings will terminate on the earlier of (i) the sale of the building, (ii) 180 days written notice by the licensor, and (iii) January 1 of any calendar year (but no earlier than January 1, 2014) with 28 months prior written notice by the licensee. The licenses granted under the Real Estate License Agreement for leased buildings will terminate on the expiration of the licensors underlying lease to occupy such space. In addition, the licenses for owned or leased buildings may terminate (i) pursuant to law, (ii) by the licensor upon written notice to the licensee after such time as Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock or (iii) by licensor in the event of a fire, casualty or condemnation. The Real Estate License Agreements generally provide that the parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of disputes arising in connection with the Real Estate License Agreements without resorting to arbitration. If these efforts are not successful, the dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Real Estate License Agreements, which provides for the selection of a three-arbitrator panel and the conduct of the arbitration hearing. Both we and Liberty Mutual will be permitted to seek a preliminary injunction or other provision judicial remedy, if in either partys reasonable judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable harm. Run-Off Indemnification Agreement Prior to the completion of this offering, we will enter into the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement with Liberty Mutual. Pursuant to the agreement, Liberty Mutual will indemnify us, on an incurred basis, against adverse development in our total Run-Off Reserves, which includes any failure to fully realize reinsurance recoverables with respect to our total Run-Off Reserves, whether due to coverage disputes or inability to pay. The Run-Off Indemnification Agreement will provide that, if at any time following this offering and as measured by the quarterly settlement procedures described below, our total Run-Off Reserves develop adversely from the amounts established in our most recent quarterly financial statements available prior to this offering (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationCritical Accounting EstimatesClaims and Claim Adjustment ExpensesClaims and Claim Adjustment 203 Table of Contents Expense ReservesCorporate and Other), Liberty Mutual will pay to us an amount equal to such adverse development, up to an aggregate amount of $500 million. The aggregate amount of indemnification payments which Liberty Mutual will be required to pay will be reduced by any previous payments from Liberty Mutual under the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. We will be required to refund Liberty Mutual any payments under the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement in the event of favorable development in our total Run-Off Reserves but never in an amount in excess of the aggregate indemnification amounts we have previously received from Liberty Mutual. The Run-Off Indemnification Agreement will provide for quarterly settlement procedures by which we and Liberty Mutual intend to settle any amounts due to each other under the agreement. Any disputes that arise under the agreement relating to amounts owed by either us or Liberty Mutual or the establishment of our total Run-Off Reserves will be resolved through arbitration as specifically set forth in the Run-Off Indemnification Agreement. However, if there is such a dispute, Liberty Mutual will pay the amount we determine to be due, subject to refund by us if it is determined that we are not entitled to the amount paid to us. Our total Run-Off Reserves will be established by us in a manner consistent with the methodologies, procedures, judgments and assumptions used by us prior to this offering. Liberty Mutual currently services the Run-Off Reserves that are not serviced by Agency Corporation Dedicated Employees, and we intend to have Liberty Mutual continue to service those Run-Off Reserves following the transfer of such employees to us as of January 1, 2011. The Run-Off Indemnification Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of the time that there are no liabilities for our Run-Off Operations remaining or the second anniversary of the date that the aggregate net payments made by Liberty Mutual under the agreement equal $500 million if the parties agree that no reinsurance refunds are likely to become due. The Run-Off Indemnification Agreement may only be amended or assigned with the written consent of both parties. Trademark License Agreement We will enter into a Trademark License Agreement with Liberty Mutual pursuant to which each party will grant to the other the right to make various uses of certain trademarks and service marks owned by such party. The rights granted to us will include, subject to any applicable regulatory restrictions, the right to use certain marks containing the words Liberty Mutual and the Statue of Liberty design. We will also grant Liberty Mutual the right to use our marks. Each party agrees to use the other partys marks in a manner consistent with the standards of the party owning the marks. The Trademark License Agreement will grant each party the right to sublicense such rights to its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, as well as to other third parties for advertising, promoting and marketing its business. The Trademark License Agreement may be terminated: (i) by either party in the event that Liberty Mutual no longer beneficially owns more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock; (ii) in the event of a material breach not cured within 30 days; (iii) the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the other party; or (iv) by the mutual agreement of the parties. The Trademark License Agreement generally provides that the parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of disputes arising in connection with the Trademark License Agreement without resorting to arbitration. If these efforts are not successful, the dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Trademark License Agreement, which provides for the selection of a three-arbitrator panel and the conduct of the arbitration hearing. Both we and Liberty Mutual will be permitted to seek a preliminary injunction or other provisional judicial remedy if, in either partys reasonable judgment, such action is necessary to avoid irreparable harm. 204 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK In connection with this offering, we will amend and restate our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Copies of the forms of our amended certificate of incorporation and bylaws will be filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. The provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and relevant sections of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, are summarized below. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and is subject to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. For the purpose of the description below of the corporate opportunity and interested director provisions, the terms we, our, us, and Liberty Mutual include subsidiaries and other entities in which we or they respectively own 50% or more of the voting power or similar interests and, in the case of Liberty Mutual, all successors by way of merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Our authorized capital stock consists of shares of Class A common stock, par value $ per share, shares of Class B common stock, par value $ per share, and shares of preferred stock, par value $ per share. Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock Voting Rights Generally on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Generally both classes vote together as a single class on all matters. The holders of Class B common stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect 80% of the total number of directors on our board of directors which we would have if there were no vacancies on our board of directors at the time, and as otherwise required by law, although each share of Class B common stock will automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock if Liberty Mutual beneficially owns less than 20% of the shares of our outstanding common stock, provided that, as of such date, Liberty Mutual has not made any distribution intended to qualify as a tax-free spin-off. The only exceptions to these voting rights are that the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock, voting as a single class, are each entitled to one vote per share in the election of directors not entitled to be elected solely by the holders of the Class B Stock, and the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock, voting as a single class, are each entitled to one vote per share if, following a distribution of Class B common stock to stockholders or creditors of Liberty Mutual in a transaction, including any distribution in exchange for Liberty Mutuals shares or securities, intended to qualify as a tax-free spin-off, we submit to our stockholders a proposal to convert all outstanding shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock. Other than with respect to the number of votes per share, the election of directors, conversion, certain actions that require the consent of holders of Class B common stock as set forth in this prospectus and other than as required by law, the rights of the holders of the Class A common stock are identical to those of the Class B common stock. After the completion of this offering, Liberty Mutual will beneficially own all of our outstanding Class B common stock and no shares of our Class A common stock, representing % of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and % of our total equity ownership, assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised. Therefore, Liberty Mutual will have the power to elect all of the members of our board of directors that are elected by stockholders and will have the power to control all matters requiring stockholder approval or consent. Dividend Rights Subject to the rights of holders of any then outstanding preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends ratably, as may be declared by our board of directors on the common stock out of funds legally available for the payment of those dividends. However, dividends payable in shares of our 205 Table of Contents common stock will be paid to holders of Class A common stock in Class A common stock and to holders of Class B common stock in Class B common stock. Other Rights Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive their ratable share of the net assets of our company available after payment of all debts and other liabilities, subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription or redemption rights. Pursuant to the Intercompany Agreement, Liberty Mutual is entitled to certain equity purchase rights, as described in Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Intercompany Agreement. The outstanding shares of common stock are, and the shares of Class A common stock offered by us in this offering will be, when issued and paid for, fully paid and non-assessable. Conversion Rights Shares of our Class A common stock are not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible while held directly or indirectly by Liberty Mutual at the option of Liberty Mutual into one share of Class A common stock. If our Class B common stock is distributed to stock or security holders of Liberty Mutual in a transaction (including any distribution in exchange for shares of Liberty Mutual or its successors common stock or other securities) intended to qualify as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Code, or any corresponding provision of any successor statute, shares of our Class B common stock will no longer be convertible into shares of Class A common stock. Prior to any such distribution, each share of Class B common stock will automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock upon the transfer of such shares of Class B common stock by Liberty Mutual other than to any of Liberty Mutuals successors or any of its subsidiaries (excluding us). Also prior to any such distribution, each share of Class B common stock will also automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock if Liberty Mutual beneficially owns less than 20% of shares of our outstanding common stock, voting together as a single class. Following any such distribution, we may submit to our stockholders a proposal to convert all outstanding shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock, provided that we have received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service satisfactory to Liberty Mutual to the effect that the conversion will not affect the intended tax treatment of the distribution. In a meeting of our stockholders called for this purpose, the holders of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock will be entitled to one vote per share and, subject to applicable law, will vote together as a single class and neither class of common stock will be entitled to a separate class vote. All conversions will be effected on a share-for-share basis. Preferred Stock Our board of directors has the authority, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the preferences, limitations and rights of the shares of each series, including:  the designation of each series;  the number of shares of each series;  the rate of dividends, if any;  whether dividends, if any, shall be cumulative or noncumulative;  the terms of redemption and sinking fund, if any;  the rights of the series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or  winding-up of the affairs of our company;  rights and terms of conversion or exchange, if any; 206 Table of Contents  restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same series or any other series, if any; and  voting rights, if any. Antitakeover Effects of Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the Intercompany Agreement Rights of our stockholders and related matters are governed by the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and the Intercompany Agreement, certain provisions of which may discourage or make more difficult a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest by means of a tender offer or proxy content or removal of our incumbent officers or directors. These provisions may also adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock. However, we believe that the benefits of increased protection give us the potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us and outweigh the disadvantage of discouraging those proposals because negotiation of the proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. Board of Directors Our board of directors will consist of not less than five and not more then fifteen directors, with the exact number to be determined by the board of directors. The holders of Class B common stock, voting separately as a class, will be entitled to elect 80% of our board of directors, which we refer to as Class B Designees. The remaining directors, which we refer to as Joint Designees, will be elected by the holders of the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock, voting together as a single class, with the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock each entitled to one vote per share of common stock. The initial division of our board of directors into Class B Designees and Joint Designees will be made prior to this offering by the vote of the majority of the entire board of directors so that the Class B Designees will constitute at least 80% of our board of directors upon the completion of this offering. If Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own shares of Class B common stock representing at least 20% of our outstanding common stock and has not made any distribution intended to qualify as a tax-free spin-off, all shares of Class B common stock will convert to shares of Class A common stock. At that point, all of the members of our board of directors will be Joint Designees and thereafter be elected by the holders of Class A common stock. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that our board of directors will be further classified into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Accordingly, at least one-third of our board of directors will be elected at each annual meeting. Unless we issue preferred stock that has rights to elect directors, each class will consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors and one-third of the respective Class B Designees (for so long as there are Class B Designees) and Joint Designees. No director may be a member of more than one class of directors. The initial division of our board of directors into classes will be made by a vote of a majority of the entire board of directors. Any Class B Designee on our board of directors may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of 80% of the holders of Class B common stock, voting separately as a class. Any Joint Designee on our board of directors may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of, Joint Designees. Any vacancy on our board of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled only by a majority of our board of directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring in our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. However, until Liberty Mutual ceases to be the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Class A common stock and the holders of Class B common stock, voting together as a single class, any vacancy caused by the removal of a director by our stockholders may be filled only by our stockholders pursuant to the procedures for electing Class B Designees or Joint Designees, as appropriate. 207 Table of Contents Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for so long as there is Class B common stock outstanding, if the appointment of any person to a vacancy would cause the number of Class B Designees on our board of directors to be less than 80% of the total number of directors on our board of directors which we would have if there were no vacancies on our board of directors at the time, then the vacancy will be filled by majority vote of the Class B Designees then in office, and the director filling the vacancy will be designated a Class B Designee. After the completion of this offering, Liberty Mutual will beneficially own all of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing % of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and % of our total equity ownership, assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised. Therefore, Liberty Mutual will have the power to elect all of the members of our board of directors that are elected by stockholders and will have the power to control all matters requiring stockholder approval or consent. Cumulative Voting Our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights. Stockholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings Our certificate of incorporation provides that until such time as Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own shares representing at least a majority of votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Class A common stock and the holders of Class B common stock, voting together as a single class, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, so long as written consent is obtained from the holders of the minimum number of votes that would have been required to authorize or take action if such a meeting were held. From and after such time as Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own shares representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Class A common stock and the holders of Class B common stock, voting together as a single class, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders may be effected only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by a written consent or consents by stockholders in lieu of such a meeting. Except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of our stockholders for any purpose or purposes may only be called by (i) Liberty Mutual, so long as Liberty Mutual is the beneficial owner of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Class A common stock and the holders of Class B common stock, voting together as a single class, (ii) our chairman or (iii) our board of directors or our secretary pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of directors then in office. No business other than that stated in the notice of a special meeting may be transacted at such special meetings. Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals Related to Director Nominations or Other Business Our bylaws will contain advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals related to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting. These procedures will provide that notice, in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, of proposals related to stockholder nominations for the election of directors or other business brought before the meeting must be received by our secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or after that anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be received not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever occurs first. The procedure for stockholder nominations for the 2011 annual meeting will be governed by this proviso, provided that the anniversary date shall be deemed to be , 2011. Stockholder nominations for the election of directors at a special meeting at which directors are elected must be received by our secretary no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such 208 Table of Contents special meeting and no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever occurs first.

Amendment Subject to the rights of holders of our Class B common stock to withhold their consent to the amendment of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to corporate opportunities and conflicts of interest between our company and Liberty Mutual, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, including those relating to corporate opportunities and conflicts of interest between us and Liberty Mutual, the consent of Liberty Mutual or its successor-in-interest as the holder of our Class B common stock, our bylaws, our board of directors, the indemnification of our directors and officers and regulatory status, may be amended by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast thereon. All other provisions of our certificate of incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast thereon. Our board of directors may from time to time make, amend, supplement or repeal our bylaws upon the vote of a majority of our board of directors. Once Liberty Mutual or its successor-in-interest ceases to own shares representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Class A common stock and the holders of Class B common stock, voting together as a single class, our certificate of incorporation provides that the sections of our bylaws related to our stockholder annual and special meetings, including notice of meetings, quorum and adjournment, conduct of business, notice of stockholder business or nominations, required vote and actions by written consent; sections related to our board of directors, including powers, number, tenure and election of directors; special meetings of and vacancies on our board of directors; meeting quorum and director approval and sections related to indemnification, insurance and the amendment of our bylaws may only be amended by the affirmative vote of shares representing at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding common stock, voting as a single class, subject to any voting rights granted to any holders of any preferred stock. Insurance Regulations Concerning Change of Control Many state insurance regulatory laws intended primarily for the protection of policyholders contain provisions that require advance approval by state agencies of any change in control of an insurance company or insurance holding company that is domiciled or, in some cases having such substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that state. For additional information relating to these requirements, see Regulation. Delaware Anti-Takeover Law Our certificate of incorporation will contain a provision by which we will expressly elect not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prevents a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the time that that person became an interested stockholder unless:  prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;  upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding specified shares);  on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is; (i) approved by the board of directors of the corporation; and (ii) authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2 / 3 % of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. In this context, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, 210 Table of Contents together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status owned, 15% or more of a corporations outstanding voting stock. Certificate of Incorporation Provisions Relating to Corporate Opportunities and Interested Directors In order to address potential conflicts of interest between us and Liberty Mutual, our certificate of incorporation will contain provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs as they may involve Liberty Mutual and its officers and directors, and our powers, rights, duties and liabilities and those of our officers, directors and stockholders in connection with our relationship with Liberty Mutual. In general, these provisions recognize that we and Liberty Mutual may engage in the same or similar business activities and product lines, have an interest in the same areas of corporate opportunities, and will continue to have contractual and business relations with each other, including service of officers and directors of Liberty Mutual serving as our directors. Our certificate of incorporation will provide that, subject to any contractual provision to the contrary, Liberty Mutual will have no duty to refrain from:  engaging in the same or similar business activities or product lines as us,  doing business with any of our clients or customers, or  employing or otherwise engaging any of our officers or employees. Under our certificate of incorporation, neither Liberty Mutual nor any officer or director of Liberty Mutual, except as described in the following paragraph, will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any such activities. Our certificate of incorporation will provide that Liberty Mutual is not under any duty to present any corporate opportunity to us which may be a corporate opportunity for Liberty Mutual and us and Liberty Mutual will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as our stockholder by reason of the fact that Liberty Mutual pursues or acquires that corporate opportunity for itself, directs that corporate opportunity to another person, or does not present that corporate opportunity to us. When one of our directors or officers who is also a director or officer of Liberty Mutual learns of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both us and Liberty Mutual, the certificate of incorporation will provide that the director or officer:  will have fully satisfied his or her fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders with respect to that corporate opportunity,  will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty by reason of Liberty Mutuals actions with respect to that corporate opportunity,  will be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he or she believed to be in, and not opposed to, our best interests for purposes of our certificate of incorporation, and  will be deemed not to have breached his or her duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders and not to have derived an improper personal benefit therefrom for purposes of our certificate of incorporation, if he or she acts in good faith in a manner consistent with the following policy:  we may not pursue a corporate opportunity offered to any of our officers or directors who is also a director or an officer of Liberty Mutual, unless that opportunity is expressly offered to that person solely in his or her capacity as our officer or director, in which case we may pursue it. For purposes of the certificate of incorporation, corporate opportunities will only include business opportunities that we are financially able to undertake, that are, from their nature, in our line of business, are of practical advantage to us and are ones in which we have an interest or a reasonable expectancy, and in which, by embracing the opportunities, the self-interest of Liberty Mutual or its officers or directors will be brought into conflict with our self-interest. 211 Table of Contents The certificate of incorporation will also provide that no contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction between us and Liberty Mutual will be void or voidable solely for the reason that Liberty Mutual is a party to such agreement and Liberty Mutual:  will have fully satisfied and fulfilled its fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders with respect to the contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction,  will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty by reason of entering into, performance or consummation of any such contract, agreement, arrangements or transactions,  will be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner it reasonably believed to be in, and not opposed to, the best interests of us for purposes of the certificate of incorporation, and  will be deemed not to have breached its duties of loyalty to us and our stockholders and not to have derived an improper personal benefit therefrom for purposes of the certificate of incorporation, if:  the material facts as to the contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction are disclosed or are known to our board of directors or the committee of our board of directors that authorizes the contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction and our board of directors or that committee in good faith authorizes the contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors; or  the transaction, judged according to the circumstances at the time of the commitment, is established to have been fair to us. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have consented to these provisions of the certificate of incorporation. The corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation will continue in effect until the later of (i) Liberty Mutual ceasing to beneficially own shares representing at least 20% our outstanding common stock and (ii) the date upon which none of our officers or directors is also an officer or director of Liberty Mutual. The vote of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast will be required to amend, alter, change or repeal the corporate opportunity provisions. Accordingly, until such time, so long as Liberty Mutual beneficially owns at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, it can prevent any such alteration, adoption, amendment or repeal. Approval Rights of Holders of Class B Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation and the Intercompany Agreement will provide that until Liberty Mutual ceases to beneficially own at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, the prior consent of the holders of a majority of the Class B common stock then outstanding, will be required (subject in each case to certain exceptions) for:  the adoption or implementation of any stockholder rights plan;  any consolidation or merger of us with any person (other than any of our subsidiaries), or entry into any other transaction or series of transactions that would otherwise result in a change of control;  any acquisition by us or any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition, other than transactions between us and our subsidiaries, or any series of related acquisitions or dispositions, involving consideration in excess of $25 million;  the issuance by us or one of our subsidiaries of any stock or stock equivalents;  the incurrence, issuance, assumption, guarantee or otherwise becoming liable for any debt, other than debt in an amount not to exceed $200 million in connection with the revolving credit facility that we intend to enter into; 212 Table of Contents  our dissolution, liquidation or winding up;  the election, designation, appointment or removal of any executive officer of Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation;  the declaration of dividends on any class or series of our capital stock other than preferred stock;  any change in our authorized capital stock or our creation of any class or series of capital stock;  any change in the number of directors on our board of directors, or filling any newly created seats or vacancies on our board of directors; or  the amendment of various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast is required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with the control provisions described above. Provisions Relating to Regulatory Status The certificate of incorporation and the Intercompany Agreement will also contain provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs as they may affect Liberty Mutual and its legal and regulatory status. In general, the certificate of incorporation will provide that, without the written consent of Liberty Mutual, which will not be unreasonably withheld, we will not take any action or fail to take any action that would result in:  Liberty Mutuals being required to obtain any approval, consent or the authorization of, or otherwise become subject to any rules, regulations or other legal restrictions of any governmental, administrative or regulatory authority, or  any of our directors who is also a director or officer of Liberty Mutual being ineligible to serve or prohibited from serving as a director of Liberty Mutual under applicable law. The certificate of incorporation will further provide that Liberty Mutual will not be liable to us or our stockholders by reason of the fact that Liberty Mutual gives or withholds any such consent for any reason. Any persons purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have consented to these provisions of the certificate of incorporation. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast will be required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, the provision of the certificate of incorporation described above; however, the provision relating to legal and regulatory status automatically becomes inoperative on the later of the date Liberty Mutual first ceases to beneficially own at least 20% of our then outstanding common stock and the date upon which no officer or director of Liberty Mutual is an officer or director of our company. Accordingly, until such time, so long as Liberty Mutual beneficially owns at least 20% of our outstanding common stock, it can prevent any alteration, adoption, amendment or repeal of that provision. The Delaware courts have not conclusively determined the validity or enforceability of provisions similar to the corporate opportunity, interested director and legal and regulatory status provisions that are included in our certificate of incorporation and could rule that some liabilities which those provisions purport to eliminate remain in effect. Limitation of Liability of Directors Our certificate of incorporation will provide that none of our directors shall be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent otherwise required by the DGCL. The effect of this provision is to eliminate our rights, and our stockholders rights, to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. This provision does not limit or eliminate our right, or the right of any stockholder, to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a directors duty of care. In addition, our certificate of incorporation will provide that if the DGCL is amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of a director, then the liability of the directors shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent 213 Table of Contents permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. These provisions will not alter the liability of directors under federal or state securities laws. Our certificate of incorporation will also include provisions for the indemnification of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Further, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with certain of our directors and officers which require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities which may arise by reason of the directors status or service as a director, other than liabilities arising from bad faith or willful misconduct of a culpable nature. We also intend to maintain director and officer liability insurance, if available on reasonable terms. Transfer Agent and Registrar will serve as transfer agent and branch registrar for our Class A common stock in the United States. 214 Table of Contents SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock. Although we expect to have our Class A common stock approved for listing on the NYSE, we cannot assure you that there will be an active public market for our Class A common stock. Sales in the future of substantial amounts of our common stock by Liberty Mutual, or the perception of these sales, may adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future. Upon the completion of this offering, we will have shares of Class A common stock outstanding and shares of Class B common stock outstanding. Of the outstanding number of Class A common stock, Class A common stock to be sold in the offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933. In addition: shares of Class A common stock are reserved for issuance upon conversion of Class B common stock; and shares of Class A common stock are reserved for issuance under our director, officer and employee benefit plans. We and Liberty Mutual have agreed, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the underwriters, not to, during the period ending 180 days after the date of this prospectus, sell or otherwise dispose of Class A common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Class A common stock, except under limited circumstances described under Underwriting. To the extent not otherwise freely tradable or able to be sold under an exemption contained in Rule 144, we currently expect that we will file a registration statement with the SEC in order to register the offer of our Class A common stock issued pursuant to our director, officer and employee benefit plans. We also have agreed to file registration statements with the SEC in order to register the reoffer and resale of our common stock held by Liberty Mutual and its subsidiaries as described under Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  Agreements with Liberty Mutual Related to this Offering  Registration Rights Agreement. In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person or persons whose shares are aggregated together, including an affiliate, who has beneficially owned restricted shares for at least six months is entitled to sell, within any three-month period, a number of these shares that does not exceed the greater of:  one percent of the then outstanding Class A common stock or  the average weekly trading volume in Class A common stock on the NYSE during the four calendar weeks preceding the date on which notice of this sale is filed, so long as requirements concerning availability of public information, manner of sale and notice of sale are satisfied. In addition, affiliates must comply with the restrictions and requirements of Rule 144, other than the six-month holding period requirement, in order to sell Class A common stock that are not restricted securities within the meaning of that rule. Under Rule 144(k), a person who is not an affiliate and has not been an affiliate for at least three months prior to the sale and who has beneficially owned restricted shares for at least one year may resell these shares without compliance with the foregoing requirements. 215 Table of Contents CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS The following is a general discussion of the anticipated material U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences relating to the ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock by non-United States holders, as defined below, who purchase our Class A common stock in this offering and hold such Class A common stock as capital assets. This discussion is based on currently existing provisions of the Code, existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretation thereof, all as in effect or proposed on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect or different interpretations. This discussion does not address all the tax consequences that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income or estate tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, retirement plans, partnerships and their partners, other pass-through entities and their members, dealers in securities, brokers, U.S. expatriates, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar or persons who have acquired our Class A common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction, synthetic security or other integrated investment). This discussion does not address the U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax consequences relating to the ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock. YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS. As used in this discussion, the term non-United States holder refers to a beneficial owner of our Class A common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state therein, including the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of source thereof; or (iv) a trust (a) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all its substantial decisions, or (b) that has in effect a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to the treated as a United States person. An individual may, in many cases, be treated as a resident of the United States in any calendar year for U.S. federal income tax purposes, rather than a nonresident, by, among other ways, being present in the United States on at least 31 days in that calendar year and for an aggregate of at least 183 days during the three-year period ending in that calendar year (counting for such purposes all the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year) unless certain conditions are met. Residents of the United States are subject to U.S. federal income tax as if they were U.S. citizens. If a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Class A common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding Class A common stock, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor. Dividends We or a withholding agent will have to withhold U.S. federal withholding tax from the gross amount of any dividends paid to a non-United States holder at a rate of 30%, unless (i) an applicable income tax treaty reduces or eliminates such tax, and a non-United States holder claiming the benefit of such treaty provides to 216 Table of Contents us or such agent proper Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, documentation or (ii) the dividends are effectively connected with a non-United States holders conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or where a treaty provides the dividends are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such non-United States holder, and the non-United States holder provides to us or such agent proper IRS documentation. In the latter case, such non-United States holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends in the same manner as a U.S. citizen or corporation, as applicable, unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty. Additionally, a non-United States holder that is a corporation could be subject to a branch profits tax on effectively connected dividend income at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty). If a non-United States holder is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty, such non-United States holder may obtain a refund of any excess amount withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition Generally, a non-United States holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our Class A common stock unless (i) such non-United States holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange or other disposition and certain other conditions are met, (ii) the gain is effectively connected with such non-United States holders conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or where a tax treaty provides, the gain is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such non-United States holder, or (iii) we are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding such sale, exchange or other disposition or the period that such non-United States holder held our Class A common stock. We do not believe that we have been, are currently or are likely to be a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we were to become a U.S. real property holding corporation, so long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market and continues to be traded, a non-United States holder would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of Class A common stock only if such non-United States holder actually or constructively owned more than 5% of our Class A common stock during the shorter of the five-year period preceding such sale, exchange or other disposition or the period that such non-United States holder held our Class A common stock. Special rules may apply to non-United States holders, such as controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid federal income tax, that are subject to special treatment under the Code. These entities should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to them. Federal Estate Tax Common stock owned or treated as owned by an individual who is a non-United States holder at the time of his or her death generally will be included in the individuals gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes and may be subject to U.S. federal estate tax unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax Information reporting may apply to payments made to a non-United States holder on or with respect to our Class A common stock. Backup withholding tax (at the then applicable rate) may also apply to payments made to a non-United States holder on or with respect to our Class A common stock, unless the non-United States holder certifies as to its status as a non-United States holder under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption, and certain other conditions are satisfied. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-United States holder will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such non-United States holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 217 Table of Contents Recent Legislation Relating to Foreign Accounts Legislation was recently enacted into law that will materially change the requirements for obtaining an exemption from U.S. withholding tax and impose withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to foreign financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. In general, and depending on the specific facts and circumstances, the failure to comply with the additional certification, information reporting and other specified requirements will result in a 30 percent withholding tax being imposed on withholdable payments, including payments of dividends and proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock, to certain non-United States holders. These rules will apply to payments made after December 31, 2012 with respect to our Class A common stock. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding this legislation and the potential implications of this legislation on their investment in our common stock. 218 Table of Contents UNDERWRITING Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are acting as joint book-running managers of the offering and as representatives of the underwriters named below. Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus, each underwriter named below has severally agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to that underwriter, the number of shares set forth opposite the underwriters name. Number Underwriter of Shares Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated Total The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the shares included in this offering are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to purchase all the shares (other than those covered by the over-allotment option described below) if they purchase any of the shares. Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount from the initial public offering price not to exceed $ per share. If all the shares are not sold at the initial offering price, the underwriters may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The representatives have advised us that the underwriters do not intend to make sales to discretionary accounts. If the underwriters sell more shares than the total number set forth in the table above, we have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to additional shares at the public offering price less the underwriting discount. The underwriters may exercise the option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, in connection with this offering. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter must purchase a number of additional shares approximately proportionate to that underwriters initial purchase commitment. Any shares issued or sold under the option will be issued and sold on the same terms and conditions as the other shares that are the subject of this offering. We, our officers and directors, certain of our employees and Liberty Mutual have agreed that, for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of the representatives, dispose of or hedge any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Class A common stock. The representatives in their sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) during the last 17 days of the 180-day restricted period, we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to our company occurs; or (ii) prior to the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 180-day restricted period, the restrictions described above shall continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our shares. Consequently, the initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the representatives. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were our results of operations, our current financial condition, our future prospects, our markets, the economic conditions in and future prospects for the industry in which we compete, our management, and currently prevailing general conditions in the equity securities markets, including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company. We cannot assure you, however, that the price at which the shares will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active trading market in our shares will develop and continue after this offering. 219 Table of Contents We intend to apply to have our Class A common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LMA. The following table shows the underwriting discounts and commissions that we are to pay to the underwriters in connection with this offering. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. Paid by us No Exercise Full Exercise Per share $ $ Total $ $ In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions, which may include purchases pursuant to the over-allotment option, and stabilizing purchases.  Short sales involve secondary market sales by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering.  Covered short sales are sales of shares in an amount up to the number of shares represented by the underwriters over-allotment option.  Naked short sales are sales of shares in an amount in excess of the number of shares represented by the underwriters over-allotment option.  Covering transactions involve purchases of shares either pursuant to the over-allotment option or in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions.  To close a naked short position, the underwriters must purchase shares in the open market after the distribution has been completed. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.  To close a covered short position, the underwriters must purchase shares in the open market after the distribution has been completed or must exercise the over-allotment option. In determining the source of shares to close the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option.  Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase shares so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the shares. They may also cause the price of the shares to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The underwriters may conduct these transactions on the New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedules included in pages S-1 through S-7. These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts , 2010 The foregoing report is in the form that will be signed upon the completion of the formation transaction to transfer Ohio Casualty and its subsidiaries to the Company as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts May 10, 2010 F-2 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Consolidated Statements of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Revenues Net premiums earned $ 9,983 $ 6,913 $ 4,325 Net investment income 910 719 405 Fee and other revenues 97 50 33 Net realized investment losses (53 ) (407 ) (5 ) Total revenues 10,937 7,275 4,758 Claims and expenses Claims and claim adjustment expenses 6,157 4,326 2,601 General and administrative expenses 1,005 777 551 Goodwill impairment  973  Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 2,392 1,664 1,056 Interest expense 4 21 6 Total claims and expenses 9,558 7,761 4,214 Income (loss) before income tax expense 1,379 (486 ) 544 Income tax expense 377 78 167 Net income (loss) $ 1,002 $ (564 ) $ 377 Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net realized investment gains (losses) Net realized investment gains (losses), excluding other-than-temporary impairment losses $ 49 $ (198 ) $ (2 ) Other-than-temporary impairment losses: Total other-than-temporary impairment losses (107 ) (209 ) (3 ) Portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income 5   Net impairment losses recognized in earnings (102 ) (209 ) (3 ) Net realized investment losses, including other-than-temporary impairment losses $ (53 ) $ (407 ) $ (5 ) See accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements.

F-6 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in millions except per share amounts) (1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation and its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates (collectively the Company or LMAC). The Company is a carve-out of Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc., a non-public mutual holding company (collectively, with all non-LMAC affiliates, Liberty Mutual). The Companys subsidiaries and controlled affiliates are comprised of thirty-eight insurance companies. Certain controlled affiliates are consolidated into the Companys results. See Note 3  Investments  Variable Interest Entities for additional detail. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company is anticipating an initial public offering of common stock pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the Offering). Prior to the completion of the Offering, Liberty Mutual will cause Ohio Casualty Corporation and its subsidiaries (Ohio Casualty) to be transferred to the Company in exchange for a promissory note. At the time of the transfer, the Company will recognize the liability and reflect the consideration in the accompanying statement of changes in stockholders equity as a dividend to Liberty Mutual. The results of Ohio Casualty have been included in the historical results of the Company for all periods presented. In addition, prior to completing the offering, the Company will cause to be transferred Summit Holdings Southeast, Inc. and its insurance subsidiaries, which is referred to as Summit, to Liberty Mutual. The results of Summit and the related intercompany reinsurance agreements have been excluded from the historical results of the Company for all periods presented. However, the Company received $1,026 of cash and investments from Liberty Mutual in 2008 related to the reinsurance agreements. This amount has been recorded as a deposit and is included in net payable to affiliates. As of January 1, 2010, the Company terminated the related reinsurance agreements and will return $1,007 in cash and investments to Liberty Mutual related to the deposit. See Note 16  Subsequent Events for additional detail. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Companys principal estimates include: (1) unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, including asbestos and environmental reserves and associated reinsurance recoverables, and insurance policies with variable premiums; (2) allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and policyholder receivables; (3) fair value determination and other-than-temporary impairments of the investment portfolio; (4) deferred policy acquisition costs; and (5) the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets. While amounts included in the consolidated financial statements reflect managements best estimates and assumptions, these amounts ultimately could be materially different from the amounts currently provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Nature of Operations The Company provides a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-size businesses and individuals through independent agencies throughout the United States. The Company conducts its business through three operating segments and a corporate segment. The Companys Commercial operating segment, with $5,098 of revenues in 2009, offers insurance coverage for commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation, general liability and other commercial risks to small and mid-size businesses. F-7 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) The Companys Personal operating segment, with $4,766 of revenues in 2009, uses the Safeco Insurance brand to offer insurance coverage for private passenger automobile, homeowners and other personal property and liability risks to individuals. The Companys Surety operating segment, with $801 of revenues in 2009, offers contract and commercial surety bonds to businesses and individuals in all states using the Liberty Mutual Surety and Liberty SuretyFirst brands. The Companys Corporate and Other segment reflects the results of external reinsurance, inter-segment reinsurance arrangements, run-off operations, net realized investment gains (losses), unallocated net investment income, and interest and other expenses. See Note 13  Segment Information for additional detail. Adoption of New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new guidance for accounting for other-than-temporary impairments, as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 320, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities . This guidance amends the accounting for other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities, requires the establishment of a policy for determining when credit losses exist, and provides direction on determining the amount of impairment to be recognized in the statements of operations. The adoption of the new guidance resulted in an increase of $3 (net of tax) to retained earnings and a corresponding decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in 2009. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the guidance related to uncertainty in income taxes as codified in ASC 740, Income Taxes . The guidance requires companies to recognize the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is the amount that represents the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being ultimately realized. A liability is recognized for any benefit claimed, or expected to be claimed, in a tax return in excess of the benefit recorded in the financial statements, along with any interest and penalty (if applicable) on the excess. As of the date of adoption, there was no impact to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, and no impact to the related to tax positions that would impact the annual effective rate. Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance on the accounting for variable interests. The revised guidance, as codified in ASC 810, Consolidations, reflects the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation of the previous guidance for determining which company, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. The revised guidance requires an analysis of whether a company has (1) the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses that could potentially be significant to the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. An entity is required to be re-evaluated as a variable interest entity when the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. Additional disclosures are required about a companys involvement in variable interest entities and an ongoing assessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary. Additionally, in February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-10, Amendments for Certain Investment Funds, which defers the revised consolidation requirements for a reporting entitys interest in an entity (1) that has all the attributes of an investment company or (2) for which it is industry practice to apply measurement principles for financial reporting purposes that are consistent with those followed by investment F-8 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) companies and amends the previous provisions for assessing whether fees paid to a legal entitys decision maker or service provider are variable interests. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2010, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company. Investments Fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are debt securities that have principal payment schedules, are held for indefinite periods of time, and are used as a part of the Companys asset/liability strategy or sold in response to risk/reward characteristics, liquidity needs or similar economic factors. These securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair values, net of deferred income taxes, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Equity securities classified as available for sale include common stocks and non-redeemable preferred stocks and are reported at quoted fair values. Changes in the fair values of these securities, net of deferred income taxes, are reflected as unrealized investment gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized investment gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized in income using the specific identification method. Unrealized losses that are other-than-temporary are recognized as realized investment losses. The Company reviews fixed maturity, public equity securities and private equity securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. Securities are reviewed for both quantitative and qualitative considerations including, but not limited to: (a) the extent of the decline in fair value below book value, (b) the duration of the decline, (c) significant adverse changes in the financial condition or near term prospects for the investment or issuer, (d) significant changes in the business climate or credit ratings of the issuer, (e) general market conditions and volatility, (f) industry factors, and (g) the past impairment history of the security holding or the issuer. Effective January 1, 2009 for fixed maturity securities that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company separates impairments into credit loss and non-credit loss components. The determination of the credit loss component of the impairment charge is based on managements best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security compared to its amortized cost, and is reported as part of net realized investment losses. The non-credit component, the residual difference between the credit impairment component and the fair value, is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The factors considered in making an evaluation of credit versus non-credit other-than-temporary impairment include the following: (a) failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments (including the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood the issuer will be able to make payments that increase in the future), (b) performance indicators of the underlying assets in the security (including default and delinquency rates), (c) vintage, (d) geographic concentration, and (e) industry analyst reports, sector credit ratings, and volatility of the securitys fair value. For equity and fixed maturity securities the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment (the amount by which amortized cost exceeds fair value) is included in net realized investment losses. Prior to January 1, 2009 for fixed maturity securities determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, including securities expected to be sold prior to a full recovery in value, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized in operations as the difference between amortized cost and fair value. Upon recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment loss, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized in net realized investment losses. The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for F-9 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) fixed maturity securities the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment. All mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities are reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment treatment in accordance with the guidance of ASC 320, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities and ASC 325, Investments  Other . For mortgage-backed fixed maturity securities, the Company recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments over the economic life of the security. The mortgage-backed fixed maturity portfolio is accounted for under the retrospective method and prepayment assumptions are based on market expectations. When actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments and any resulting adjustment is included in net investment income. Short-term investments are debt securities with maturities at acquisition between three months and one year, are considered available for sale and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. All variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary are consolidated into the Companys financial statements. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their equity value with the change in equity included in net investment income. Recognition of limited partnership and other alternative investment income is delayed due to the availability of the related financial statements, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month delay. Equity investments in privately held businesses are carried at fair value, which approximates cost where market value data is unavailable for the underlying investment. Mortgage loans are stated at amortized cost less a valuation allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible into known amounts of cash and so near to maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value due to changing interest rates. The Companys cash equivalents include debt securities purchased with maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Securities Lending The Company participates in a securities lending program to generate additional income, whereby certain domestic fixed maturity securities are loaned for a short period of time from the Companys portfolio to qualifying third parties via a lending agent. Terms of the agreement are for borrowers of these securities to provide collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. Acceptable collateral may be in the form of cash or permitted securities as outlined in the securities lending agreement. The fair value of the loaned securities is monitored and additional collateral is obtained if the fair value of the collateral falls below 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. Under the terms of the securities lending program, the lending agent indemnifies the Company against borrower defaults. The loaned securities remain a recorded asset in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets; however, the Company records a liability in other liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheets for the amount of cash collateral held, representing its obligation to return the collateral related to the loaned securities. F-10 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually (performed in the third quarter) using a two-step process. The first step is performed to identify potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If necessary, the second step is performed for the purpose of measuring the amount of impairment, if any. Impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount is not recoverable from the discounted cash flows using a market rate and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the operating unit level. The Companys reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are the same as the Companys operating segments. Other intangible assets deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with no residual value. The carrying amount of other intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment in value. If an indicator of impairment exists, a discounted cash flow model is used and impairment is recognized only if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated fair value of the asset. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Acquired In-Force Policy Intangibles Policy acquisition costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new insurance policies are deferred and amortized over the respective policy terms. Deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions, underwriting expenses and premium taxes and are amortized in proportion to earned premiums. Deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed quarterly for recoverability and investment income is considered in the recoverability assessment. All other acquisition expenses are expensed as they are incurred. As a result of the Companys acquisitions of Safeco Corporation and its subsidiaries (Safeco) and Ohio Casualty in 2008 and 2007, respectively, the Company recognized intangible assets equal to the fair value of the acquired in-force policies. Amortization of these assets occurred over the remaining respective policy terms and were fully amortized as of December 31, 2009. Real Estate and Fixed Assets The cost of buildings, furniture, and equipment are depreciated, principally on a straight-line basis, over their estimated useful lives (a maximum of 39.5 years for buildings, 10 years for furniture, and 3-5 years for equipment) and is included within other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Internally developed software is capitalized over its useful life, which is not to exceed 5 years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred while expenditures for improvements are capitalized and depreciated. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease including any rent holiday periods. Landlord incentives are deferred as liabilities and amortized over the lease term. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $127 and $122 of property, land and improvements, respectively. Accumulated depreciation expense related to property, land and improvements as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $18 and $14, respectively. Depreciation expense related to property, land and improvement for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $4, $2 and $1, respectively. The Company has fixed assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $151 and $210, respectively. Accumulated depreciation for the Companys fixed assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $318 and $321, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company had depreciation expense related to fixed assets of $59, $28 and $20, respectively. Included in the fixed asset amounts is $43 and $44 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of internally developed software with accumulated depreciation of $158 and $119 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. F-11 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Depreciation expense for internally developed software for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $20, $21 and $16, respectively. Real Estate Held for Sale In 2009, the Company commenced marketing a data center facility for sale after determining that other properties owned by the Company and its affiliates provide sufficient capacity. The facility has a carrying value of $8 and remains on the market and is included within other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses The Company establishes reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses covering events that occurred in 2009 and prior years. These reserves reflect managements best estimate of the ultimate cost of claims that have been reported but not yet paid and the cost of claims not yet reported, as well as the estimated expenses necessary to settle the claims. Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense estimates are based on past loss experience modified for current claim trends, as well as prevailing social, economic and legal conditions. Final claim payments, however, may ultimately differ from the established reserves, since these payments might not occur for several years. Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense estimates are periodically reviewed and updated, and any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operating results. The Company does not discount reserves other than discounting on the long-term indemnity portion of certain workers compensation claims. In establishing unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we also take into consideration estimated amounts of, salvage and subrogation and deductibles recoverable from policyholders. In 2009, the Company changed its method of accounting for the discounting of the long-term indemnity portion of workers compensation claims from tabular discount rates based on insurance regulations as approved by the respective jurisdictions to risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The liabilities for losses for most long-term disability payments under workers compensation were discounted at risk free rates in effect when the losses were incurred. Those rates were 3.7%, 4.0% and 4.8% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The weighted average discount rate for all years was 5.9% at December 31, 2009. The Company believes that the use of a risk-free discount rate is more reflective of market rates being earned on the assets supporting the respective liabilities and is therefore preferable to use rather than the imposed regulatory discount rates. The Company applied this change in method by retrospective application to the prior years financial statements. The cumulative effect of the change in the method of accounting resulted in an increase in the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 of $20, net of tax. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, the accounting change resulted in decreases in reinsurance recoverables, deferred income tax liability, and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of $8, $14 and $48, respectively, and an increase in retained earnings of $26 and no impact to claims and claim adjustment expenses, income tax expense and net income. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2008, the accounting change resulted in the following changes: decreases in reinsurance recoverables, deferred income tax liability and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of $9, $14 and $49, respectively, and increases in retained earnings, claims and claim adjustment expenses, income tax expense and net income of $26, $6, $2 and $4, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the accounting change resulted in the following changes: decreases in claims and claim adjustment expense, income tax expense and net income of $3, $1 and $2, respectively. Catastrophes can significantly impact the estimation of ultimate costs for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The estimation of reserves related to catastrophes can be affected by the inability of the Company and its policyholders to access portions of the impacted areas and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Other factors complicating the estimation process for catastrophes include F-12 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage; business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectability. The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information used to estimate reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available. Policyholder Dividends Policyholder dividends are accrued using an estimate of the ultimate amount to be paid in relation to premiums earned based on the underlying contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had a liability recorded in other liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheets for dividends declared to policyholders of $24 and $25, respectively. Certain insurance contracts, primarily workers compensation policies, are issued with dividend plans. The premium related to such policies approximated 1.5%, 2.1%, and 2.7% of premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Additionally, certain jurisdictions impose excess profits taxes, which limit the profitability of particular lines of business, and any excess is returned to the policyholder in the form of a dividend. Premium Revenue Recognition Premiums earned on insurance policies are generally reported as earned income on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the respective policies as coverage is provided. For insurance policies with variable premiums, premium estimates are reviewed and updated periodically with adjustments reflected in current operating results. Premiums receivables are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible premium amounts. Unearned premiums represent the unexpired portion of the policy premiums. Reinsurance All assets and liabilities related to ceded reinsurance contracts are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. Prospective reinsurance premiums and claims and claim adjustment expenses are accounted for on a basis consistent with the terms of the reinsurance contracts. The Companys consolidated statements of operations reflect premiums, benefits, and settlement expenses net of reinsurance ceded. Prepaid reinsurance premiums are premiums that are associated with future periods of coverage. Reinsurance transactions that do not transfer risk are included in other assets or other liabilities. Ceded transactions that transfer risk but are retroactive are included in reinsurance recoverables. The excess of estimated liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses over the consideration paid, net of any experience adjustments, is established as a deferred credit at inception. The deferred amounts are subsequently amortized using the effective interest method over the expected settlement period. The periodic amortization is reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of operations as part of general and administrative expenses. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liabilities associated with the reinsured business. The Company evaluates reinsurance collectability and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded. Amounts that are determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. Any subsequent collections are reported as part of claims and claim adjustment expenses. F-13 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Income Taxes The income tax provision is calculated under the liability method. The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Fee and Other Revenues Fee and other revenues are primarily comprised of premium installment fees and other miscellaneous revenue from involuntary assigned risk pools that are earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the related policies. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses are reported net of any portion associated with claims and include expenses associated with the various service agreements with Liberty Mutual and its affiliates (see Note 14  Related Party Transactions for additional detail), intangible amortization, bad debt expenses, as well as other expenses associated with the Companys insurance operations and commissions and the net impact of the capitalization of policy acquisition costs. Also included in general and administrative expenses are the Companys advertising expenses, which are all expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company expensed $23, $6 and $5, respectively, related to advertising. Insurance-Related Assessments The Company includes a liability for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments in other liabilities. States in which the Company writes business can assess the Company for certain obligations in the event that an insurer in that state becomes insolvent. The states typically assess the Company based on the amount of premium that the Company writes in the state or the amount of losses that the Company has incurred or has paid by its various entities in that state. Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. The assessment is based on future premiums. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted. (2) ACQUISITIONS Safeco Corporation On September 22, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of Safeco. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company paid cash of $68.25 per share in exchange for all outstanding shares of the Safeco common stock for a total purchase price of $6,244. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements subsequent to September 22, 2008. In 2008, net income for Safeco subsequent to acquisition was $74. The operations of Safeco were merged into the Company. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was F-14 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) primarily determined using the income approach, which discounts expected cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The purchase price allocation based on the opening balance sheet of Safeco was as follows: Assets: Total investments $ 8,600 Cash and cash equivalents 971 Premium and other receivables 1,071 Reinsurance recoverables 427 Goodwill 2,683 Other assets 1,732 Total assets $ 15,484 Liabilities: Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 5,332 Unearned premiums 2,301 Long-term debt 505 Other liabilities 1,102 Total liabilities $ 9,240 The following table details the intangible assets that resulted from the Safeco acquisition: Carrying Carrying Value Value December 31, December 31, Opening 2009 2008 Balance Sheet Period (Years) Method Agency relationship $ 564 $ 605 $ 616 15 Straight-line Trademarks 229 229 229 Not subject to amortization Not subject to amortization State licenses(1) 60 63 63 Not subject to amortization Not subject to amortization Leases 17 14 12 Variable up to 10 Present value mid-year convention Total intangible assets(2) $ 870 $ 911 $ 920 (1) On August 31, 2009 the Company transferred state insurance licenses to an insurance subsidiary of Liberty Mutual for consideration of $3. (2) The above table excludes the acquired in-force policy intangible, which is included in deferred policy acquisition costs and acquired in-force policy intangibles on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Acquired In-Force Policy Intangibles for additional detail. F-15 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 the Company recognized amortization expense related to the Safeco acquisition, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2009 2008 Agency relationship $ 41 $ 11 Leases (3 ) (2 ) Total amortization $ 38 $ 9 Estimated amortization expense for the years ending December 31, 2010 through 2014 is $42, $42, $43, $44, and $44, respectively. In connection with the Safeco acquisition, the Company paid an investment bank $10 to assist with the transaction. The Company incurred certain restructuring and integration costs as a result of the Safeco acquisition. In 2008, the Companys management approved a plan to restructure and integrate Safeco into the Companys existing operations. Under this plan, employees were severed, locations closed and contracts terminated for both the acquired Safeco as well as the Company. These actions commenced almost immediately upon closing of the Safeco transaction and continued throughout 2008 and 2009. The integration staffing plans identified staffing levels by department. Redundant positions were identified and eliminated first. Employees whose activities are or would be critical to transition or integration were identified and given retention packages. Employees who were not selected to fill authorized positions were eliminated and received termination benefits. Contract terminations and other transitional activities include costs to consolidate or close facilities or terminate other contracts as well as costs to relocate employees to other facilities. Costs to terminate an operating lease or terminate other contract include costs to terminate the contract before the end of its term and costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Total integration costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $65 and $103, of which $42 and $70, respectively, were recognized as assumed liabilities as part of purchase accounting for the acquisition.

Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company paid cash of $44.00 per share in exchange for all outstanding shares of the Ohio Casualty common stock for a total purchase price of $2,780. Ohio Casualty is presented as a consolidated subsidiary of the Company in its historical financial statements subsequent to August 24, 2007. In 2007 net income for Ohio Casualty subsequent to acquisition was $57. The operations of Ohio Casualty were merged into the Company. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was primarily determined using the income approach, which discounts expected cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management.

In connection with the Ohio Casualty acquisition, the Company paid an investment bank $7 to assist with the transaction. The Company incurred certain restructuring and integration costs as a result of the Ohio Casualty acquisition. In 2007, the Companys management approved a plan to restructure and integrate Ohio Casualty into the Companys existing operations. Under this plan, employees were severed, locations closed and contracts terminated for both the acquired Ohio Casualty as well as the Company. These actions commenced almost immediately upon execution of the Ohio Casualty transaction and continued throughout 2007, 2008 and 2009. The integration plan identified staffing levels by department. Redundant positions were identified and eliminated first. Employees whose activities are or would be critical to transition or integration were identified and given retention packages. Employees who were not selected to fill authorized positions were eliminated and received termination benefits. Contract terminations and other transitional activities include costs to consolidate or close facilities or terminate other contracts as well as costs to relocate employees to other facilities. Costs to terminate an operating lease or terminate other contract include costs to terminate the contract before the end of its term and costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Total integration costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $0, $(1) and $38, of which $0, $0 and $26, respectively, were recognized as assumed liabilities as part of purchase accounting for the acquisition.

These acquisitions resulted in significant cost synergies and other benefits throughout Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual performed an impairment analysis in the third quarter of 2009 using an income-based approach. Based on that analysis, the fair market value of Liberty Mutuals Agency Markets business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment was necessary. However, because the legal entities that gave rise to this goodwill are part of the Company, when the Company prepared these carve-out financial statements it was required under GAAP to record the full amount of the historical goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet and to test that goodwill for the consolidated financial statements at each of the Companys reporting units (i.e., segments), only taking into account the synergies and benefits realized by each of the Companys segments, without regard to synergies and benefits realized elsewhere in Liberty Mutual. The Company conducted an impairment analysis on each of the Companys segments on this required basis in the fourth quarter of 2008, and determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for the Companys Personal segment exceeded its fair value, and recognized an impairment charge in the Personal segment of $973 in 2008. However the carrying value of goodwill recorded in the consolidated financial statements of Liberty Mutual was unaffected.

Included in the $157 of unrealized losses for greater than 12 months was $74 of unrealized losses on securities that had been in an unrealized loss position of 10% or greater for more than 12 months. The Company monitors the difference between the amortized cost and estimated fair value of investments to ascertain whether declines in value are temporary in nature. Based on that evaluation and the Companys ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a recovery of fair value, the Company views the decline in market value of these investments as being temporary. More than 83% of the Companys securitized portfolio at December 31, 2009 was explicitly backed by the U.S. government (GNMA and SBA) or by government-sponsored entities (FHLMC and FNMA). Over 94% of these holdings remained rated AAA. At December 31, 2009, the commercial mortgage backed securities portfolio was well diversified and of high quality with over 85% rated AA or above. As of December 31, 2009, no single issuer, excluding U.S. Treasuries, agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, accounted for more than 1% of invested assets. Variable Interest Entities The Company invests in private equity and real estate limited partnerships and other entities subject to VIE analysis under the VIE subsections of ASC 810. The Company analyzes each investment to determine whether it is a VIE, and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary or a significant interest holder based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment. The Company evaluates the design of the entity, the risks to which the entity was designed to expose the variable interest holder, and the extent of the Companys variable interest in the VIE. VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary but holds a variable F-28 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) interest, are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with ASC 323, Investments  Equity Method and Joint Ventures . The Companys variable interests in investment VIEs are principally private equity limited partnerships in which the Company has invested as a passive limited partner. The partnerships were deemed to be VIEs because the equity holders as a group lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the respective entitys economic performance. The VIEs generate variability primarily from investment portfolio performance and that variability is passed to equity holders. For these VIEs, the Company absorbs a portion, but not a majority, of this variability. The Company does not have unconsolidated VIEs in which it has a significant variable interest as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Further, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of any of its limited partnership VIEs. Limited partnership assets are included in other investments on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The unfunded commitment of VIEs also is included in the total unfunded commitment disclosure in Note 11  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. There is no recourse to the general credit of the Company for any VIE beyond the full amount of the Companys loss exposure. The Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the financial results of Montgomery Mutual Insurance Company, National Insurance Association, America First Lloyds Insurance Company, American States Lloyds Insurance Company and Safeco Lloyds Insurance Company. As a result, these entities are consolidated as part of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Securities Lending As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair values of fixed maturities loaned by the Company were approximately $544 and $263, respectively. Cash and short-term investments received as collateral in connection with the loaned securities were approximately $428 and $183 as of December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The fair value of other investments received as collateral in connection with the loaned securities was approximately $136 and $89 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Investments in Mortgage Loans At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying values of commercial mortgage loans were $271 and $201, respectively. The carrying value for 2009 reflects an allowance of $1. As of December 31, 2009, the Company did not hold any material non-income producing mortgage loans. The Companys participation in any one commercial mortgage loan acquired did not exceed 49% of the loan value at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the average total loan size was $1.5 and the average loan participation size was $0.1. The number of loans in the portfolio increased from 2,257 at December 31, 2008, to 2,469 at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009 approximately 91% of the loans were full or partial recourse to the borrower.

For 2007, the acquired in-force policy intangibles were recognized in conjunction with the Companys purchase of Ohio Casualty on August 24, 2007. (5) UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES The Company establishes reserves for payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses that arise from the policies issued. As required by applicable accounting rules, no reserves are established until losses occur, including losses from catastrophes. The Companys reserves are segmented into three major categories: reserves for reported claims (estimates made by claims adjusters); incurred but not reported (IBNR) representing reserves for unreported claims and supplemental reserves for reported claims; and reserves for the costs to settle claims. The Company establishes its reserves net of salvage and subrogation by line of business or coverage and year in which losses occur. Establishing loss reserves, including loss reserves for catastrophic events that have occurred, is an estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results of litigation, medical costs, the costs of repair materials, and labor rates can all affect ultimate claim costs. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate settlement can be. Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as property damage claims, tend to be easier to estimate than long-tail claims, such as workers compensation or general liability claims. As information develops that varies from past experience, provides additional data or, in some cases, augments data that previously was not considered sufficient for use in determining reserves, changes in the Companys estimate of ultimate liabilities may be required. The effects of these changes are reflected in current operating results. F-30 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Activity in unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of the Company are summarized as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Balance as of January 1 $ 12,651 $ 7,307 $ 4,327 Less: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 1,517 1,158 620 Net balance as of January 1 11,134 6,149 3,707 Balance attributable to acquisitions  4,928 2,128 Incurred attributable to: Current year 6,859 4,818 2,913 Prior years (702 ) (492 ) (312 ) Total incurred 6,157 4,326 2,601 Paid attributable to: Current year 3,443 2,414 1,223 Prior years 3,161 1,855 1,064 Total paid 6,604 4,269 2,287 Add: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 1,366 1,517 1,158 Balance as of December 31 $ 12,053 $ 12,651 $ 7,307 In 2009, incurred attributable to prior years represented a release of $702 and was primarily attributable to actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected and lower than expected severity trends within the commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines. Additionally, there was significant favorable loss development attributable to prior years in the general liability product line, driven by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends. In 2009, there were also favorable trends in private passenger automobile bodily injury claims resulting in improved estimates driven, in large part, by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends across multiple accident years. In 2008, incurred attributable to prior years represented a release of $492 and was primarily attributable to actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected and moderate severity trends within the commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines. Additionally, the Company experienced better than expected loss development in the general liability product line primarily driven by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends. In 2007, incurred attributable to prior years represented a release of $312 and was primarily attributable to actual losses emerging at levels lower than expected and moderate severity trends within the commercial multiple peril and commercial automobile product lines. Additionally, the Company experienced better than expected loss development in the general liability product line primarily driven by moderate severity and favorable frequency trends. The Company writes insurance policies that cover catastrophic events. The Companys policies cover unpredictable natural and other disasters, such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, floods, fires, terrorist attacks, and explosions. Although the Company purchases reinsurance to mitigate its exposure to certain catastrophic events, claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in its financial results for any fiscal year and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property-casualty insurance business and have contributed to material period-to-period fluctuations in the Companys results of operations and financial position. The level of catastrophe losses experienced in any period cannot be predicted and can be material to the results of operations and financial position of the F-31 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Company. Catastrophe losses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, were $445, $350 and $90, respectively. Included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are certain reserves discounted to the present value of estimated future payments. The held discounted reserves on the long-term indemnity portion of workers compensation claims as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $335 and $315, respectively and the held undiscounted reserves on these unpaid workers compensation claims were $510 and $492, respectively. For certain commercial lines of insurance, the Company offers insurance policies with variable premium whereby the ultimate insurance premium is dependent upon the claims incurred. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held $414 and $395, respectively, of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves related to experience-rated policies. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recognized premiums earned related to prior years of $3, $0, and $(2), respectively. Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses are recorded net of anticipated salvage and subrogation of $477 and $470 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (6) ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES The Company has exposure to asbestos and environmental claims that emanate principally from general liability policies written prior to the mid-1980s. In establishing the Companys asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company estimates case reserves for anticipated losses and bulk reserves for claim adjustment expenses and IBNR. The Company maintained casualty excess of loss reinsurance during certain of the relevant periods. The reserves include any reserves reported by ceding insurers on assumed reinsurance contracts. The Company does not discount asbestos and environmental reserves. The process of establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims is subject to greater uncertainty than the establishment of reserves for liabilities relating to other types of insurance claims. A number of factors contribute to this greater uncertainty surrounding the establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves, including, without limitation: (i) the lack of available and reliable historical claims data as an indicator of future loss development, (ii) the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage, (iii) the difficulty in identifying the source of asbestos or environmental contamination, (iv) the difficulty in properly allocating liability for asbestos or environmental damage, (v) the uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, (vi) the cost to resolve claims, and (vii) the collectability of reinsurance. The uncertainties associated with establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims and claim adjustment expenses are compounded by the differing, and at times inconsistent, court rulings on environmental and asbestos coverage issues involving: (i) the differing interpretations of various insurance policy provisions and whether asbestos and environmental losses are or were ever intended to be covered, (ii) when the loss occurred and what policies provide coverage, (iii) whether there is an insured obligation to defend, (iv) whether a compensable loss or injury has occurred, (v) how policy limits are determined, (vi) how policy exclusions are applied and interpreted, (vii) the impact of entities seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, (viii) whether clean-up costs are covered as insured property damage, and (ix) applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. These uncertainties cannot be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on the Companys future operating results and financial condition. In the last few years the Company, as well as the general industry, has seen decreases in the number of asbestos claims being filed. This turn to a more favorable trend is due to a number of factors. Screening F-32 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) activity used by some lawyers to find new plaintiffs utilized questionable practices discovered in the Federal Silica Multi District Litigation. Court decisions in several key states (e.g., Mississippi) have been favorable to defendants. Most importantly, several states have enacted legislation in the past few years that contain medical criteria provisions aimed at reducing the number of lawsuits filed by unimpaired plaintiffs and providing prompt and fair compensation to those who meet the criteria. These reserves are reviewed biennially by a multi-disciplined team of internal claims, legal, reinsurance and actuarial personnel. Each legacy line of business was reviewed upon its acquisition by Liberty Mutual, and biennially thereafter by Liberty Mutual. Once these reviews are completed, reserves are trued up to the estimates for ultimate unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. Various benchmarks such as average payments, survival ratios, payments on known claims and newly reported claims are reviewed to ensure held reserve balances remain reasonable. While the periodic review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs materially from current reserves. The following tables summarize the activity related to the Companys asbestos and environmental claims and claim adjustment expenses, a component of the Companys unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Asbestos: Balance as of January 1 $ 347 $ 75 $ 21 Less: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 54 17 7 Net balance as of January 1 293 58 14 Balance attributable to acquisitions  234 45 Total incurred (3 ) 6  Total paid 23 5 1 Net balance as of December 31 267 293 58 Add: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 47 54 17 Balance as of December 31 314 347 75 Allowance for reinsurance on unpaid losses 8   Total unpaid losses including allowance for unpaid reinsurance $ 322 $ 347 $ 75 F-33 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 Environmental: Balance as of January 1 $ 169 $ 93 $ 24 Less: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 19 4 10 Net balance as of January 1 150 89 14 Balance attributable to acquisitions  83 33 Total incurred 6 (5 ) 49 Total paid 16 17 7 Net balance as of December 31 140 150 89 Add: unpaid reinsurance recoverables 20 19 4 Balance as of December 31 $ 160 $ 169 $ 93 (7) REINSURANCE In the ordinary course of business, the Company assumes reinsurance and also cedes reinsurance to other insurers to reduce overall risk, including exposure to large losses and catastrophic events. The Company cedes to reinsurers a portion of its risks and pays premiums based on the risk and exposure of the policies subject to this reinsurance. Reinsurance involves credit risk and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the Company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. The Company also holds collateral, including escrow funds and letters of credit, under reinsurance agreements. The Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers on an ongoing basis. Reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices and appropriate pricing of their product offerings. The limit of liability placed with any one reinsurer is restricted at an individual program level and for the reinsurer in total. The Company has crafted specific reinsurance contract language to assist in mitigating credit risk and/or addressing it when there are indications that the financial position of a reinsurer may be changing. A summary of the effects of reinsurance financial data reflected within the consolidated statements of operations is presented below: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Written Earned Written Earned Written Earned Direct $ 10,142 $ 10,221 $ 6,715 $ 6,715 $ 4,177 $ 4,114 Assumed 710 714 670 672 530 512 Ceded (704 ) (952 ) (681 ) (474 ) (300 ) (301 ) Net premiums $ 10,148 $ 9,983 $ 6,704 $ 6,913 $ 4,407 $ 4,325 F-34 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Claims and claim adjustment expenses Direct $ 5,937 $ 3,981 $ 2,575 Assumed 547 608 128 Ceded (327 ) (263 ) (102 ) Net $ 6,157 $ 4,326 $ 2,601 A summary of reinsurance financial data reflected within the consolidated balance sheets is presented below: As of December 31, 2009 2008 Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses Direct $ 10,044 $ 10,610 Assumed 2,009 2,041 Ceded (1,366 ) (1,517 ) Net $ 10,687 $ 11,134 As of December 31, 2009 2008 Unearned premiums Direct $ 4,420 $ 4,603 Assumed 238 234 Ceded (53 ) (297 ) Net $ 4,605 $ 4,540 The Company entered into a Homeowners Quota Share Treaty on a written premium basis effective December 31, 2008, ceding 31.725% of the Companys homeowners premium. The Company had $226 and $224 of written premium and $450 and $0 of earned premium associated with this contract for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Claims and claim adjustment expenses associated with the contract were $281 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Associated with the contract, the Company charged a ceding commission of $68 and $67 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Unearned premium associated with the contract as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $0 and $224, respectively. Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses associated with the contract as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $84 and $0, respectively. The contract terminated on December 31, 2009. F-35 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) The following table summarizes the Companys reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2009: Reinsurance Collateral Net Recoverables Held Recoverables A.M. Best Rated Reinsurers $ 1,164 $ 205 $ 959 Involuntary pools 259  259 Voluntary pools 8  8 Other(1) 124 17 107 Gross recoverables 1,555 222 1,333 Less: allowance 75  75 Net recoverables $ 1,480 $ 222 $ 1,258 (1) Includes $98 of net recoverables from non-rated reinsurers and $9 of net recoverables from captive and program business. The Company had significant reinsurance recoverable concentrations as of December 31, 2009, net of offsetting collateral under the contracts, as follows: Reinsurance Recoverables, Net of Offsetting Collateral Swiss Reinsurance Group $ 288 Liberty Mutual Group 179 Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group 140 Munich Re Group 89 Equitas Insurance Limited 48 PartnerRe Group 42 American International Group Inc. 24 Chubb Group of Insurance Companies 22 Everest Re Group 22 White Mountains Insurance Group 22 Total significant reinsurers $ 876 The reinsurance recoverables from state-mandated involuntary pools and associations represent the Companys servicing carrier business. As a servicing carrier, the Company retains no direct underwriting risk but instead cedes 100% of the involuntary market premium and losses back to the pool. Payment of losses is shared by the pool participants in proportion to their pool participation. Reinsurer credit risk with respect to any such involuntary pool or association is a function of the creditworthiness of all of the pool participants, jointly and severally. The Company is party to an assumed retroactive reinsurance arrangement. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, cumulative incurred losses related to these reinsurance arrangements were $76 and $65, respectively, and are included in other liabilities within the Companys consolidated balance sheets. There are no reinsurance recoverables related to these transactions. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company collected $333, $193 and $179 related to reinsurance recoveries. The Company has numerous reinsurance agreements in place with affiliates; see Note 14  Related Party Transactions for additional detail. The Company uses affiliated reinsurance principally for property catastrophe F-36 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) and workers compensation coverage. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, the Company ceded $60, $75 and $45, respectively, of premiums earned to Liberty Mutual and ceded incurred claims and claim adjustment expense of $16, $85 and $(8), respectively. Included in the reinsurance recoverable balance as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are $179 and $262, respectively, of recoverables from Liberty Mutuals insurance subsidiaries. The Company is also a member of various involuntary pools and associations and serves as a servicing carrier for residual market organizations. Revenue related to the servicing carrier included in fee and other revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were $6, $9 and $12. On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was enacted into Federal law and established the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (the Program), a temporary Federal program in the Department of the Treasury, that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. The Program was scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2005. Through two subsequent acts, the Program was extended through 2014. The three acts are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Terrorism Acts. In order for a loss to be covered under the Program (subject losses), the loss must meet certain aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an event that is certified as an act of terrorism by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The annual aggregate industry loss minimum is $100 through 2014. The original Program excluded from participation certain of the following types of insurance: Federal crop insurance, private mortgage insurance, financial guaranty insurance, medical malpractice insurance, health or life insurance, flood insurance, and reinsurance. The Terrorism Extension Act exempted from coverage certain additional types of insurance, including commercial automobile, professional liability (other than directors and officers), surety, burglary and theft, and farm-owners multiple peril. In the case of a war declared by Congress, only workers compensation losses are covered by the Terrorism Acts. The Terrorism Acts generally require that all commercial property casualty insurers licensed in the United States participate in the Program. Under the Program, a participating insurer is entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal Government for 85% of subject losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap. The deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of the Companys insurer affiliates direct earned premiums for covered lines for the preceding calendar year. The Company estimates the deductible for its insurer affiliates (including the insurance affiliates of Liberty Mutual) commercial policies subject to the Terrorism Acts (the aggregate amount the Companys insurer affiliates, which, pursuant to the Terrorism Act, includes the Companys insurer affiliates within the mutual aggregate deductible that are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the Company, will have to pay before the Federal backstop becomes available) to be $1,757 for 2010. The annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100,000. Once subject losses have reached the $100,000 aggregate during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the Program for additional covered terrorism losses for that program year. The Company has had no terrorism-related losses since the Program was established. Because the Terrorism Acts are relatively new and their interpretation is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how they will be applied to specific circumstances. It is also possible that future legislative action could change the Terrorism Acts. Further, given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in the Companys own reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly unconventional acts of terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could be material to the Companys operating results, financial position and/or liquidity in future periods. The Company will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring and controlling terrorism risk aggregations to the best of its ability.

See Note 2- Acquisitions for additional detail. On December 29, 2008, the following transactions occurred:  Liberty Mutual exchanged $281 of the outstanding $300 Safeco 4.875% Senior Notes due 2010 for a like principal amount of newly issued Liberty Mutual 4.875% Senior Notes due 2010.  Liberty Mutual exchanged $187 of the outstanding $204 Safeco 7.25% Senior Notes due 2012 for a like principal amount of newly issued Liberty Mutual 7.25% Senior Notes due 2012.  Liberty Mutual exchanged $180 of the outstanding $200 Ohio Casualty 7.30% Senior Notes due 2014 for a like principal amount of newly issued Liberty Mutual 7.30% Senior Notes due 2014. Safeco and Ohio Casualty received and accepted the requisite consents from existing debt holders to enable each to execute a supplemental indenture governing the Safeco and Ohio Casualty Senior Notes that remain outstanding. The supplemental indenture eliminated substantially all restrictive covenants and eliminated or modified certain events of default. Safeco and Ohio Casualty are named as guarantors of the newly issued Liberty Mutual Senior Notes that replace their respective debt. Liberty Mutual and one of its subsidiaries, LMHC Massachusetts Holdings, Inc., are also named as guarantors on each of the newly issued Liberty Mutual Senior Notes. As a result of this transaction, $648 of debt that was previously a liability for the Companys subsidiaries was extinguished and no gain or loss was recognized as the carrying value approximated fair value. In conjunction with this transaction, Safeco and Ohio Casualty issued preferred stock to Liberty Mutual. See Note 12  Stockholders Equity and Dividend Availability for further discussion of the preferred stock issuance. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had short-term debt of $19 and $0, respectively. The $19 relates to the 4.875% Note that is due in 2010. Long-term debt outstanding of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was as follows: 2009 2008 4.875% Notes, due 2010 $  $ 19 7.25% Notes, due 2012 17 17 7.30% Notes, due 2014 20 20 Capital lease(1) 21 25 Subtotal 58 81 Unamortized fair value adjustments 1 1 Total long-term debt excluding current maturities $ 59 $ 82 (1) Capital lease amounts represents a net amount that includes a gross asset of $25 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $4 and $0, respectively. Interest The Company paid $4, $25 and $7 of interest in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. F-38 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Capital Lease In 2008, the Company entered into an arrangement to sell and leaseback certain furniture and equipment. The weighted average interest rate on the lease is 5.23%. The transactions are accounted for as capital leases. The Company recorded a deferred gain on the transaction of $6 that is being amortized over the life of the agreement. Amortization of the lease obligation for December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $4 and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, our amortization of the lease obligation under the sale lease back arrangement through maturity is $5 for 2010, $5 for 2011, $5 for 2012, $5 for 2013 and $1 for 2014. Line of Credit Agreements The Company has revolving loan agreements with Liberty Mutual in the amount of $500 that expire on May 22, 2011, and $130 that expires on November 8, 2012. To date, no funds have been borrowed under the facility. (9) INCOME TAXES The Company joins in the filing of a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return through Liberty Mutual. The majority of the Companys operations are taxed in the United States. Pursuant to a tax sharing agreement among the Company and each of its subsidiary companies and Liberty Mutual, the consolidated tax liabilities are allocated to each company based on its separate return tax liability. Tax benefits are allocated to each company for its portion of net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards in the year they are used by the consolidated group. Intercompany tax balances are settled quarterly. The components of Federal and state income tax expense (benefit) are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Current tax expense: Federal $ 339 $ 249 $ 138 State 4 3 2 Total current tax expense 343 252 140 Total Federal deferred tax expense (benefit) 34 (174 ) 27 Income tax expense $ 377 $ 78 $ 167 A reconciliation of the income tax expense attributable to continuing operations computed at U.S. Federal statutory tax rates to the income tax expense as included in the Companys consolidated statements of operations follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Expected Federal income tax expense (benefit) $ 483 $ (170 ) $ 190 Tax effect of: Nontaxable investment income (120 ) (89 ) (31 ) Non-deductible Goodwill  341  Revision to estimates  (9 ) 14 State 4 3 2 Other 10 2 (8 ) Actual income tax expense $ 377 $ 78 $ 167 F-39 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) The current income tax payable was $132 and $6 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The significant components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, are summarized as follows: 2009 2008 Deferred tax assets: Unpaid claims discount $ 376 $ 373 Unearned premium reserves 326 339 Employee benefits/compensation 75 68 Other investment related items 151 160 Net unrealized losses and other-than-temporary impairments  311 Capital loss tax attribute 20  State insurance assessments 10 27 Other 322 173 Subtotal 1,280 1,451 Less: valuation allowance   Total deferred tax assets 1,280 1,451 Deferred tax liabilities: Deferred acquisition costs 375 365 Net unrealized gains 225  Goodwill 134 119 Intangibles 370 387 Other 228 71 Total deferred tax liabilities 1,332 942 Net deferred tax (liabilities) assets $ (52 ) $ 509 Based on the assumption that future levels of income will be achieved, management believes it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 will be realized. F-40 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its review of the Companys Federal income tax returns through the 1998 tax year and is currently reviewing income tax returns for the 1999 through 2007 tax years. Any adjustments that may result from the IRS examinations of these income tax returns are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity, or results of operations of the Company. The IRS has completed its review of the pre-acquisition Federal income tax returns of Ohio Casualty and Safeco through the 2006 and 2003 tax years, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Balance at January 1, 2008 $ 2 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (1 ) Increases in unrecognized tax benefits acquired or assumed in a business combination 5 Balance at December 31, 2008 6 Additions for tax positions of prior years 17 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (15 ) Settlements (2 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 6 Included in December 31, 2009 and 2008 balances above are $6 related to tax positions that would impact the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Federal and state income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recognized approximately $3, $0, and $0 in interest and penalties. The Company had approximately $6 and $3 of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company does not expect any material changes to the unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of the reporting date. (10) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and disclosures about fair value measurements. It provides guidance on how to measure fair value when required under existing accounting standards and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels (Level 1, 2 and 3). Level 1 inputs are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets in active markets the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, for the asset. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs reflecting the Companys estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset (including assumptions about risk). The hierarchy requires the use of market observable information when available for assessing fair value. The following tables summarize the Companys assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as F-41 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) of December 31, 2009 and 2008, along with a brief description of the valuation technique for each type of asset: Assets, at Fair Value as of December 31, 2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fixed maturities, available for sale: U.S. government and agency securities $ 613 $ 82 $ 30 $ 725 Mortgage and asset-backed securities: Residential  4,820 6 4,826 Commercial  537 15 552 Other mortgage and asset-backed securities  890 48 938 U.S. state and municipal  8,729 13 8,742 Corporate and other  4,133 192 4,325 Foreign government securities  17  17 Total fixed maturities, available for sale 613 19,208 304 20,125 Equity securities, available for sale: Common stock 41 42 2 85 Preferred stock  215 1 216 Total equity securities, available for sale 41 257 3 301 Short-term investments 107  2 109 Total assets at fair value $ 761 $ 19,465 $ 309 $ 20,535 Assets, at Fair Value as of December 31, 2008 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fixed maturities, available for sale: U.S. government and agency securities $ 495 $ 139 $ 15 $ 649 Mortgage and asset-backed securities: Residential  3,150 5 3,155 Commercial  474 11 485 Other mortgage and asset-backed securities  723 43 766 U.S. state and municipal  8,247 9 8,256 Corporate and other  3,264 225 3,489 Foreign government securities  20  20 Total fixed maturities, available for sale 495 16,017 308 16,820 Equity securities, available for sale Common stock  189 26 215 Preferred stock  285 1 286 Total equity securities, available for sale  474 27 501 Short-term investments 1 381  382 Total assets at fair value $ 496 $ 16,872 $ 335 $ 17,703 Fixed maturities and short-term investments are recorded at fair value in the Companys consolidated financial statements. In instances where there are quoted prices in active markets for identical fixed maturities and short term investments, as is the case within the U.S. Treasury market, these securities are categorized as F-42 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. For securities where the fair value of fixed maturity and short-term securities are estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations, bond spreads, or models that have inputs from published interest rate yield curves, these securities are generally categorized as Level 2 of the hierarchy. Additionally, in some instances where fixed maturity and short-term securities use significant inputs that are unobservable, they are categorized as Level 3 of the hierarchy. Equity securities are recorded at fair value in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The fair value of certain common stocks is based on quoted prices in active markets. Those common stocks are categorized as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The remaining common stocks are not publicly traded and their fair value is based on observable significant inputs and are categorized as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of preferred stocks is generally determined by quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; hence they are categorized as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, in some instances where equity securities use significant inputs that are unobservable, they are categorized as Level 3 of the hierarchy. Mortgage loans and limited partnership investments representing the majority of other investments on the balance sheet, are not subject to these disclosures and therefore are excluded from the above table. The following tables set forth the fair values of assets on a recurring basis classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Net Net Net Balance Realized Unrealized Purchases, Transfer in Balance January 1, Gains Gains (Sales) and and/or (out) December 31, 2009 (Losses) (Losses) (Maturities) of Level 3 2009 Fixed maturities: U.S. government and agency securities $ 15 $  $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 15 $ 30 Mortgage and asset-backed securities: Residential 5   (1 ) 2 6 Commercial 11  1 (1 ) 4 15 Other mortgage and asset-backed securities 43 2  (9 ) 12 48 U.S. state and municipal 9  1 (1 ) 4 13 Corporate and other 225 (1 ) 20 (40 ) (12 ) 192 Total fixed maturities 308 1 23 (53 ) 25 304 Equity securities: Common stock 26   (24 )  2 Preferred stock 1 (5 ) 5   1 Total equity securities 27 (5 ) 5 (24 )  3 Short-term investments    2  2 Total assets $ 335 $ (4 ) $ 28 $ (75 ) $ 25 $ 309 F-43 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Net Net Net Balance Realized Unrealized Purchases, Transfer in Balance January 1, Gains Gains (Sales) and and/or (out) December 31, 2008 (Losses) (Losses) (Maturities) of Level 3 2008 Fixed maturities: U.S. government and agency securities $  $  $  $ 1 $ 14 $ 15 Mortgage and asset-backed securities: Residential 18 (1 ) 1 1 (14 ) 5 Commercial 5  (1 ) 7  11 Other mortgage and asset-backed securities 21 (6 ) (5 ) (7 ) 40 43 U.S. state and municipal 14  (6 ) 2 (1 ) 9 Corporate and other 160 (3 ) (25 ) 54 39 225 Total fixed maturities 218 (10 ) (36 ) 58 78 308 Equity securities: Common stock 27  (3 ) 2  26 Preferred stock     1 1 Total equity securities 27  (3 ) 2 1 27 Short-term investments       Total assets $ 245 $ (10 ) $ (39 ) $ 60 $ 79 $ 335 There were no material unrealized gains (losses) for the period included in earnings attributable to the fair value relating to assets classified as Level 3 that are still held at December 31, 2009 or 2008. The fair values and carrying values of the Companys financial instruments excluded from ASC 820 at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: 2009 2008 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Value Value Value Value Other investments $ 150 $ 150 $ 190 $ 190 Mortgage loans 271 260 201 195 Cash and cash equivalents 1,548 1,548 1,968 1,968 Debt outstanding 78 81 82 77 Other investments: Fair values approximate the Companys equity in the limited partnerships net assets. Mortgage loans: The fair values were estimated using an option-adjusted discounted cash flow valuation. The valuation includes both observable market inputs and estimated model parameters. Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for these instruments approximate fair values. Debt outstanding: Fair values of short-term borrowings and capital lease obligations approximate carrying value. Fair values of long-term debt were based on either quoted market prices or estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Companys incremental borrowing rate at December 31, 2009 and 2008. On a non-recurring basis the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to determine fair value in its goodwill impairment testing. Using a market rate in the discounted cash flow model to measure the F-44 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Personal segment exceeded the fair value resulting in an impairment of goodwill of $973 as of December 31, 2008. See Note 2  Acquisitions for additional detail. The Company has not applied ASC 820 to non-financial assets and liabilities. (11) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Company is regularly involved in legal, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business. These include proceedings specific to the Company, including the Companys run-off operations, as well as proceedings generally applicable to the property casualty industry. Contingent liabilities arising from litigation, income taxes, and other matters are not considered material in relation to the financial position of the Company. The Society of Jesus, Oregon Province (the Debtor) has sought insurance coverage from certain of the Companys insurance subsidiaries acquired in the Safeco acquisition for certain claims by persons who claim sexual abuse by one or more persons associated with the Debtor. The Debtor, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2009 in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Oregon (the Bankruptcy Court), contends that one or more of the Safeco insurers issued liability policies to the Debtor for the period 1966  1992. Until its bankruptcy filing, the Company defended the Debtor against certain tort claims and paid certain indemnity amounts on behalf of the Debtor in connection with the tort claims, subject to a reservation of rights. On October 23, 2009, to advance resolution of certain of the coverage issues, the Company filed an adversary proceeding, General Insurance Co. of America v. Society of Jesus, Oregon Province, Adversary Proceeding Case No. 09-3351 (Bankr. D. Or.) (the Adversary Proceeding) against the Debtor, seeking a declaration that the Company does not have a duty to defend and/or indemnify the Debtor with respect to many of the tort claims. The Company and the Debtor are the only parties to the Adversary Proceeding. The Debtor has answered and counterclaimed for declaratory relief; discovery is proceeding pursuant to an agreed schedule approved by order of December 17, 2009. The Company and the Debtor are currently participating in a court ordered mediation, along with representatives of certain tort claimants, which process, if successful, would resolve the parties insurance coverage disputes, as well as all pending and future tort claims. Multiple issues exist which bear on whether and to what extent the Company owes insurance coverage to the Debtor. The most crucial insurance issues include the following: (1) the existence or lack of insurance coverage provided by the Company during certain years (sometimes referred to as the missing policy issue); (2) whether the acts complained of by the claimants constitute an occurrence as defined in the insurance policies, and/or whether they are excluded by certain terms and exclusions in the policies, because the alleged acts by the priests were not unexpected or unintended from the perspective of the Debtor; (3) if coverage is available, how many occurrences triggering coverage occurred in a given policy period; and (4) who is and is not covered as an insured under the policies, including the issue of whether non-priest Debtor personnel are covered. Limited discovery is now ongoing by all parties in the mediation. Finally, the creditors committee of the Debtor has announced that it will challenge the validity of the November 2007 Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement entered into by the Debtor and Safeco (the Alaska Settlement Agreement), under which Safeco paid consideration on behalf of the Debtor, in return for a full release of all past, present and future claims against the Debtor alleging clergy abuse that took place in Alaska. Both the Company and the Debtor maintain that the Alaska Settlement Agreement is a valid and binding agreement. Although the creditors committee recently moved for leave of court to prosecute such action, the matter is temporarily being held in abeyance by agreement of the parties, pending the outcome of the mediation. F-45 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) In 2008, Safeco, prior to being acquired by the Company, became a participating insurer in the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), a publicly managed, privately funded organization that provides residential earthquake insurance in California. California requires insurers selling homeowners insurance in the state to offer earthquake insurance either directly or through participation in the CEA. The Companys exposure to potential losses from California earthquakes is limited through participation in the CEA. As a new participating insurer in the CEA, the CEA assessed the Company an initial capital contribution of $47 based on the Companys combined share of the market for CEA residential earthquake insurance. The initial assessment was expensed in 2008 and was paid in twelve equal monthly installments, which began in December 2008. The Company is also subject to future additional assessments by the CEA if the capital of the CEA falls below $350. If losses arising from an earthquake cause a deficit in the CEA, then the CEA would obtain additional funding through reinsurance proceeds and assessments on participating insurers. Future assessments on participating CEA insurers are based on their CEA insurance market share as of December 31 of the preceding year. As a new participating insurer, the Company is also subject to a potential risk capital surcharge in addition to the initial capital contribution and additional assessments. New participating insurers may be required to pay the CEA up to five annual risk capital surcharges. The risk capital surcharge would be equal to the CEAs increased cost of providing capacity to insure the new participating insurers excess earthquake insurance risk. The risk capital surcharge will be calculated twelve months after the date the participating insurer first placed or renewed into the authority earthquake insurance policies. Although the Company is subject to future assessments by the CEA, the Company believes that its participation in the CEA has significantly reduced the Companys exposure to earthquake losses in California. The Company leases certain office facilities under operating leases expiring in various years through 2018. The leases generally contain market rate renewal options and allow for certain scheduled rental increases as well as increases due to operating expense escalation. Rental expense amounted to $60, $35, and $17, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The acquisition of Safeco increased rent expense by $16 for the year ended December 31, 2008 and by an additional $33 for the year ended December 31, 2009. Rental income was $4, $1 and $1 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The total future minimum rental payments include $92 for the Companys lease of office space at 1001 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98154. The lease has a term through October 31, 2018, with two 5-year options to renew at 95% of fair market value and two partial termination options. Base rent is scheduled to increase over the lease term. Future minimum rental payments and receipts under non-cancelable leases with terms in excess of one year are estimated as follows: Operating Rental Net Lease Leases Income Obligations 2010 $ 41 $ 4 $ 37 2011 42 4 38 2012 42 3 39 2013 31 3 28 2014 29 2 27 2015  2018 82  82 Total $ 267 $ 16 $ 251 At December 31, 2009, the Company had unfunded capital commitments related to private equity, real estate, and other investments of $294. F-46 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) At December 31, 2009, the Company had commitments to purchase various mortgage-backed securities settling in 2010, at a cost and fair value of $119, which are included as fixed maturities in the consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the acquisition of Safeco, the Company owns the naming rights to Safeco Field, a Major League Baseball park in Seattle, Washington, and will make payments through 2018. The future payments associated with these rights are $7 for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, $8 in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and $9 in 2018. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the liability was $31. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, included in other assets were $4 and $2, respectively, of related assets for premium tax offsets or policy surcharges. The related asset is limited to the amount that is determined based on future premium collections or policy surcharges from policies in force. Current assessments are expected to be paid out over the next five years, while premium tax offsets are expected to be realized within one year. The Company collects taxes from its policyholders on behalf of various government agencies. The Company recorded $10 and $12 as a liability, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (12) STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY Preferred Stock In December 2008, Safeco issued 10,000 shares of Series A Non Voting Preferred Stock, with no stated par value for $468 to Liberty Mutual. All 10,000 authorized shares are issued and outstanding. These shares are senior to all common stock and all other series of the Companys preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets. Holders are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash. The amount of such dividends per share annually are equal to ten percent (10%) per annum of the initial purchase price per share. The holders of these shares are not entitled to any voting rights. In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, no distributions are made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior to the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock until the owners of the Safeco Series A Non Voting Preferred Stock have been paid an amount equal to the initial purchase price per share the accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared at the date of payment. The holders have no right to cause the Company to redeem such shares without the Companys consent and the Company has no right to cause any holder of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to redeem such shares without such holders consent. The Company may repurchase its own shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to the full extent permitted by applicable law. The shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock are not convertible into shares of common stock. These shares may not be issued in fractions of a share. As of December 31, 2009 there were no dividends in arrears. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Safeco paid $47 out of retained earnings in dividends to the owners of its Series A Non Voting Preferred Stock. In December 2008, Ohio Casualty issued 920 shares of Series A Non Voting Preferred Stock, with no stated par value for $165 to Liberty Mutual. These shares are senior to all common stock and all other series of the Companys preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets. Holders are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash. The amount of such dividends per share annually are equal to ten percent (10%) per annum of the initial purchase price per share. The holders of these shares are not entitled to any voting rights. In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, no distribution are made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior to the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock until the owners of the Ohio Casualty Series A Non Voting Preferred Stock have F-47 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) been paid an amount equal to the initial purchase price per share plus an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions whether or not declared at the date of payment. The holders have no right to cause the Company to redeem such shares without the Companys consent and the Company have no right to cause any holder of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to redeem such shares without such holders consent. The Company may repurchase its own shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to the full extent permitted by applicable law. The shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock are not convertible into shares of common stock. These shares may not be issued in fractions of a share. As of December 31, 2009 there were no dividends in arrears and for the year ended December 31, 2009, Ohio Casualty paid $16 out of retained earnings in dividends to the owners of its Series A Non Voting Preferred Stock. Common Stock On August 4, 1995, the Company issued 1,000 shares of common stock to Liberty Mutual with $1.00 par value per share, All 1,000 authorized shares are issued and outstanding. Dividend Availability Dividends paid to stockholders totaled $84, $979 and $0 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends is restricted under applicable insurance law and regulations. Under the insurance laws of the domiciliary states of the insurance subsidiaries, an insurer may make an ordinary dividend payment if its surplus as regards to policyholders, following such dividend, is reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities, is adequate to its financial needs and does not exceed the insurers unassigned surplus. However, no insurer may pay an extraordinary dividend without the approval or non-disapproval of the domiciliary insurance regulatory authority. Under the insurance laws of New Hampshire, the domiciliary state of Peerless Insurance Company, an extraordinary dividend is defined as a dividend whose fair market value, together with other dividends made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurers surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31, or the insurers net income for the 12-month period ending on the preceding December 31. Under the insurance laws of Indiana, the domiciliary state of Indiana Insurance Company, American States Insurance Company, American States Preferred Insurance Company and American Economy Insurance Company, an extraordinary dividend is defined as a dividend that exceeds in any one year the greater of ten percent of the surplus as regards to policyholders as of December 31, or the net income provided such dividend does not impair capital or capital stock. Under the insurance laws of Ohio, the domiciliary state of Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, an extraordinary dividend is defined as a dividend that exceeds in any one year the greater of ten percent of the surplus as regards to policyholders as of December 31, or the net income provided such dividend does not impair capital or capital stock. Under the insurance laws of Washington, the domiciliary state of General Insurance Company of America and Safeco Insurance Company of America, an extraordinary dividend is defined as a dividend whose fair market value, together with other dividends made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of (a) 10% of the insurers surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31, or (b) the insurers net income for the 12-month period ending on the preceding December 31. In addition, all domiciliary states define extraordinary dividends as those where the dividend exceeds the insurers unassigned surplus. The Washington Insurance Commissioners order approving the Safeco acquisition provides that, for 24 months from the closing, neither ordinary nor extraordinary dividends may be declared by Safecos Washington domestic insurers without prior approval by the Commissioner. Such restriction continues through September 22, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum allowable dividend from the insurance subsidiaries to the Company without prior regulatory approval was $813. See Note 16  Subsequent Events for detail on dividends that were paid in 2010. F-48 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Statutory Net Income and Surplus Statutory net income for the Companys insurance subsidiaries and controlled insurance affiliates was $965, $797 and $440 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Statutory net income for December 31, 2008 and 2007 included a full year of operations for Safeco and Ohio Casualty, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus for the Companys insurance subsidiaries and controlled insurance affiliates including Safeco and Ohio Casualty was $7,256 and $5,785 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Companys insurance subsidiaries prepare the statutory basis financial statements in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (NAIC APP), subject to any deviations prescribed or permitted by the insurance commissioners of the various insurance companies states of domicile. The Company does not have any material permitted practices that deviate from the NAIC APP. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists principally of unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities, and pension and postretirement liability adjustments. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 are as follows: As of December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Unrealized gains (losses) on securities $ 503 $ (477 ) $ 12 Minimum pension liability adjustments (15 ) (10 )  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax $ 488 $ (487 ) $ 12 (13) SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company is organized into three operating segments: Commercial, Personal and Surety. The accounting policies used to generate the following segment data are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1. For purposes of reporting segment information, all underwriting activity is reflected in the applicable segment. The Company allocates certain management fee and overhead expenses to its segments based on various factors including statutory surplus, allocable salary dollars, direct written premium and other considerations. The Company allocates its invested assets and the related net investment income to its reportable market segments. A benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average yield on the total investment portfolio. The benchmark yields are applied to each segments allocated invested assets and cash flow, to produce a notional investment income by segment. The difference between allocated net investment income and actual net investment income is included in Corporate and Other. Net realized investment gains (losses) are significantly impacted by both discretionary and economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating results. For that reason, net realized investment gains (losses) are included in Corporate and Other. Run-off operations, internal reinsurance, and interest expense are also reflected in Corporate and Other. Inter-Segment Revenue and Expenses Allocation of Net Investment Income The Company allocates a notional investment account and the related net investment income to each of its business segments. The notional investment account is equal to the beginning of year insurance liabilities for the segments plus capital allocated to the segments. Cash flow from operations during the year adds to the F-49 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) balance. A benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average planned total return on the Companys investment portfolio and applies the benchmark investment yields to each business segments notional investment account as of the beginning of each year plus current year operating cash flows to produce total investment income by business segment. The difference between the actual net investment income and the allocated business segment investment income is reported in the Corporate and Other business segment along with all realized investment gains and losses. Inter-segment Reinsurance Arrangements The Company reinsures risks with external reinsurers on a company-wide basis through the Corporate and Other segment, which permits the Company to leverage scale and diversification to maximize the efficiency of its external reinsurance purchases, and obtain more favorable terms than could any individual segment. The Company uses inter-segment reinsurance arrangements as a tool to provide the Commercial and Personal segments the flexibility to retain the risks and benefits each operating segment believes to be appropriate given the size and scope of its segment operations. The terms of the Companys inter-segment reinsurance arrangements are finalized during the Companys annual planning process in advance of the effective date and are reflected in the operating results of the Companys segments on a basis that is consistent with external reinsurance. The Company believes that the inter-segment reinsurance arrangements pricing reflected in its results is consistent with market pricing. The use of inter-segment reinsurance arrangements have no effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The following tables summarize the components of the Companys operating revenues, operating income (loss) before income tax expense, total assets by operating segments and inter-segment revenue and expenses.

The costs allocated to the Company and its subsidiaries for these services have been determined on a basis that Liberty Mutual and the Company consider to be a reasonable allocation for the use of services provided or the benefits received by the Company and its subsidiaries. Costs for the services totaled $1,806, $1,020 and $799 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Within the Company there are also servicing agreements between various subsidiaries.

Included in these service costs are expenses related to the Companys eligible dedicated employees who are covered by Liberty Mutuals defined benefit plans, the Liberty Mutual Retirement Benefit Plan and Supplemental Income at Retirement Plan (SIRP) plans. The Companys eligible dedicated employees also participate in the Thrift-Incentive Plan and SIRP defined contribution pension plans sponsored by Liberty Mutual.

The Company is responsible for any taxes with respect to tax returns that include only the Company and its subsidiaries. See Note 9  Income Taxes for additional detail.

The Company also exchanged a portion of the senior notes that were acquired with Safeco and Ohio Casualty for Safeco and Ohio Casualty preferred shares of stock with Liberty Mutual in December 2008. Further details on all credit facilities and debt transactions can be found in Note 8  Debt Outstanding. Payable to / receivable from related parties In the course of normal operations, the Company and Liberty Mutual incur expenses on each others behalf as part of the various service and reinsurance agreements that are in place. These amounts are net settled at least every 45 days and no interest is charged on the outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company owed to Liberty Mutual $1,413 and $1,373. Included in the balance as of December 31, 2009 is $1,007 that is owed to Liberty Mutual as a result of the termination of the reinsurance agreement between the Company and Liberty Mutual with respect to the Summit insurance companies. In addition, prior to completing the offering, the Company will cause to be transferred Summit to Liberty Mutual. The results of Summit and the related intercompany reinsurance agreements have been excluded from the historical results of the Company for all periods presented. However, the Company received $1,026 of cash and investments from Liberty Mutual in 2008 related to the reinsurance agreements. This amount has been recorded as a deposit and is included in payable to affiliates. As of January 1, 2010, the Company terminated the related reinsurance agreements and will return $1,007 in cash and investments to Liberty Mutual related to the deposit. See Note 16  Subsequent Events for additional detail. (15) BENEFIT PLANS Liberty Mutual maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan) which covers substantially all of its employees. This includes employees who are currently in Liberty Mutual business units including the Companys subsidiaries. The benefits and eligibility are based on age, years of service, and the employees final average compensation, as more fully described in the Pension Plan document. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recognized expense of $79, $29, and $24 respectively, in connection with the Pension Plan benefits related to Liberty Mutual employee services rendered to the Company. Liberty Mutual maintains non-qualified supplemental pension plans to restore to selected highly compensated employees the pension benefits to which they would be entitled under the Pension Plan had it not been F-54 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) for limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. These plans include employees who are currently in Liberty Mutual business units including the Companys subsidiaries. The supplemental plans are unfunded. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recognized expense of $4, $3, and $3 respectively in connection with Liberty Mutual non-qualified supplemental pension plan benefits related to Liberty Mutual employee services rendered to the Company. Liberty Mutual maintains plans that provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits (Postretirement) covering substantially all of their employees. This includes employees who are currently in Liberty Mutual business units including the Companys subsidiaries. Life insurance benefits are based on a participants final compensation subject to the plan maximum. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recognized expense of $21, $12, and $7 respectively in connection with Liberty Mutual Postretirement plan benefits related to Liberty Mutual employee services rendered to the Company. The Company acquired Safeco and Ohio Casualty effective September 22, 2008, and August 24, 2007, respectively. With the exception of the Safeco Cash Balance Plan (Safeco Pension Plan), the non-qualified American States Insurance Supplemental Pension Plan (ASI Supplemental Pension), and non-qualified deferred compensation and retirement bonus plans sponsored by Safeco and its predecessors, (collectively the Safeco/ASI Deferred Compensation Plans), the Safeco and Ohio Casualty benefit plans were combined with the Liberty Mutual benefit plans results after purchase price allocation adjustments for all post-acquisition periods. The Safeco Pension Plan, a qualified defined benefit plan, is maintained as a separate plan and no further benefits were accrued effective December 31, 2007. Action was taken to terminate the Safeco Pension Plan effective December 31, 2008, and the plan sponsor has requested a favorable IRS determination letter. The ASI Supplemental Pension plan is frozen and is being maintained as a separate plan. The Safeco/ASI Deferred Compensation Plans are all frozen, and some are in the process of being terminated. Liberty Mutual maintains a defined contribution savings plan (a 401(k) plan) for substantially all employees. Liberty Mutual maintains supplemental defined contribution plans for all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. This includes employees who are currently in Liberty Mutual business units including the Companys subsidiaries. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, employees could contribute a percentage of their annual compensation on a before and after-tax basis, subject to Federal limitations. The benefits are based on the employees contributions and matching contributions which are based in part upon profitability. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recognized expense of $45, $26, and $18 respectively, in connection with Liberty Mutual defined contribution savings plan benefits related to Liberty Mutual employee services rendered to the Company. In addition, the Company recognized expense of $10 in 2008 in connection with the Safeco 401(k)/Profit Sharing Retirement Plan and recognized expense of $6 in 2007 in connection with the Ohio Casualty Insurance Company Employee Savings Plan. At December 31, 2009, the Companys obligations associated with the Safeco/ASI Deferred Compensation Plans were $5. Deferred payment obligations under predecessor separation agreements at December 31, 2009 were $6. Compensation expense within the Liberty Mutual long-term and short-term incentive compensation plans related to employees in the Liberty Mutual business units providing service to the Company was $87, $68, and $54, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, assets of the Safeco Pension Plan totaling $120 and $142, respectively were held in trust consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The following table sets forth the assets, obligations, and assumptions associated with the Safeco Pension Plan and ASI Supplemental Pension Benefits. The amounts are recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

In 2009, the yield curve was developed from a December 31, 2009 Hewitt Top Quartile Yield Curve. The process calculated the present value of these cash flows and determined the equivalent single discount rate that produced the same present value of the future cash flows. The equivalent single discount rate was then rounded to the nearest 5 basis points. In 2008, the yield curve was developed from the December 31, 2008 Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The process calculated the present value of these cash flows and determined the equivalent single discount rate that produced the same present value of the future cash flows. The equivalent single discount rate was then rounded to the nearest 25 basis points. In choosing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Safeco Benefit Plans Investment and Administrative Committee considered the historical returns of equity and fixed income markets in conjunction with current economic and financial market conditions. Plan Assets The asset allocation percentages of the Safeco Pension Plan were changed in 2009 as a result of the plan termination and the need to retain liquidity in anticipation of the settlement of the Plans obligations by the end of 2010. Prior to 2009, the fundamental investment policies of the Safeco Pension Plan had been formulated to balance the primary objectives of (1) achieving long-term growth sufficient to fund, as fully practicable, future obligations and (2) supporting the short-term requirement of meeting current benefit payments, all after giving due consideration to the underlying characteristics of the Companys employment base. The Safeco Pension Plan assets are invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments and investment grade bonds in anticipation of the Safeco Pension Plan liquidation in 2010. F-58 Table of Contents Liberty Mutual Agency Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) (dollars in millions except per share amounts) The Safeco Pension Plans assets are administered by the Safeco Benefit Plans Investment and Administrative Committee who has fiduciary responsibility for management of the Safeco Pension assets.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and officers as well as other employees and individuals against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed actions, suits or proceedings in which such person is made a party by reason of such person being or having been a director, officer, employee or agent to the registrant. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that Section 145 is not exclusive of other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. The registrants certificate of incorporation provides for indemnification by the registrant of its directors, officers and employees to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation that a director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (3) for unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, redemptions or other distributions; or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The registrants certificate of incorporation and bylaws provides for such limitation of liability to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. The registrant will maintain standard policies of insurance under which coverage is provided (1) to its directors and officers against loss arising from claims made by reason of breach of duty or other wrongful act, while acting in their capacity as directors and officers of the registrant and (2) to the registrant with respect to payments which may be made by the registrant to such officers and directors pursuant to any indemnification provision contained in the registrants certificate of incorporation or otherwise as a matter of law. In addition, the registrant may in the future enter into indemnification agreements (in the form filed as Exhibit 10.13 hereto) for the benefit of its executive directors and officers.

Exhibits and Financial Statements Schedules (A) Exhibits The agreements included as exhibits to this registration statement contain representations and warranties by each of the parties to the applicable agreement. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the applicable agreement and:  should not in all instances be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate;  have been qualified by disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the application agreement, which disclosures are not necessarily reflected in the agreement;  may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material to you or other investors; and  were made only as of the date of the applicable agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the agreement and are subject to more recent developments. Accordingly, these representations and warranties may not describe the actual state of affairs as of the date they were made or at any other time. The registrant acknowledges that, notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing cautionary statements, it is responsible for considering whether additional specific disclosures of material information regarding material contractual provisions are required to make the statements in this registration statement not misleading.

Undertakings Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to the registrants directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by the registrant is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. The registrant hereby undertakes that: (i) for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (ii) for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
