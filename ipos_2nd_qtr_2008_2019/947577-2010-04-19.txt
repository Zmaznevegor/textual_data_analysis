OUR COMPANY We are the leading national provider of fountain and draught beer beverage carbonation solutions to the restaurant and hospitality industry. Our solutions combine equipment for the storage, blending, and dispensing of beverage grade carbon dioxide, or CO 2 , and nitrogen, or N 2 , gases, with continuous, unprompted beverage gas supply service to customer locations via long-term agreements. In combination, our equipment and beverage gas supply services are designed to ensure uninterrupted fountain and draught beer beverage carbonation for our customers. Our customers are primarily quick service restaurant chains, or QSRs, as well as other restaurant chains, bars, convenience store chains, and sports and entertainment venues. Our solutions maximize our customers' cost effectiveness, operational efficiency and carbonation supply reliability by replacing costly, more cumbersome and less reliable high pressure beverage gas cylinders, at a small monthly cost with no upfront investment for the customer. We believe our value proposition remains strong and durable, as beverage carbonation is critically important to our QSR and other customers, who derive the largest portion of store level profitability from high-margin fountain and draught beer beverage revenues. As a result, we have a highly visible revenue base supported by long-term service agreements with high renewal rates and a significant national presence with substantial barriers to entry. We believe we have strong growth potential, as our solutions remain underpenetrated in our target markets despite our current leading market share position. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we generated revenues of $163.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $62.9 million. Our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA grew at a compound annual growth rate of 12.3% and 12.8%, respectively, from the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see the section entitled "Discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA" below. OUR MARKETS We serve the U.S. fountain and draught beer retail beverage market, which consists of an aggregate of approximately 625,000 restaurant and hospitality locations nationwide. Our fountain beverage bulk CO 2 solutions, which currently represent a majority of our revenues, are customized to individually serve both high beverage volume and moderate beverage volume customer locations, as defined by estimated annual soda syrup consumption per fountain location, which we believe is a proxy for store-level beverage gas consumption. Our newly-introduced Mini-Bulk solutions are designed for moderate volume locations. We consider those locations that use more than 500 gallons of fountain syrup per year to be high volume, those locations that use between 300 and 500 gallons of fountain syrup per year to be moderate volume and those locations that use less than 300 gallons of fountain syrup per year to be low volume. We estimate that there are approximately 210,000 U.S. locations in the addressable market for our high volume fountain beverage solutions, of which we currently service approximately 121,000 locations, or 58%. We also estimate the moderate volume market opportunity is approximately 85,000 locations in the U.S., of which we currently service approximately 8,000 locations, or 9%. The remaining approximately 330,000 locations in the U.S. retail fountain beverage 1 Table of Contents market which we do not prioritize are low volume beverage customer locations utilizing conventional high pressure cylinders for fountain beverage carbonation. Our newly debuted draught beer beverage solutions target a distinct addressable market of approximately 207,000 U.S. locations serving draught beer, approximately 132,000 of which also represent target fountain beverage locations of high or moderate volume for our bulk CO 2 and Mini-Bulk solutions. The chart below segments the U.S. fountain and draught beer beverage market into our target high and moderate beverage volume fountain and draught beer markets, as defined by number of customer locations at high, moderate or low volume beverage consumption: Restaurant and hospitality fountain and draught beer beverage market total U.S. locations: 625,000 Source: Company estimates OUR SERVICES Our fountain beverage solutionsconsisting of both our bulk CO 2 solutions for high volume locations and our Mini-Bulk solutions for moderate volume locationsare used to carbonate fountain beverages on-site at approximately 132,000 locations nationwide. Our category-leading scale in high volume beverage carbonation solutions and differentiated national service infrastructure allow us to successfully service locations affiliated with 97 of the top 100 national restaurant chains that serve fountain beverages, according to National Restaurant News, as well as the top 10 convenience store chains, according to c-stores.com. We serve the majority of these customers, 56 of the top 100, under longer-term Master Service Agreements, or MSAs. These MSAs generally provide long-term contractual exclusivity for the provision of our services in all corporate-owned customer locations, as well as grant us qualified preferred vendor status for associated chain franchisees. Our MSAs include standardized contractual unit pricing and typically have four to six-year terms of service with each customer location . We believe our national reach, sophisticated bulk service capabilities and demonstrated service record with blue chip customers have contributed to our 58% share of the approximately 210,000 high volume U.S. locations. We estimate that our next largest competitor provides bulk CO 2 solutions to approximately 10,000, or 5%, of these locations. We believe we maintain an outstanding service record with our customers, including McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, Taco Bell, Chipotle 2 Table of Contents Mexican Grill, Panera Bread, 7-Eleven, Regal Cinemas, Walt Disney World and Yankee Stadium, as evidenced by less than 2% voluntary customer attrition over each of our last two fiscal years. In addition, we have no significant customer concentration, as our largest customer contract accounted for less than 3% of total revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. We complement our high volume fountain beverage carbonation solutions with our recently launched Mini-Bulk solution for moderate volume locations, which are typically smaller, less trafficked restaurant and hospitality chain locations or non-chain affiliated individual locations. Mini-Bulk is a "slimmed-down" bulk CO 2 solution, designed to replicate the value proposition and economics of our high volume fountain beverage solutions. Mini-Bulk utilizes a combination of a lower capacity beverage gas storage and dispensing system and more limited gas supply service frequency to target an addressable U.S. market of approximately 85,000 fountain beverage locations. Today, we provide our solutions for less than 10% of these 85,000 locations and, accordingly, we expect that the Mini-Bulk solution will supplement our growth by expanding the potential number of high pressure cylinder users converting to a bulk solution. We have also recently introduced customized draught beer carbonation solutions, including the XactmiX beverage control system and XactN 2 nitrogen generator. These systems are designed to ensure appropriate draught beer carbonation, optimize taste and reduce beer waste from overpour and unused product. We expect the XactmiX beverage control system and XactN 2 nitrogen generator to drive incremental growth from the underpenetrated draught beer carbonation solutions market. We estimate this addressable market includes approximately 207,000 U.S. locations, approximately 132,000 of which also represent target fountain beverage locations of high or moderate volume for our bulk CO 2 and Mini-Bulk solutions. Our high volume bulk CO 2 , Mini-Bulk and draught beer beverage carbonation solutions collectively leverage our dedicated national service infrastructure. As of March 31, 2010, our beverage carbonation service infrastructure consisted of 140 service locations across 48 states, reaching approximately 132,000 customer fountain and draught beer beverage locations using 264 specialized delivery vehicles and 131 technical service vehicles. When we begin servicing a new customer location, our technicians initially install a bulk CO 2 , Mini-Bulk or draught beer beverage carbonation system at a customer's location. The system may include a cryogenic tank for bulk CO 2 , a nitrogen gas generator, a high pressure gas cylinder, and a combination flow control and gas mixing device. We supplement this system with our unprompted delivery and refill services for all supplied beverage gases and any necessary periodic system maintenance, as well as our 24/7 customer service support. The majority of our contracts provide for a single monthly price to the customer for the combination of our beverage system and unprompted, continuous delivery and refill services, with contractual fuel surcharges, annual indexed-based price adjustments and substantial customer termination penalties. Our beverage carbonation solutions incorporate system designs that are developed by us, but manufactured by third-parties on an outsourced basis. We also maintain national beverage grade gas supply arrangements with four major producers, providing for cost-effective and reliable beverage gas supply for our operations. OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS The market leader, with significant barriers to entry We are the market leader in the provision of fountain and draught beer beverage carbonation solutions. We currently manage the nation's sole dedicated and exclusive national service infrastructure and are the only provider capable of delivering a combination beverage carbonation system and gas supply solution on a national scale. We maintain a 58% market share of the approximately 210,000 high volume U.S. locations, and we estimate the next largest competitor provides bulk CO 2 services to approximately 10,000, or 5%, of these locations. As our target customers prioritize quality systems, reliable maintenance and beverage gas supply services at a low monthly cost across multiple locations, 3 Table of Contents we believe our national presence and deep service capabilities would be difficult, costly, uneconomic and time intensive to replicate. Our robust national service infrastructure, service record with blue chip chain customers, and strong local density provide us with differentiated customer reach, allowing us to service national and regional restaurant and hospitality chain customers under long-term agreements, including MSAs. We believe nationally we have a lower relative cost of service given our installed base and resulting scale advantages over our competitors, who are mainly local or regional industrial gas distributors that lack our service capabilities or are not exclusively focused on beverage carbonation solutions. Highly compelling value proposition, yet low dollar cost to our customers Beverage gas remains a critical input in the carbonation of fountain and draught beer beverages, impacting their quality, consistency and taste. Because fountain and draught beer beverages represent the most profitable product in substantially all QSRs, full-service restaurants, bars, and convenience store chains, our beverage carbonation solutions represent a non-discretionary, mission critical purchase by our customers. Despite its importance, beverage gas has a low relative and absolute cost, representing less than one cent of the overall cost of a single fountain or draught beer beverage. Our typical monthly billing to our customers is only approximately one hundred dollars per location. In addition, our customers do not incur any upfront investment associated with our systems. As existing and potential customers come to understand the lost sales and profit forfeiture that results from downtime associated with traditional high pressure cylinder products, as well as the quality, safety and logistical benefits of our beverage carbonation solutions, we believe beverage providers will increasingly choose our solutions at a low-dollar cost for attractive return on their investment. Contractually secure, low volatility revenue base drives visible, recurring cash flows Our revenues remain contractually secure and highly visible, as more than 85% of our approximately 132,000 served locations are under some form of long-term agreement. Further, 70% of our annual revenues are fixed, regardless of volume, with the remainder of our revenue base demonstrating limited volatility on an annual basis. Our typical new customer contracts have an initial term of four to six years, provide us with the ability to pass along certain commodity costs via annual index-based price inflators and monthly fuel surcharges and include significant breakage penalties for early termination. As we typically contract for service with a chain customer's corporate franchisor and its individual franchisee locations, our revenues are also not overly dependent on any individual customer contract or geography. Our largest customer contract represented less than 3% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Because our services represent a critical input to our customers' high margin fountain and draught beer beverage revenues, and because of our integrated system of services, we have not experienced significant customer attrition. Our annual customer attrition rates over the past 2 calendar years have averaged lower than 5% per year, with voluntary customer contract termination representing less than 2% per year. Our historical customer renewal rates over the past 3 calendar years have remained in excess of 95%, demonstrating the strength of our customer value proposition. We have more than offset our customer attrition in each of the past five years with new customer installations derived through newly opened customer locations, conversion of existing high pressure beverage gas cylinder locations and share capture from competing beverage gas solutions providers. We expect this trend of net organic customer growth to continue into the foreseeable future. Predictable and resilient end market demand We believe our end users are both resilient and demonstrate sustained demand in all economic conditions, particularly QSR chains, representing more than 45% of our customer locations and a disproportionately higher percentage of our revenues, and our chain customers (defined as QSRs, full-service restaurants, convenience store and other customers that have 10 or more locations), which 4 Table of Contents collectively represent 80% of our accounts. We believe QSRs will continue to demonstrate predictable demand, given their concentration of visitor frequency with QSR "heavy-users," consisting typically of 18 to 24 year-old male repeating QSR visitors, who represent approximately 20% of the QSR customer base and approximately 60% of the store-level revenues. Further, we believe QSR demand growth continues to be buoyed by the high frequency of QSR visits demonstrated by the Asian-American and Hispanic-American population segments, two of the fastest growing U.S. populations, whose QSR daily visits are two and three times the overall U.S. average. Finally, we believe our chain customers, whose new unit growth and real revenue growth from 2000 to 2005 was greater than three and four times that of non-chain restaurants, will continue to demonstrate strong relative demand, given their comparative advantages of capital, brand awareness, operating prowess and purchasing power. The demand of our chain customers is resilient. For example, during the recessionary period over the past year, as the Consumer Sentiment Index dropped from a 2008 high of 78.4 to a 2009 low of 56.3, U.S. Real GDP contracted 2.4% and U.S. unemployment increased from 5.8% in 2008 to 10.0% in 2009, we increased our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA from $146.8 million and $50.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 to $163.8 million and $62.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, representing 11.6% and 23.9% annual growth, respectively. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see the section entitled "Discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA" below. Master service agreements provide a unique, low risk growth channel We believe our unique service capabilities and dedicated national beverage supply infrastructure have allowed us to secure MSAs with 144 restaurant and convenience store chains that provide fountain beverages, including 56 MSAs with the top 100 U.S. restaurant chains, according to National Restaurant News. These MSAs generally provide for the long-term exclusive provision of beverage carbonation solutions in all corporate-owned customer locations, as well as qualified preferred vendor status for associated chain franchisees, which typically includes standardized contractual unit pricing and four to six year contractual terms of service with each store location. Our MSAs allow us to leverage our corporate franchisor relationships towards the marketing of our services to newly constructed corporate and franchisee locations or current MSA franchisee locations utilizing high pressure beverage gas cylinders. Since MSAs allow us to negotiate terms with a customer on a national or regional level, we are able to avoid the expense and time necessary to demonstrate our capabilities and to negotiate individual contract terms with each customer. We believe MSAs represent an important growth avenue for us, as we currently service approximately 73,600, or 59%, of the approximately 125,800 locations associated with our existing MSAs. Scalable business model with significant operating leverage As the leading national beverage carbonation solutions supplier and only dedicated supplier with national scale, we maintain a dense, highly scalable service infrastructure that we believe gives us a lower relative cost of service and an attractive margin on incremental customers. Our national reach, combined with our local route density, allows us to efficiently service additional customer locations with minimal, if any, incremental infrastructure or personnel costs, while also minimizing the average driver time and wages, mileage and fuel costs incurred between customer stops. We believe that substantially all of the target accounts not currently served by us are on delivery routes currently served by our network. We believe that the incremental margin on new customers acquired in our service network is well in excess of our consolidated margins at our current capacity levels, with minimal need for network expansion in the coming years. As our business continues to grow, we expect our scale and local route density to continue to drive enhanced operating performance, as demonstrated by the expansion of our Adjusted EBITDA margins from 35.7% in fiscal year 2004 to 38.4% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. This operating leverage allows us to target 5 Table of Contents new growth opportunities with similar barriers to entry and competitive advantages, such as our recent Mini-Bulk and draught beer systems, without significant additional investment. Experienced and proven management team We are led by a high quality and experienced executive team. Our senior management team members have an average of approximately 22 years of relevant experience in the industrial gas, restaurant and distribution industries and are responsible for having grown our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA at a compound annual growth rate of 12.3% and 12.8%, respectively, from the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Under the ownership of affiliates of Aurora Capital Group, which acquired our business in 2008, we have deepened management talent at all levels of the organization, adding 14 new individuals to senior and mid-level management positions since the Acquisition. See "Corporate Structure." Eight of these senior and mid-level management positions are newly created positions and did not exist at our predecessor public company prior to the Acquisition. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY We believe the combination of our highly compelling customer value proposition, our leading market position in beverage carbonation solutions and our differentiated service capabilities will allow us to continue to derive significant organic growth through new customer additions from further penetration of our existing markets. We do not expect our growth initiatives to require a significant expansion of our existing service infrastructure or other significant capital investment. Given the depth of our beverage carbonation solutions expertise and the scalability of our service infrastructure, we believe we can continue to drive growth in our revenues through additional market penetration at attractive returns on invested capital without significantly increasing the risk of our operations. We intend to use the free cash flow generated by our business, capacity under our existing revolving credit facilities and a portion of the proceeds from this offering to fund our growth opportunities. Due to the long-term contractual nature of our business, we do not need to commit to the purchase of any components for our systems or incur any installation costs until we have a customer service agreement in place. This provides for an appropriate, timely and highly visible return on each new investment we make. Our growth strategies include: > Further Market Penetration of our Fountain Beverage Solutions. We believe the market for our bulk CO 2 and Mini-Bulk solutions remains underpenetrated. As we currently service approximately 121,000, or 58%, of the approximately 210,000 high volume U.S. fountain beverage locations and approximately 8,000, or 9%, of the approximately 85,000 moderate volume U.S. fountain beverage locations, we believe our leading market position, national reach, compelling value proposition and differentiated service capabilities will allow for increased penetration, resulting in significant new customer additions for our business. We are able to achieve new fountain beverage customer installations through multiple channels, including newly opened customer locations, conversion of existing high pressure beverage gas cylinder locations and share capture from competing beverage gas providers. To accomplish this, we expect to, in part, leverage our MSAs towards the marketing of our services to newly constructed corporate and franchisee locations or current MSA franchisee locations using high pressure beverage gas cylinders. We believe MSAs represent an important growth avenue for us, as we currently service only approximately 73,600, or 59%, of the approximately 125,800 locations associated with our existing MSAs. > Capitalize on Under Serviced Demand with our Mini-Bulk Product Solution. We believe the market for our fountain beverage solutions in moderate consumption locationstypically smaller, less trafficked restaurant and hospitality chain locations or non-chain affiliated restaurantsis 6 Table of Contents large, fragmented and underpenetrated. The U.S. market is comprised of approximately 85,000 moderate volume fountain beverage locations, of which we currently only serve approximately 8,000, or 9%. We have designed our new Mini-Bulk solution to cost effectively address this market opportunity without sacrificing our targeted unit economics or the value proposition to our customers. Mini-Bulk relies on a smaller storage and dispensing system and a reduced gas supply service frequency to substantially reduce our overall cost of service for each Mini-Bulk location. However, once in place, it is serviced using our existing infrastructure. We believe our Mini-Bulk capabilities are a competitive advantage for us, extending our beverage carbonation solutions to underserviced users who cannot be offered a bulk CO 2 solution cost effectively by our competitors. We expect Mini-Bulk to provide an important channel for future new customer growth. > Capitalize on Under Serviced Demand for Draught Beer Carbonation Solutions. We believe the market for draught beer beverage carbonation solutions is also large and underserviced. We estimate the U.S. market consists of approximately 207,000 bars and full-service restaurants operating more than one draught beer tap. We have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary draught beer solutions, including the XactmiX beverage control system and XactN 2 nitrogen generator, to address this market opportunity. Our customizable draught beer solutions now utilize a combination of beverage grade CO 2 , a draught beer grade nitrogen generator and a gas control and blending device to optimize yield, taste and operational efficiency for higher volume draught beer locations. We estimate 132,000, or 64%, of these locations also operate fountain beverage volumes appropriate for our bulk CO 2 or Mini-Bulk fountain beverage solutions. We expect that our new draught beer beverage carbonation solutions will drive significant future new customer account growth from bars and full-service restaurants seeking a cost effective, higher quality beverage carbonation solution. > Acquire Customer Portfolios from Local Distributors. Alternative sources of supply for our services consist predominantly of: > local "mom and pop" gas distributors who cannot offer an integrated equipment system and refill service approach; > regional gas distributors who provide a system and service offering, but lack exclusive focus, competency and cost effectiveness in providing fountain or draught beer beverage solutions; and > large industrial gas distributors that do not possess our service capabilities nor consider beverage gas delivery core to their business model. As the beverage carbonation leader in the U.S. with differentiated service capabilities and the only dedicated national service infrastructure, we believe we have become the "acquiror of choice" for competing beverage gas distributors who find it increasingly difficult to match our cost effectiveness and service intensity. Further, given our dense, nationwide distribution footprint, and the minimal incremental fixed cost and low integration complexity associated with acquired contractual revenues, we are able to acquire incremental revenues at attractive margins. We believe the margins realized on the acquired revenues allow us to significantly enhance our overall operating margins and generate increased equity returns for our stockholders. We have largely operationalized our acquisition program, including dedicating two full-time employees to this function, and have a strong track record of consistently acquiring at least several thousand new accounts from our competitors each year other than in fiscal year 2007. We expect that similar opportunities for account acquisition exist and will remain critical to our growth strategy going forward as well as allow us to achieve enhanced operating margins. > Capitalize on Recovery in our Customers' End Markets. While a difficult U.S. consumer environment slowed customer traffic broadly in 2009 by an average of 2% at QSR locations and an average of 4% at U.S. full-service restaurant locations and consequently slowed the growth of 7 Table of Contents U.S. new restaurant openings, we continued to grow through a mix of organic new account penetration and acquisitions. We believe as unemployment levels subside and GDP grows, store level traffic and new store openings will increase, enhancing our already strong growth opportunity. In addition, QSR consumers continue to shift towards chains versus non-chain locations as shown by traffic distribution. As evidence, the percentage of QSR customers visiting chain locations increased from 62% in 2003 to 68% in 2009. This continuing shift towards QSR chains should benefit our revenues, due to our approximately 80% chain and 20% non-chain customer location mix. > Continue to Pursue Innovative Beverage Carbonation Solutions. We have pioneered the development of beverage carbonation solutions for restaurant and hospitality customers with our introduction of the market's first beverage grade bulk CO 2 solution, through our the most recent innovations, which include the newly debuted Mini-Bulk fountain beverage solution and XactmiX and XactN 2 draught beer solutions. We believe our demonstrated ability to uniquely design, develop and introduce innovative beverage carbonation products and solutions for our customers is a competitive advantage and a critical driver of our leading market position. Further, our innovative solutions not only have supported our market leadership, but continue to expand the size of our target markets and potential customer base, therefore creating new avenues for growth. We expect that we will continue to provide innovative beverage carbonation and related solutions to meet the changing needs and demands of our customers. SUMMARY RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks summarized below, the risks described in the section entitled "Risk factors," and the other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to purchase any shares of our common stock: > the uncertainty of future operating results; > lack of product diversity, continued market acceptance by the fountain beverage market of our bulk CO 2 equipment and consumer preference for carbonated beverages; > the competitiveness of the fountain beverage carbonation market and our inability to respond to various competitive factors; > dependence on our existing leadership team; > failure to find suitable replacements if our current suppliers refuse to or otherwise do not provide services to us; > the pricing and availability of beverage grade CO 2 and other raw materials and shortages or increases in the prices thereof, or an increase in the cost of fuel; > seasonality of fountain beverage consumption; > the business, credit, financial and other risks of customers; > any collateral impact resulting from the ongoing worldwide financial "downturn," including global capital and credit market issues and any impacts on other participants in our industry; and > the impact of our indebtedness on the operation of our business, including the impact of our securitization structure. PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS Aurora Equity Partners III L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Aurora Overseas Equity Partners III, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempt limited partnership, which we refer to collectively as the Aurora 8 Table of Contents Entities, are affiliates of Aurora Capital Group and control the vote with respect to 100% of our common stock, prior to giving effect to this offering. After giving effect to this offering, the Aurora Entities will control the vote with respect to approximately % of our common stock. See "Certain relationships and related party transactionsRelated Party TransactionsSecurityholders agreementProxy and Voting Arrangements." Aurora Capital Group is a Los Angeles-based private investment firm managing over $2.0 billion of total capital. Aurora Equity Partners, the firm's private equity investment vehicle, focuses principally on control-investments in middle-market industrial, manufacturing and selected service oriented businesses, each with a leading position in sustainable niches, a strong cash flow profile and actionable opportunities for both operational and strategic enhancement. CORPORATE STRUCTURE We are a holding corporation that was formed in connection with the acquisition of our business from the prior stockholders of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. by affiliates of Aurora Capital Group in May 2008, which we refer to in this prospectus as the Acquisition. The Acquisition was, in part, financed utilizing a whole-business securitization financing, or the Securitization Transactions, for which we formed limited-purpose Delaware limited liability company subsidiaries, or the Securitization Entities, to house all of our revenue-generating assets as collateral in support of our financing. NuCO 2 Florida Inc., our wholly-owned direct subsidiary, now acts as our operating company and manages the Securitization Entities. We describe the Securitization Entities in further detail later in this prospectus in the section entitled "BusinessCorporate Structure." We believe our whole business securitization financing is a competitive advantage for us as we are afforded unique financial flexibility at minimal risk and a low cost of funding compared to more conventional financing structures. This structure allows us to fund our operations with highly-rated, lower priced debt, while subjecting us to only one financial covenant, a debt service coverage ratio, or DSCR. This structure also has less onerous restrictions on capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and changes of control than typically found in more conventional debt structures. We believe the risk of default in our capital structure is also remote, given that, based on our revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and our balance sheet as of such date, we expect that we would have needed to experience a greater than 34% decline in our collections over the following three months to breach the DSCR covenant. Our unique capital structure also provides us with a flexible maturity. Upon scheduled maturity in 2013 of our Series 2008-1 Class A-1 Notes, or our Senior Notes, and our Series 2008-1 Class B-1 Notes, or our Subordinated Notes, we have two successive one-year renewal periods at our sole option which we can utilize to extend this maturity to 2014 or 2015. COMPANY INFORMATION We maintain our principal executive offices at 2800 SE Market Place, Stuart, Florida 34997 and our telephone number is (772) 221-1754. We maintain a website at www.NuCO2.com.

DISCUSSION OF EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA In addition to our results under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP, we also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP financial measures, which we consider to be important and supplemental measures of our performance. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; Adjusted EBITDA is further adjusted for the non-cash loss on asset disposals and non-cash stock option expenses, and certain non-operating expenses, including sponsor management fees and expenses, securitization debt-related administration fees, and transaction costs related to our acquisition activity. 12 Table of Contents We use, and we believe our investors and other external users of our financial statements benefit from, the presentation of both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance. EBITDA permits the measurement of our operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure, and the method by which assets were acquired. Our management, principal investors and other external users of our financial statements utilize Adjusted EBITDA to further account for non-cash expenses that are unrelated to the core operations of our business, which provides a more appropriate and complete performance benchmark for the business. Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. You are encouraged to evaluate these measures and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: > EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; > EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; > EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; > EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; > EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the non-cash component of employee compensation; > Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; > Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure; and > EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect tax obligations whether current or deferred. Because of these limitations, you should not consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and public disclosures and press releases of non-GAAP financial measures, such as 13 Table of Contents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules require, among other things: > a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and > a statement disclosing the purposes for which our management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: > exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner, from non-GAAP liquidity measures; > adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur; and > presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of any financial information. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, for each of the periods indicated: Predecessor Successor Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income: Fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 Fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 Six months ended December 31, 2008 Six months ended December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 7,639 $ 8,289 $ (894 ) $ (11,976 ) $ (6,021 ) $ (2,940 ) Interest expense, net 2,207 1,863 3,270 36,307 17,997 18,456 Depreciation and amortization 20,059 18,529 2,096 34,734 16,113 16,296 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 6,893 5,380 (522 ) (6,591 ) (3,248 ) (1,441 ) EBITDA 36,798 34,061 3,950 52,474 24,841 30,371 Loss on asset disposal 2,260 2,877 225 2,089 968 1,070 Stock option expenses 4,194 4,361 41 1,105 580 596 Sponsor management fees and expenses   83 1,211 661 558 Debt-related administration fees   15 216 116 86 Acquisition related costs  1,033 88 615 354 51 Adjusted EBITDA $ 43,252 $ 42,332 $ 4,402 $ 57,710 $ 27,520 $ 32,732 14 Table of Contents Risk factors An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing the risks described below, you should also refer to the other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to purchase any shares of our common stock. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY Our future operating results are uncertain despite the previous growth rate in our revenues . Prior growth rates in our revenues should not be considered indicative of future growth rates in our revenues. The timing and amount of future revenues will depend on, among other things: > our ability to renew customer contracts with existing customers upon their expiration and to achieve high customer satisfaction with existing customers; > our ability to obtain agreements with new customers to install bulk CO 2 equipment and use our services; > our ability to increase the density of our customer base for existing service locations in order to allow for increased absorption of fixed costs; > the level of annual increase, if any, in the indices to which the monthly fees and surcharge rates in our customer contracts are tied; > the success of any new products, including our Mini-Bulk CO 2 system and our customized draught beer carbonation solutions, including the XactmiX beverage control system and XactN 2 nitrogen generator; and > our ability to grow our business by identifying and consummating acquisitions. Our operating results will depend on many factors, including: > the level of product and price competition; > our ability to manage revenues, customer turnover and growth; > our ability to hire additional employees; and > our ability to control costs. Although we currently have a contractual backlog, this backlog is not necessarily indicative of future growth rates in our operating results, which will depend in part on our ability to implement new customer contracts. Additionally, such new customer contracts may be subject to modification or termination prior to implementation or may not be implemented for a significant period of time due to customers' prior contractual commitments. If our future operating results suffer as a result of our inability to renew existing customer contracts, obtain new customer contracts, increase the density of our customer base, introduce new and successful products, manage our growth, or for any of the other 15 Table of Contents Risk factors reasons mentioned above, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business lacks product diversity and depends heavily on continued market acceptance by the fountain beverage market of bulk CO 2 equipment and consumer preference for carbonated beverages. Although we are developing new and differentiated products, we depend heavily on continued market acceptance of bulk CO 2 equipment by the fountain beverage market, which has accounted for substantially all of our revenues. Unlike many of our competitors for whom bulk CO 2 is a secondary business, we have no material lines of business other than the leasing of bulk CO 2 equipment and the supply of beverage grade CO 2 . Total demand for bulk CO 2 is limited because the fountain beverage market is mature. While we anticipate future growth from our customized draught beer carbonation solutions and other new products, our current ability to grow is primarily dependent upon the success of our marketing efforts to acquire new customers and the acceptance of bulk CO 2 equipment as a replacement for high pressure cylinders. We cannot be certain that the operating results of our installed base of bulk CO 2 equipment will continue to be favorable and past results may not be indicative of future market acceptance of our services. In addition, any economic downturn experienced by the fountain beverage market or customers or any significant shift in consumer preferences away from carbonated beverages to other types of beverages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Implementing our acquisition strategy involves risk and failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business. One of our key strategies is to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions of bulk CO 2 customer accounts. Acquisitions involve risks, including: > identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or negotiation of acquisitions on favorable terms and valuations; > integrating acquired bulk CO 2 customer accounts; > implementing proper business and accounting controls; > the ability to finance acquisitions, on favorable terms or at all; > the diversion of management attention; > retaining customers after acquisitions; > failing to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; > maintaining our level of customer service as the business continues to grow > increasing incremental depreciation and amortization expense; and > incurring unexpected costs, expenses and liabilities. The growth in the size and scale of our business has placed, and is expected to continue to place, significant demands on our personnel and operating systems. Any additional expansion may further strain management and other resources. Our ability to manage growth effectively will depend on our ability to, among other things, improve our operating systems, expand, train and manage our employee base and develop additional service capacity. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our customer service levels may decline, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain 16 Table of Contents Risk factors our customer base. A failure by us to maintain our customer base could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The beverage carbonation market is highly competitive, and any inability by us to respond to competitive factors may result in a loss of existing customers and a failure to attract new customers. The beverage carbonation market is highly competitive. Our competitors may substantially increase their installed base of bulk CO 2 equipment and expand their service nationwide, provide customer service superior to ours or reduce the price of their services below the prices offered by us. While we believe our national presence and deep service capabilities would be difficult, costly and time-consuming to replicate, we also face the risk of well-capitalized competitors entering our existing or future local or regional markets or developing a new, but competing product. We compete with numerous providers of bulk CO 2 solutions, including: > industrial gas and welding supply companies; > specialty gas companies; > restaurant and grocery supply companies; and > fountain supply companies. These suppliers vary widely in size. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do. Our competitors might succeed in developing technologies, products or services that are superior, less costly or more widely used than those we have developed or are developing, or that would render our technologies or products obsolete or uncompetitive. In addition, competitors may have an advantage over us with customers who prefer dealing with one company that can supply bulk CO 2 solutions as well as fountain syrup. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively with existing or future competitors. Our failure to compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on the continued contributions of our existing leadership team, each of whom would be difficult to replace. Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our leadership team and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel. We have entered into executive employment agreements with our leadership team. The employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, Senior Vice President of Sales and Senior Vice President of Marketing and Business Development expire in May 2013, June 2013, July 2010, May 2013 and June 2014, respectively. However, we face competition for management from other companies and organizations. Therefore, in spite of the existence of employment agreements, we may not be able to retain our existing leadership team or fill new management positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at existing compensation levels. We also do not have "key-person" insurance on the lives of our leadership team or management personnel to mitigate the impact to us that the loss of any of them would cause. Specifically, the loss of any of our leadership team would disrupt our operations and divert the time and attention of the remaining members of our leadership team. Additionally, failure to retain our current management team or to attract and retain highly qualified management personnel to fill vacancies or newly created positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Risk factors As we are dependent on third-party suppliers, we may have difficulty finding suitable replacements to meet our needs if these suppliers cease doing business with us. We do not conduct manufacturing operations and depend, and will continue to depend, on outside parties for the manufacture of bulk CO 2 equipment, beverage control systems, nitrogen generators and components. We intend to significantly expand our base of installed equipment, but our expansion may be limited by the manufacturing capacity of our third-party manufacturers. Manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing needs in a satisfactory and timely manner, particularly if there is an unanticipated increase in demand for bulk CO 2 equipment. We currently purchase bulk CO 2 equipment from Chart Industries, Inc. and Cyl-Tec, Inc., two major manufacturers of bulk CO 2 equipment. Should either manufacturer cease manufacturing bulk CO 2 equipment, or together not be able to meet our supply needs, we may be required to locate additional suppliers. We may be unable to locate alternate manufacturers on a timely basis or negotiate the purchase of bulk CO 2 or other equipment on favorable terms, if at all. A delay in the supply of bulk CO 2 equipment, beverage control systems or nitrogen generators could cause potential customers to delay their decision to purchase our services or to choose not to purchase such services. This would result in delays in or loss of future revenues. In addition, we purchase beverage grade CO 2 for resale to our customers. We maintain beverage grade CO 2 supply arrangements with four suppliers, each of which supplies our requirements for beverage grade CO 2 for contractually-specified locations. In the event any of these suppliers is unable to fulfill our current or, as our business grows, future requirements, and if we cannot make up the difference through one of our other current suppliers, we would have to locate additional suppliers. A delay in locating additional suppliers or our inability to locate additional suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on the pricing and availability of beverage grade CO 2 and other raw material gases and shortages or increases in the prices thereof, or an increase in the cost of fuel, could increase our costs of goods sold, reduce our profits and margins and adversely affect our operations. The principal raw material used in our business is beverage grade CO 2 , which is a commodity product. We purchase beverage grade CO 2 for resale from our suppliers under contracts which provide for annual adjustments in the purchase price for beverage grade CO 2 based upon changes in, among other things, certain indices and the price of beverage grade CO 2 to these suppliers, as applicable. Greenhouse gas emissions have recently been subject to increased scrutiny, public awareness and evolving legislation. Increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on our suppliers of beverage grade CO 2 , which could increase the prices they charge us. Until federal legislation is passed, it is unclear which industries will be impacted by greenhouse gas emission legislation, when they will be affected and whether our suppliers of beverage grade CO 2 will increase the prices that they charge us as a result thereof. In addition, stainless steel is used in the manufacture of most bulk CO 2 equipment, including bulk CO 2 tanks. We purchase bulk CO 2 tanks from manufacturers under certain agreements. Stainless steel prices increased significantly during recent years. Future increases in the price of stainless steel, whether as a result of increases in raw materials, greenhouse gas legislation or otherwise, may result in higher prices for such bulk CO 2 equipment, including bulk CO 2 tanks, which we must purchase. Our business also depends on our ability to deliver beverage grade CO 2 to our customers through specialized bulk CO 2 delivery vehicles. There have been significant increases in fuel costs in recent years. Continued high fuel costs or further increases and our inability to pass on increases to customers could reduce our profits and margins. Increases in the prices of beverage grade CO 2 , bulk 18 Table of Contents Risk factors CO 2 tanks and fuel, including increases that may occur as a result of shortages, duties or other restrictions, could increase the cost of goods sold, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our new products may not be successful. Our newly debuted Mini-Bulk beverage gas systems and XactmiX and XactN 2 custom draught beer carbonation solutions, or any other new products we may launch in the future, may not be accepted by our customers and may not help us to bring in new customers. Any profits we may generate from these or other new products may be lower than in our core bulk CO 2 equipment and service solutions and may not be sufficient for us to recoup our investments in them. New products may also have lower gross margins to the extent they do not fully utilize our existing infrastructure. In addition, new products may present new and difficult technological challenges that may subject us to claims if customers experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. To the extent our new products are not successful, it could damage our reputation, limit growth and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality because consumers tend to drink smaller quantities of carbonated beverages during the winter months. Demand for beverage grade CO 2 in times of cold or inclement weather is lower than at other times. Based on historical data and expected trends, we anticipate that revenues from the delivery of beverage grade CO 2 will be highest in the first fiscal quarter, which lasts from July to September, and lowest in the third fiscal quarter, which lasts from January to March. As a result, we expect quarterly results of operations to continue to experience variability from quarter to quarter in the future. To the extent that we experience greater than anticipated variability from quarter to quarter, it could lead to a disruption in the timing of our cash flows and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Obesity and other health concerns may lead to a tax upon and otherwise reduce demand for some fountain beverages. Consumers, public health officials and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce consumption of certain types of beverages, especially sugar-sweetened beverages, which include some of the fountain beverages in which our carbonation solutions are used. Increasing public concern about these issues and possible new taxes on and governmental regulations related to these beverages may reduce demand for these beverages, which could affect the demand for our products. Any reduction in the demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business and related facilities are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases our cost of doing business. Failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to fines, penalties and injunctions that may adversely affect our operating results. Our business and related facilities are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations adopted for the use, storage and handling of beverage grade CO 2 . The transportation of beverage grade CO 2 is also subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, and our business is subject to 19 Table of Contents Risk factors regulatory and legislative changes that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing services. Our business and facilities are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among these environmental laws are rules by which a current or previous lessee may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property. In addition, these laws typically impose liability regardless of whether the lessee knew, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment site, regardless of whether the affected site is owned, leased or operated by them. As we lease a number of service locations that may store, handle or arrange for the disposal of various hazardous materials, we may incur costs for investigation, removal and remediation, as well as capital costs, associated with compliance with environmental laws. As our business involves hazardous materials such as beverage grade CO 2 , we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that protect the health and safety of our employees and users of our products and services. While we believe that we have sufficient safety procedures in place, beverage grade CO 2 can cause injuries such as frostbite and asphyxiation that may result in, and have in the past resulted in, serious injury or death to employees and other persons. There can be no assurances that our safety procedures will be sufficient to prevent all serious injury or death and such occurrences may subject us to costly fines, damages or other liabilities. Although hazardous material, environmental and safety compliance costs have not been material in the past, these costs, or any similar liabilities that arise in the future, may exceed our resources and we may not be able to completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury. A significant increase in the cost of operations resulting from changing governmental regulations, or fines, damages or other liabilities that may arise as a result of a failure to comply with such regulations, could have a material adverse affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may face risks associated with litigation and claims. From time to time, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. These suits may concern issues including contract disputes, employee-related matters, employee benefits, taxes, environmental, health and safety, personal injury and product liability matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of pending lawsuits and claims, we do not believe that any such matters are material nor that the disposition thereof is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, although the resolution in any reporting period of any matter could have an adverse effect on our operating results for that period. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could negatively impact our business. Our business is subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing and transporting beverage grade CO 2 . We maintain insurance policies in such amounts and with such coverages and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, such insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from 20 Table of Contents Risk factors claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business, and current levels of insurance may not be able to be maintained or available at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Customers are subject to business, credit, financial and other risks that could affect their ability to pay us. Customers may be natural persons or legal entities. Customers are subject to business, credit, financial and other risks. These risks could materially and adversely affect a customer and its ability to make required payments under the applicable customer contracts in full or on a timely basis. Any such decrease in customer contract payments may have a material adverse effect on our business. As a result of financial distress, customers may apply for relief under bankruptcy and other laws relating to creditors' rights in the United States. In addition, customers may be subject to involuntary application of such bankruptcy and other laws. The bankruptcy of a customer could adversely affect our ability to collect payments due under the customer's contract and to protect our rights under, and otherwise realize the value of, such customer contract. This may occur as a result of, among other things, application of the automatic stay, delays and uncertainty in the bankruptcy process and potential rejection of such customer contracts. Our customers inability to pay us, whether as a result of credit issues, bankruptcy or otherwise, could have a material adverse affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If economic conditions in the United States continue to remain weak or deteriorate further, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, and we cannot predict the extent or duration of these trends. During the last few years, economic conditions throughout the United States have been extremely weak and may not improve in the foreseeable future. We are closely monitoring various aspects of the current financial and economic "crisis" and its potential impact on us, our liquidity, our access to capital, our operations and our overall financial condition. We note economic and financial markets are fluid and we cannot ensure that there will not be a material adverse deterioration in our business or liquidity in the near future. No assurances can be given that the current overall downturn in the economy will not have a material adverse affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers. The global capital and credit markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption over the past several years, making it more difficult for companies to access those markets. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, access to capital and credit markets and existing credit will permit us to meet our business needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. Any failure by us or our customers to meet our or their respective liquidity needs could have a material adverse affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 21 Table of Contents Risk factors The current global economic downturn may have other impacts on participants in our industry, which cannot be fully predicted. The full impact of the current global economic downturn on our customers, vendors and other business partners cannot be anticipated. For example, major customers or vendors may have financial challenges unrelated to us that could result in a decrease in their business with us or, in extreme cases, cause them to file for bankruptcy protection. Similarly, parties to contracts may be forced to breach their obligations under those contracts. There can be no assurance that there will not be a bank, insurance company, supplier, customer or other financial partner that is unable to meet its contractual commitments to us. Similarly, stresses and pressures in the industry may result in impacts on our business partners and competitors which could have wide ranging impacts on the future of the industry. Any of these or other issues the participants in our industry may face, many of which cannot be predicted, could have a material adverse affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our indebtedness could adversely affect the operation of our business. As of December 31, 2009, we had total indebtedness of $361.5 million (excluding original issue discount), which includes our Senior Notes, our Subordinated Notes, our Series 2008-1 Class A-2 Variable Funding Senior Notes, which we refer to as our Equipment Revolver, and our Series 2008-1 Class A-3 Variable Funding Senior Notes, which we refer to as our Working Capital Revolver and, collectively with our Senior Notes, Subordinated Notes and Equipment Revolver, our Notes. In addition, provided that we are able to satisfy certain conditions, including rating agency confirmation that a new issuance will meet certain minimum rating requirements and confirmation of the ratings of our outstanding Notes as required by the indenture under which the Notes were issued, or the Securitization Indenture, we will be able to issue unlimited additional series of senior or subordinated notes, which will be secured by substantially all of the assets of the Securitization Entities (other than NuCO 2 Management LLC). Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our business, including the following: > we could have difficulty satisfying our debt obligations, and if we fail to comply with these requirements, an event of default would result, which could lead to, among other things, (i) a reduction in, or elimination of, available cash flow for capital expenditures, acquisitions, expansions of our business and other business opportunities, (ii) an acceleration of all outstanding Notes and (iii) foreclosure and exercise of remedies by the trustee under the Securitization Indenture, or the indenture trustee, against any or all of the assets of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes; > we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness, or, upon the occurrence of certain events, to pay additional amounts of principal and to make deposits in cash trap accounts, thereby reducing or eliminating the amount of the cash flow available to fund additional capital expenditures, acquisitions, expansions of our business and other business opportunities; > we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; > we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or debt that does not have the same restrictions as do the Notes; and > NuCO 2 Florida Inc., our operating subsidiary, may be removed in its capacity as master manager or employee company manager upon certain events of default, and replaced by a master manager or employee company manager that is not capable of managing all or a portion of our business or our employees with the same level of experience and expertise as NuCO 2 Florida Inc. 22 Table of Contents Risk factors If any of these events occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. This, in turn, could negatively affect the market price of our common stock, and we may need to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds that may be realized from those sales, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all. We may not be able to refinance the Notes or may only be able to do so on unfavorable terms. If we are unable to refinance the Notes, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, which could harm our business. Our Notes were issued in the Securitization Transactions under the Securitization Indenture and are currently scheduled to mature on June 25, 2013. The maturity date may be extended for two successive one year periods until June 25, 2015, if we can meet the specified DSCR and no amortization event or event of default under the Securitization Indenture has occurred and is continuing. We may not be able to refinance our outstanding Notes with either a new series of notes or with other forms of indebtedness. Even if we are successful in refinancing our currently outstanding Notes, such refinancing indebtedness may have economic or operational terms that are more onerous than the terms of our currently outstanding Notes. If we are unable to refinance such Notes, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital or seek consent under the Securitization Indenture to sell assets or restructure the terms of such Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in respect of such Notes. If we were unable to repay amounts when due in respect of such Notes, the holders of the Notes could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the Notes. We may be prevented from incurring additional indebtedness, which may adversely affect our ability to fund the growth of our business. Other than a limited amount of capital lease obligations, the only indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the Securitization Entities under the Securitization Indenture consists of additional series of notes. However, before any such additional notes are issued, the Securitization Entities are required to satisfy certain conditions, including the confirmation by Moody's, S&P or Fitch's, as applicable, of specified minimum ratings on the additional notes and confirmation of the applicable rating with respect to each other series of notes outstanding. In addition, the terms of the master manager agreement executed in connection with the Securitization Transactions, or the Master Management Agreement, prohibit NuCO 2 Florida Inc. from incurring indebtedness if it is unable to satisfy a specified interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio, or the master manager incurrence tests. In the event that the Securitization Entities are not able to satisfy any of the conditions to the issuance of additional notes in the Securitization Indenture and NuCO 2 Florida Inc. is not able to satisfy the master manager incurrence tests, the Securitization Entities and NuCO 2 Florida Inc. will not be able to incur additional debt. Moreover, upon the occurrence of an early amortization event (which includes the failure of the Securitization Entities to satisfy a specified DSCR, the occurrence and continuation of an event of default under the Securitization Indenture and the occurrence and continuation of an event of default by NuCO 2 Florida Inc. under the Master Manager Agreement) or a cash trapping event (which consists of the failure of the Securitization Entities to satisfy a specified DSCR), a substantial portion of our cash flow would be used to repay the Notes or be deposited in a cash trapping account, respectively, so the Securitization Entities would not be able to issue new Notes or incur any other 23 Table of Contents Risk factors significant indebtedness at a time when our access to cash from operations would be limited. In addition, the Securitization Indenture prohibits new issuances at any time one of these events is continuing. The inability to incur additional debt may mean that we will not have the ability to finance any additional capital expenditures, acquisitions, expansions of our business and other business opportunities and may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are able to incur debt, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As the consent of the independent manager is required to commence an insolvency proceeding, and given that the Noteholders may remove our senior management team from managing our business upon certain events of default, our ability to negotiate with Noteholders upon an event of default or potential event of default under the Securitization Indenture may be limited. The ability to control the timing of the commencement of an insolvency proceeding, the ability to block the exercise of remedies against collateral by commencing an insolvency proceeding and the ability to maintain control over the operative assets of a business are important factors in the event a company is unable to comply with the terms of its outstanding indebtedness and needs to negotiate a waiver or amendment of the terms of such indebtedness with its creditors. However, as the organizational documents of each of the Securitization Entities provide that the consent of such Securitization Entity's independent manager is required to commence an insolvency proceeding, we would not control whether or when a bankruptcy petition would be filed. In acting or otherwise voting on any such material action, the independent manager considers only the interests of the Securitization Entities, including those entities' creditors, and not our interests or those of our stockholders. In addition, upon the occurrence and during continuation of an event of default under the Securitization Indenture, the Noteholders may remove our senior management team from managing our business. Consequently, if an event of default would occur or has occurred under the Securitization Indenture, the ability of the Company to negotiate with the Noteholders may be more limited than such ability would have been had our indebtedness consisted of a different type of indebtedness such as syndicated bank debt or high yield notes. Extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks, acts of war or extreme weather conditions may cause significant disruption to our business. Terrorist attacks, acts of war or extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, may interrupt our operations and damage our properties, or those of our suppliers and customers. Although we maintain property insurance, such coverage is subject to deductibles, limits on maximum insurance and limits on the types of events that are covered by such insurance and there can be no assurance that we would be able to fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such events. In addition, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Upon the occurrence of extraordinary events including, but not limited to, terrorist attacks, acts of war or extreme weather conditions, there may be a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations, or on the cash flow and results of operations of our customers. The loss or impairment of important intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business relies on certain key intellectual property rights, such as trademark registrations for "NuCO 2 ®," "AccuRoute®" and "Beverage Carbonation Made Easy®," trade secrets associated with our "XactmiX" products, domain name registrations and other confidential and proprietary information. 24 Table of Contents Risk factors A loss of these intellectual property rights, or a decrease in the value or impairment on the use of such intellectual property rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A failure by us to comply with the material terms and conditions of any third-party intellectual property license agreements may give rise to termination of any such license agreement by the third-party licensor. Termination of certain material license agreements, including licenses for software used in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may be required from time to time to take actions to protect, enforce and maintain our intellectual property rights, including by bringing lawsuits against third-parties. We may not be able to adequately maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property rights. Any significant devaluation of such intellectual property rights, including any injury to the goodwill of trademarks included in such intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, from time to time, we may be party to proceedings where third-parties challenge our rights. We may not be successful in such lawsuits, and we may be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third-parties. Such lawsuits could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, and any lawsuits, regardless of their outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our reliance on technology could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computerized information technology, communications systems and software, including the proprietary AccuRoute® system, as well as the technology, systems and software of third-parties. Any failure of current or new technology, systems or software could impair our collection, use, processing or storage of data and the day-to-day management of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our computerized information technology and communications systems and those of third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources. Despite precautions taken by us or our service providers, as applicable, a natural disaster, a cyber attack or other unanticipated problems that lead to outages or the corruption or loss of data at our or their facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The statements regarding our industry, market positions and market share in this prospectus are based on our management's estimates and assumptions. While we believe such statements are reasonable, such statements have not been independently verified. Information contained in this prospectus concerning the beverage grade CO 2 industry, our general expectations concerning this industry and our market positions and other market share data regarding the industry are based on estimates our management prepared using market research sourced from Technomic, Inc., anecdotal data from our customers, results of our operations and management's past experience as well as assumptions made by our management, based on its knowledge of our industry, all of which we believe to be reasonable. These estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to uncertainties and may prove to be inaccurate. In addition, we have not independently verified the information from any third-party source and thus cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness, although management also believes such information to be reasonable. If our estimates and outlook 25 Table of Contents Risk factors concerning the industry, our market positions or our market shares turn out to be incorrect it could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK An active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not develop or be maintained, which could limit your ability to sell shares of our common stock . Prior to the consummation of this offering, there has not been a public market for our common stock since 2008. Although we intend to apply to list our common stock on The New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, an active public market for our shares may not develop or be sustained after this offering. The initial public offering price for our shares will be determined by negotiations between us and representatives of the underwriters, and may not be indicative of the market price at which shares of our common stock will trade after this offering. In particular, we cannot assure you that you will be able to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the initial public offering price. The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline or could subject us to securities class action litigation. Even if a trading market develops, the market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the many risk factors listed in this section and others beyond our control, including: > variations in our quarterly operating results; > our announcement of actual results for a fiscal period that are higher or lower than projected or expected results or our announcement of revenue or earnings guidance that is higher or lower than expected; > sales of our common stock by our principal stockholder; > our dividend policy; > actions by our competitors; > changes in applicable government and environmental regulations; or > general economic and market conditions. Furthermore, the stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline. If the market price of a share of our common stock after this offering does not exceed the initial public offering price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In addition, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. 26 Table of Contents Risk factors If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and other reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us or our business. We do not currently have any and may never obtain research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If no or few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. We are a "controlled company," controlled by the Aurora Entities, whose interest in our business may be different from ours and yours. Immediately after the consummation of this offering, pursuant to proxies and voting agreements, the Aurora Entities will have the right to vote or direct the vote of approximately % (or % if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) of our voting power. See "Certain relationships and related party transactionsRelated Party TransactionsSecurityholders agreementProxy and Voting Arrangements." Consequently, the Aurora Entities will, and will for the foreseeable future continue to, be able to influence or control the election and removal of our directors and our corporate and management policies, including virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval, such as potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, payment of dividends and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may delay or deter possible changes in control of our company, which may reduce the value of your investment. We cannot assure you that the interests of the Aurora Entities will coincide with the interests of our other holders of common stock. See "Certain relationships and related party transactionsRelated Party TransactionsSecurityholders agreement." In addition, because of the equity ownership of the Aurora Entities, we are considered a "controlled company" for the purposes of NYSE listing requirements. As such, we are exempt from the NYSE's corporate governance requirements that our Board of Directors, our Compensation Committee and our Nominating and Governance Committee meet the standard of independence established by those corporate governance requirements. Upon consummation of this offering, we will rely on this exemption, and will not have the full independence required under the NYSE's corporate governance standards for issuers that are not controlled companies. The NYSE independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. It is possible that the interests of the Aurora Entities may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. Substantial future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall. Additional sales of our common stock in the public market after the consummation of this offering, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Upon consummation of this offering, we will have shares of common stock outstanding. The shares of our common stock sold in this offering, as well as any shares disposed of upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, will be freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The remaining shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be available for sale subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated 27 Table of Contents Risk factors thereunder and to the extent applicable, any lock-up agreements that we, our officers, directors, employees and stockholders enter into. As any resale restrictions end, the market price of our common stock could decline if the holders of those shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. In addition, pursuant to certain provisions of our securityholders agreement that will remain in effect after the consummation of this offering, all securityholders who are parties to the securityholders agreement are entitled to certain "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to shares of our common stock, and certain securityholders are entitled to demand registration of their shares. See "Certain relationships and related party transactionsSecurityholders agreement." Registration of any such shares under the Securities Act would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration. As a new investor, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution. Purchasers in this offering will immediately experience substantial dilution in net tangible book value of the shares they purchase. Because our common stock was originally sold at prices substantially lower than the initial public offering price that you will pay, you will suffer immediate dilution of $ per share in net tangible book value. The exercise of outstanding options, 5,856.8 of which are outstanding and exercisable as of April 15, 2010, may result in further dilution. See "Dilution." Since only a portion of the proceeds from this offering will be used to grow our business, the value of your investment in our common stock could be negatively impacted. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to redeem preferred equity, in addition to raising primary proceeds for growth capital. See "Use of proceeds." We do not intend to use all of the proceeds from this offering to grow our business, which could negatively impact the value of your investment in our common stock. Provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents could delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to you. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that we intend to adopt prior to the consummation of this offering may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include: > the absence of cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which means that the holders of a majority of our common stock may elect all of the directors standing for election; > the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting rights or with rights senior to those of our common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock; > the division of our Board of Directors into three separate classes serving staggered three-year terms; > the ability of our stockholders to remove our directors is limited to cause and only by the vote of at least 66 2 / 3 % of the outstanding shares of our common stock; > the prohibition on our stockholders from acting by written consent and calling special meetings; > the requirement that our stockholders provide advance notice when nominating director candidates or proposing business to be considered by the stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders; and 28 Table of Contents Risk factors > the requirement that our stockholders must obtain a 66 2 / 3 % vote to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. See "Description of capital stock." These provisions could also make it more difficult for you and our other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. If we are unable to assess favorably the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls, our stock price could be adversely affected. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, our management will be required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with the attestation process by our independent registered public accounting firm, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation. If we cannot timely and favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence and our stock price could decline. We do not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness do not directly restrict our ability to do so, we do not anticipate paying any dividends to our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our common stock and may lose some or all of the amount of your investment. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. We could incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly-traded company. As a company with publicly-traded securities, we could incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses not presently incurred. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, require us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs. 29 Table of Contents Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements This prospectus includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms "believes," "estimates," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "may," "will" or "should" or, in each case, its negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this prospectus and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although we believe the forward- looking statements contained in this prospectus are reasonable, we caution prospective investors in our common stock that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus. In addition, even if actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. The following list represents some, but not necessarily all, of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from those anticipated or predicted: > the uncertainty of future operating results; > lack of product diversity, continued market acceptance by the fountain beverage market of our bulk CO 2 equipment and consumer preference for carbonated beverages; > failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy; > the competitiveness of the fountain beverage carbonation market and our inability to respond to various competitive factors; > failure to retain our existing leadership team; > failure to find suitable replacements if our current suppliers refuse to or otherwise do not provide services to us; > the pricing and availability of beverage grade CO 2 and other raw materials and shortages or increases in the prices thereof, or an increase in the cost of fuel; > poor performance of our new products; > seasonality of fountain beverage consumption; > reduced demand for some fountain beverages due to increased obesity and other health concerns; > a casualty loss beyond the limits of our insurance coverage; > risks associated with litigation and claims; > failure to comply with governmental regulations governing the beverage grade gases business; > the business, credit, financial and other risks of customers; 30 Table of Contents Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements > any collateral impact resulting from the ongoing worldwide financial "downturn," including global capital and credit market issues and any impacts on other participants in our industry; > extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks, acts of war or extreme weather conditions; > the interests of the Aurora Entities; > loss or impairment of important intellectual property rights; > our reliance on technology; and > the impact of our indebtedness on the operation of our business, including the impact of our securitization structure. These and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements in this prospectus are more fully described in "Risk factors" and elsewhere in this prospectus. We will not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation or undertaking to publicly release the results of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. In addition, it is our general policy not to make any specific projections as to future earnings and we do not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third-parties. 31 Use of proceeds We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses) of approximately $ million ($ million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the mid-point of the offering range indicated on the cover of this prospectus. From the net proceeds to us from this offering we expect to use approximately: > $ million for the aggregate redemption price for all outstanding shares of our Series A preferred stock and our Series B preferred stock, which includes all accrued and unpaid dividends; and > $ million for general corporate purposes, including funding future growth and acquisitions. The fees and expenses of this offering include $ million paid to Aurora Management Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate of Aurora Capital Group, or AMP, in connection with the amendment and restatement of our Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement, or the Management Services Agreement. See "Certain relationships and related party transactionsRelated Party TransactionsManagement services agreement." Certain of our affiliates who hold shares of our preferred stock, as described in greater detail in footnote 1 to the table included in the section entitled "Principal stockholders," will also receive payments in connection with our redemption of all outstanding preferred stock. See "Certain relationships and related party transactionsRelated Party TransactionsRedemption of series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock." 32 Dividend policy During fiscal years 2008 and 2009, and for the six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, we did not declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any dividends to our stockholders for the foreseeable future. However, the agreements governing our indebtedness do not restrict our ability to pay dividends except in the case of an early amortization event or event of default under the Securitization Indenture in which case they do restrict the ability of the Securitization Entities to distribute cash to us. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our common stock and may lose some or all of the amount of your investment. While we intend to re-evaluate this policy as circumstances warrant, any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. 33 Table of Contents Capitalization The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization: > on an actual basis; > on an as adjusted basis to give effect to: > the filing of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which will occur immediately prior to the consummation of this offering, and that will provide for, among other things, the authorization of shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and a for one stock split; > the fee payable pursuant to the amendment of our Management Services Agreement in connection with this offering; > the receipt of net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by us in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us; and > the redemption of our preferred stock, including the accrued and unpaid dividends thereon through , 2010 ( days following the consummation of this offering), the anticipated redemption date, for a total of $ million. This table should be read together with the sections entitled "Use of proceeds," "Selected consolidated financial data," "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. As of December 31, 2009 Actual As adjusted (in thousands, except share and per share data) Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,924 Restricted cash 18,014 Total cash $ 25,938 Indebtedness: 7.25% Fixed Rate Series 2008-1 Senior Note, Class A-1 $ 280,000 9.75% Fixed Rate Series 2008-1 Subordinated Note, Class B-1 75,000 Series 2008-1 Variable Funding Senior Note, Class A-2 6,540 Original issue discount (19,578 ) Total indebtedness 341,962 Redeemable stock and stockholders' equity Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share, 11,000 shares authorized, 10,018.088 shares outstanding 100,181  Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per share, 2,500 shares authorized, 1,965.4 shares outstanding 19,654  Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, 200,000 shares authorized, 119,849.888 shares outstanding 1 Additional paid-in capital 121,576 Accumulated deficit (15,810 ) Total shareholders' equity 105,767 Total capitalization $ 447,729 34 Dilution If you purchase shares of our common stock, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution. Dilution is the amount by which the offering price paid by the purchasers of our common stock to be sold in this offering will exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock after the offering. Net tangible book value per share represents the amount of total tangible assets (total assets less intangible assets) less total liabilities, divided by shares of our common stock outstanding, as of that date. The net tangible book value per share presented below is equal to the amount of our total tangible assets (total assets less intangible assets) less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2009. After giving effect to this offering, our as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31, 2009 would have been $ , or $ per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $ per share to the existing stockholders and an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of $ per share to new investors. The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis: Assumed initial public offering price per share $ Net tangible book value per share at December 31, 2009 $ Increase in net tangible book value per share attributable to new investors $ Adjusted net tangible book value per share $ Dilution per share to new investors $ A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share would increase or decrease our net tangible book value by $ , the net tangible book value per share after the consummation of this offering by $ and the dilution per share to new investors by $ , assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, any increase or decrease in the number of shares that we sell in this offering will increase or decrease our net proceeds by such increase or decrease, as applicable, multiplied by the offering price per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The following table summarizes, on the same as adjusted basis as of December 31, 2009, the total number of shares of common stock purchased from us or, the total consideration paid and the average price per share paid by the existing stockholders and by new investors purchasing shares in this offering: Total shares Total consideration Average price per share Number % Amount % $ $ Existing stockholders % % New Investors Total % % 35 Unaudited pro forma combined financial data The following supplemental unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the combined fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 has been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to the historical audited consolidated financial statements for periods ended July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 (Predecessor) and May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 (Successor) and fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 (Successor) and pro forma period July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008 provided elsewhere in this prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations gives effect to the Acquisition that occurred May 28, 2008 as if it had occurred on July 1, 2007 and includes all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the period July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008. Assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with this unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations is presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations does not purport to represent what our actual combined results of operations would have been had the Acquisition actually occurred on the date indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future combined results of operations. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in "Selected consolidated financial data," "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and the audited combined financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to our unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations. 36 Table of Contents Unaudited pro forma combined financial data Predecessor Successor Pro forma Selected income statement data: Period From July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 Period From May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 Adjustments Combined fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 (unaudited) (in thousands except per share data) Total revenues $ 127,267 $ 12,468 $  $ 139,735 Cost of distribution services, excluding depreciation and amortization 63,440 6,481  69,921 Gross profit, excluding depreciation and amortization 63,827 5,987  69,814 Selling, general and administrative 26,889 1,812 1,123 (1) 29,824 Depreciation and amortization 18,529 2,096 10,468 (2) 31,093 Loss on asset disposal 2,877 225 3,102 Operating income 15,532 1,854 (11,591 ) 5,795 Interest expense, net 1,863 3,270 31,020 (3) 36,153 Income (loss) before income taxes 13,669 (1,416 ) (42,611 ) (30,358 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 5,380 (522 ) (15,911 ) (4) (11,053 ) Net income (loss) 8,289 (894 ) (26,700 ) (19,305 ) Dividends on preferred stock (911 ) (911 ) Net (loss) Income attributable to common shareholders $ 8,289 $ (1,805 ) $ (26,700 ) $ (20,216 ) Net income (loss) per basic common share $ 0.56 $ (18.27 ) $ (195.40 ) Net income (loss) per diluted common share $ 0.55 $ (18.27 ) $ (195.40 ) Weighted average shares outstandingbasic 14,805 98.8 98.8 Weighted average shares outstandingdiluted 15,200 98.8 98.8 See Accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations (1) Represents increase in expenses for sponsor management fees of $0.9 million, trustee fees of $0.1 and replacement management fees and debt related agency fees of $0.1 million incurred as a result of the transaction.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section entitled "Risk factors" for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus. OVERVIEW Our company We are the leading national provider of fountain and draught beverage carbonation solutions to the restaurant and hospitality industry. Our solutions combine equipment for the storage, blending and dispensing of beverage grade CO 2 and N 2 gases, with continuous, unprompted beverage gas supply service to customer locations via long-term agreements. Our equipment, in combination with our gas supply solutions, is designed to ensure uninterrupted fountain and draught beer beverage carbonation for our customers. Our customers are primarily QSRs and also include other restaurant chains, bars, convenience store chains and sports and entertainment venues. Our fountain beverage solutions primarily consist of our bulk CO 2 solutions for high beverage volume locations and our newly-introduced Mini-Bulk solutions for moderate beverage volume locations. We complement our bulk CO 2 and Mini-Bulk fountain beverage solutions with our newly introduced customized draught beer carbonation systems, including the XactmiX beverage control system and XactN 2 nitrogen generator. Revenues Currently, the majority of our revenues are derived from our beverage carbonation solutions for high beverage volume locations. We offer our beverage carbonation solutions through three types of service plans: the Budget Plan, the Equipment Lease and Product Purchase Plan and the Fill Plan. Our Budget Plan customers pay us a flat monthly fee for both the lease of our equipment and our continuous beverage grade CO 2 supply services up to an annual consumption cap, whereas our Equipment Lease and Product Purchase Plan customers pay us a flat monthly equipment lease fee, while purchasing beverage grade CO 2 from us on a per pound supplied basis. Our Fill Plan customers own their own fountain beverage carbonation equipment and purchase beverage grade CO 2 from us on a per pound supplied basis. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, our average annual revenues generated by plan were: Budget Plan 58 % Equipment Lease and Product Purchase Plan 29 % Fill Plan 13 % Our continued revenue growth is largely dependent on our ability to continue to increase the number of served customer locations through organic growth and acquisitions, our ability to increase our prices and the successful penetration of our Mini-Bulk and draught beer beverage carbonation 41 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations solutions. Therefore, we closely monitor customer bookings and attrition for the above referenced plan types. We periodically acquire customer portfolios given our dense nationwide footprint and the minimal incremental fixed cost and low integration complexity associated with acquired contractual revenues. Because these acquisitions typically occur during the course of a fiscal period, our reported revenues for the period may not reflect the impact of all acquired portfolios during the period and may lag in comparison to the reported number of customer locations serviced at period end. Costs of distribution services and selling, general and administrative expense Cost of distribution services, excluding depreciation and amortization, is primarily comprised of purchased beverage grade CO 2 , drivers' and technicians' wages and benefits and vehicle related expenses required to service our customers. Continued gross profit growth is largely dependent on our ability to continue to pass along cost increases for beverage grade CO 2 and other raw materials (which is currently contractually provided for) as well as our ability to continue to minimize our distribution costs, whether by improved productivity, increased customer density or otherwise. Selling, general and administrative expense consist of executive wages and benefits, dispatch and communications costs, as well as expenses associated with marketing, administration, accounting and employee training. Our business model requires the installation of our equipment at each new customer location at the inception of the relationship. We incur considerable depreciation and amortization expenses over the life of each customer relationship stemming from both the depreciation of our gas storage and dispensing equipment and also from the related installation costs and the amortization of sales commissions, deferred financing costs and other intangible assets. An increase in acquired customer portfolios will also increase our depreciation and amortization expenses. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We assess results of operations by monitoring and managing several key metrics pertinent to our business. These include, but are not limited to, total revenues, revenues derived from customer locations, revenues per customer, gross profit percentages, total operating expenses, operating income, and non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. See "Summary consolidated and pro forma combined financial dataDiscussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA." In comparing our historical revenues and costs over prior periods, comparability of some line items are significantly affected by the Acquisition. For instance, depreciation and amortization is higher in more recent periods due to the Acquisition as a result of the increased valuation of depreciable and amortizable tangible and intangible assets. Also, interest expense is shown to increase significantly in recent periods as a result of the Acquisition and its related increase of long-term debt of approximately $355 million. Finally, provisions for income taxes will be similarly affected in periods following the Acquisition due to the higher interest costs that create a taxable loss position for the Company. These affected items are expected to continue at current levels in subsequent periods, excluding any new acquisitions we may make in such future periods. The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the consolidated statements of operations of NuCO 2 Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the table below and throughout this "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," consolidated statements of operations data for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 (Predecessor) and periods from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 (Predecessor) and May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 (Successor) and fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 (Successor) and pro forma combined fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.

Total revenues increased by $7.6 million, or 10.0%, from $76.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008 to $83.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009. The increase in revenues of $7.6 million was driven by $6.3 million of acquisition related growth, $3.7 million of organic revenue growth, partially offset by lowered cost reimbursement of $2.3 million.

The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of total revenues was driven largely by incremental leverage from the addition of acquired customer locations, selling price increases, and raw material cost savings. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $1.3 million, or 9.5%, from $13.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008 to $15.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salary and related expenses due to an increase in administrative headcount and organizational strengthening for the period. Selling, general and administrative expense remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenues at 18.0% for the six months ended December 31, 2008 and 17.9% for the six months ended December 31, 2009. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $0.2 million from $16.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008 to $16.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009. The $0.2 million increase was primarily related to increases in the amortization of intangible assets, such as customer lists, including those acquired in connection with the acquisition of nexAir, LLC in December 2008. As a percentage of total revenues, depreciation and amortization expense decreased from 21.2% for the six months ended December 31, 2008 to 19.5% for the six months ended December 31, 2009. Loss on Asset Disposal. Loss on asset disposal increased slightly from $1.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008 to $1.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009. These costs result primarily from expensing the remaining unamortized portion of deferred lease acquisition costs and initial installations expenses as tanks and related equipment is removed from customer locations we no longer service. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased from $18.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008 to $18.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009. The increase in interest expense was consistent with the Company's average debt outstanding. The effective interest rate of our debt increased slightly from 10.7% for the six months ended December 31, 2008 to 10.8% for the six months ended December 31, 2009. Provision for Income Taxes. During the six months ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, we recognized a tax benefit of $3.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively. However, while we anticipate continuing to recognize a full tax provision in future periods, we expect to pay only alternative minimum tax and state/local taxes until such time that federal net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized. As of June 30, 2009, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $103.4 million and for state income tax purposes in varying amounts, expiring through June 2025. As a result of the Acquisition, our federal net operating loss carry-forwards are subject to an annual limitation. In the future, if we were to undergo another "ownership change" for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our ability to use our pre-ownership change federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (and certain built-in losses, if any) would be subject to an annual usage limitation generally equal to the product of our equity value and the applicable long term tax-exempt rate at the time of the future ownership change which under certain circumstances may prevent us from being able to utilize a portion of such loss carryforwards in future tax periods and may reduce after-tax cash flow. 45 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2009, THE PRO FORMA COMBINED FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2008 AND THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2007 Fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to pro forma combined fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 Total revenues. Total revenues increased by $16.4 million, or 11.7%, from $139.7 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008 to $156.1 million in fiscal year 2009. The increase in revenues of $16.4 million was driven by $6.1 million of acquisition related revenues, $9.9 million from organic revenue growth, and $0.3 million of increased cost pass through.

Cost of distribution services, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $2.4 million, or 3.4%, from $69.9 million for the pro forma combined fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 to $72.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, while decreasing as a percentage of total revenues from 50.0% to 46.3%, respectively. The increase of $2.4 million was primarily related to an increase of $1.9 million in CO 2 costs, due to increased volume to support the increased customer locations, and an increase of $4.9 million in driver's and technician's wages and benefits due to increased headcount hired to support the increased customer locations. These increases were partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in refurbishment expenses, due to a change in accounting policy. Specifically, prior to the Acquisition, we expensed refurbishment costs even though these refurbishments extend the life of the tank. Please see Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by 2.0%, or $0.6 million, from $29.8 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008 to $29.2 million in fiscal year 2009. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 21.3% to 18.7%. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $3.6 million, or 11.6%, from $31.1 million in the pro forma combined fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 to $34.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. As a percentage of total revenues, depreciation and amortization expense increased from 22.3% in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008 to 22.2% in fiscal year 2009. The increase was primarily due to assets acquired in the nexAir acquisition and capital expenditures during the period. Loss on Asset Disposal. Loss on asset disposal decreased from $3.1 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008 to $2.1 million in fiscal year 2009, decreasing as a percentage of total revenues from 2.2% to 1.3%. As previously noted, we expense unamortized deferred lease acquisition costs and 46 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations initial installation costs as tanks and related equipment are removed from customer locations due to customer attrition. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $0.1 million, or 0.3%, from $36.2 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008 to $36.3 million in fiscal year 2009. The increase is not considered significant, as debt levels were nearly identical on a pro forma basis. Provision for Income Taxes. The benefit for income taxes decreased $4.5 million from $11.1 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008, to $6.6 million in fiscal year 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a lower loss before taxes of $11.8 million. In pro forma combined fiscal year 2008, we recorded a loss before taxes of $30.4 million compared to a loss before taxes of $18.6 million for fiscal year 2009. Pro forma combined fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 Total revenues. Total revenues increased $9.6 million, or 7.4%, from $130.1 million in fiscal year 2007 to $139.7 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008. The increase in revenues of $9.6 million was driven primarily from organic growth. Pro forma combined fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 vs. fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 $ Change % Change (in thousands) Organic 8,485 6.5 % Cost pass-through 1,122 0.9 % Total period over period change $ 9,607 7.4 % Cost of Distribution Services, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization. Cost of distribution services increased $7.4 million, or 11.8%, from $62.5 million in fiscal year 2007 to $69.9 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008. As a percentage of sales, cost of distribution services, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased from 48.1% in fiscal year 2007 to 50.0% in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008. The $7.4 million year over year increase was primarily a result of: (i) an increase of $3.4 million in technicians' wages and benefits, due to increased headcount needed to service the increased customer locations, (ii) an increase of $1.6 million in truck expenses, primarily fuel related, as a result of an increase in diesel fuel prices and (iii) an increase of $1.7 million in raw materials, primarily CO 2 , resulting from increase in the average number of customer locations. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 4.6%, or $1.3 million, from $28.5 million for fiscal year 2007 to $29.8 million for pro forma combined fiscal year 2008. As percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expense declined from 21.9% for fiscal year 2007 to 21.3% for pro forma combined fiscal year 2008, primarily as a result of higher sponsor management fees and expenses of $1.1 million. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 54.7%, or $11.0 million, from $20.1 million in fiscal year 2007 to $31.1 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008. This increase was primarily the result of the fair value adjustments to tangible and long lived intangible assets with definite lives resulting from the Acquisition. 47 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Loss on Asset Disposal. Loss on asset disposal increased 34.8%, or $0.8 million, from $2.3 million in fiscal year 2007 to $3.1 million in pro forma combined fiscal year 2008. As previously noted, we expense unamortized deferred lease acquisition costs and initial installation costs as tanks and related equipment are removed or pulled from customer locations due to customer attrition. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 1,545.5%, or $34.0 million, from $2.2 million in fiscal year 2007 to $36.2 million for the pro forma combined fiscal year 2008. The dramatic increase in interest expense resulted from the significant increase in long-term debt due to the Acquisition. Long-term debt increased 854.9%, or $297.5 million, from $34.8 million at June 30, 2007 to $332.3 million at June 30, 2008. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased 260.9%, or $18.0 million, from a $6.9 million provision in fiscal year 2007 to an $11.1 million benefit for pro forma combined fiscal year 2008. The large decrease was a result of the lowered income (loss) before taxes, primarily due to the large increase in interest expense described above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our cash flows were as follows for the periods presented: Predecessor Successor CASH FLOW INFORMATION Fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 May 28, 2009 to June 30, 2008 Fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 Six months ended December 31, 2008 Six months ended December 31, 2009 (unaudited) (in thousands) Operating activities Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 42,774 $ 43,392 $ 5,771 $ 26,118 $ 6,467 $ 13,427 Investing activities Maintenance capital expenditures (3,042 ) (4,593 ) (656 ) (9,314 ) (4,807 ) (5,297 ) Growth capital expenditures (20,394 ) (15,226 ) (1,294 ) (11,643 ) (4,254 ) (7,667 ) Acquisitions   (478,299 ) (44,390 ) (44,398 ) (1,428 ) Other investing cash flows 54 39  8 4 20 Cash flows used in investing activities (23,382 ) (19,780 ) (480,249 ) (65,339 ) (53,455 ) (14,372 ) Financing activities Restricted cash   (19,441 ) 1,655 2,075 (227 ) Debt related proceeds (uses) (708 ) (20,297 ) 298,446 2,696 6,752 (275 ) Equity related proceeds (uses) (18,682 ) (3,614 ) 199,540 40,130 38,810  Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities $ (19,390 ) $ (23,911 ) $ 478,545 $ 44,481 $ 47,637 $ (502 ) 48 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Our cash requirements consist principally of: (i) growth capital expenditures associated with purchasing and placing equipment into service at new customers' sites; (ii) working capital and (iii) payment of interest on indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Securitization Transactions. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we made cash capital expenditures of approximately $14.6 million for internal growth, primarily for purchases of new CO 2 storage and dispensing equipment and the refurbishment of existing CO 2 storage and dispensing equipment for new customers. Generally, when possible, we seek to obtain the use of vehicles, land, buildings and other office and service equipment under operating leases as a means of conserving capital. In addition to capital expenditures related to internal growth, we review opportunities to acquire customer accounts from competitors. On December 31, 2009, the Company acquired customer locations and related equipment of Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers of Indiana, Inc., d/b/a PepsiAmericas-Indianapolis (Indy) region for $0.08 million. On September 30, 2009, the Company acquired customer locations and the beverage carbonation segment of Texas Welders Supply Company for $2.3 million. On August 31, 2009, the Company acquired customer locations and related equipment of Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers, Inc., dba PepsiAmericas (Pepsi) greater St. Louis region for $0.1 million. On December 31, 2008, the Company acquired customer locations and the beverage carbonation segment of nexAir, LLC, an industrial gas distributor in the mid-south region for $42.2 million. Liquidity sources Our principal sources of liquidity are customer collections, unrestricted cash on hand and availability under our two revolving credit facilities: the Equipment Revolver and the Working Capital Revolver. We may borrow up to $30.0 million under the Equipment Revolver on a revolving basis at a rate of one-month Libor plus 4.5%; however, the proceeds of the Equipment Revolver must be utilized to fund the purchase of CO 2 storage equipment, nitrogen generators and other equipment related to our business. In addition, we may borrow up to $20.0 million under the Working Capital Revolver at a rate of one-month Libor plus 4.5% for general business needs at our discretion. As discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, our growth strategy includes a continuous search for acquisition candidates, and, except as set forth above, the terms of our revolving credit facilities do not restrict our ability to utilize borrowing capacity to continue to fund acquisitions. Borrowing Capacity. As of December 31, 2009, we had not drawn on our Working Capital Revolver, leaving $20.0 million of undrawn availability, and we have drawn $6.5 million on our Equipment Revolver, leaving approximately $7.8 million of undrawn availability from unfinanced purchased equipment and unused capacity of $23.5 million. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity from both cash from operations and our revolving credit facilities to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments. One single financial covenant governs compliance for all our debt, including our revolving credit facilities, and requires that we maintain a three-month DSCR of not lower than 1.20. The DSCR is calculated by dividing annual adjusted net cash inflow by annual interest expense. At December 31, 2009 the three-month DSCR was 3.04; based on this calculation, we believe we would have needed to experience a greater than 34% reduction in collections over the following three months to breach this covenant. We continually evaluate our current and alternative financing options and believe we could obtain additional financing on reasonable terms. The terms of any future financing arrangements would depend on, among other things, market conditions and our financial position at that time. 49 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009. Net income plus non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization, provided $18.1 million partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008. Net income plus non-cash items provided $11.9 million, including $19.9 million of depreciation and amortization, partially offset by $3.8 million of deferred tax asset. Furthermore, there was an increase in working capital of $5.4 million primarily driven by accounts payable and accrued interest. Net cash provided by operating activities was $26.1 million for the period from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009. Net loss plus non-cash items provided $27.4 million including $42.5 million of depreciation and amortization, $2.1 million add back of loss on asset disposal and $1.1 million of share-based compensation, partially offset by a $6.9 million change in deferred tax assets. Furthermore, there was an increase in working capital of $1.3 million primarily driven by accrued interest. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.8 million for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008. This was primarily attributable to a $4.1 million decrease in working capital primarily driven by accrued interest and prepaid expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities was $43.4 million for the period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008. Net income plus non-cash items provided $38.3 million including $18.6 million of depreciation and amortization, $5.2 million of deferred tax asset and $4.4 million of share-based compensation. Furthermore, there was a decrease in working capital of $5.1 million primarily driven by accounts payable and accounts receivable. Net cash provided by operating activities was $42.8 million for the period from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007. Net income plus non-cash items provided $41.3 million, including $20.1 million of depreciation and amortization, a $6.6 million deferred tax asset and $4.2 million of share-based compensation. Furthermore, there was a decrease in working capital of $1.5 million primarily driven by accrued payroll. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash used for investing activities was $14.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009. Capital expenditures were $11.9 million and acquisitions represented $2.6 million. Net cash used for investing activities was $53.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008. Acquisitions represented $44.4 million and capital expenditures represented $7.8 million. Net cash used for investing activities was $65.3 million for the period from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009, primarily due to the acquisition of nexAir for $44.4 million and capital expenditures of $18.6 million. Net cash used for investing activities was $480.2 million for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 driven by the acquisition of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. by Aurora. Net cash used for investing activities was $19.8 million for the period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 primarily due to capital expenditures of $17.5 million. Net cash used for investing activities was $23.4 million for the period from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007 primarily due to capital expenditures of $21.1 million. 50 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Cash flows from financing activities Net cash used for financing activities was $0.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009 resulting from payments to the equipment revolver and restricted cash. Net cash provided in financing activities was $47.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008 resulting from the nexAir acquisition and the related issuance of $38.8 million in shares of preferred and common stock proceeds from equipment and working capital revolver of $7.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $44.5 million for the period from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009 driven primarily by the issuance of common stock of $20.0 million and the issuance of preferred stock of $20.0 million and proceeds from our revolvers of $3.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $478.5 million for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 driven by the acquisition of NuCO 2 Inc. by Aurora and related net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $328.3 million and issuance of $199.5 million in shares of preferred and common stock, partially offset by repayment of former credit facility of $25.2 million, restricted cash of $19.4 million and an increase in deferred financing costs of $17.6 million. Net cash used by financing activities was $23.9 million for the period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 driven primarily by the net settlement of the former credit facility of $9.8 million, swaption purchases of $8.5 million and the purchase of treasury stock of $7.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities was $19.4 million for the period from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007 driven primarily by the purchase of treasury stock of $22.5 million, partially offset by a $2.6 million exercise of options and warrants.

While a significant portion of our costs are determined by the price of beverage grade CO 2 , our customer contracts generally provide for annual increases in the monthly service charge based upon various indices published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, while significant 51 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations increases in fuel prices will impact our operating costs, we believe such impact is largely offset by fuel surcharges billed to the majority of our customers. See "BusinessGeneralOur services." As such, we believe that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical accounting policies The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding of our financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with GAAP. Their application places significant importance on management's judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lives of the related leases or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. We have a wide range of estimated useful lives of property and equipment because the useful lives of acquired equipment from various acquisitions are generally less than newly purchased assets acquired in the ordinary course of business. Repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are generally expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of all our respective assets as follows: Estimated life Leased equipment 120 years Equipment and cylinders 120 years Vehicles 15 years Computer equipment and software 15 years Office furniture and fixtures 17 years Leasehold improvements lease term We do not depreciate bulk systems held for installation until the systems are ready for their intended use and leased to customers. Upon installation, the systems, component parts and direct costs associated with the installation are transferred to the leased equipment account. These direct costs are associated with successful placements of such systems with customers under noncancelable contracts, which would not be incurred by us but for a successful placement, and they are amortized over the life of the original customer contract. Upon early service termination, the unamortized portion of direct costs associated with the installation are recognized as a period expense in the consolidated the statements of operations. Such policy is analogous to Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 310, Receivables , related to the accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases. Refurbishment Costs. Our tanks require vacuum refurbishment every seven to ten years to maintain effective operation of the tanks for the expected useful life of the tanks of 20 years. Such refurbishment is considered to be an overhaul to extend the useful life of the assets as compared to a minor maintenance activity. The Predecessor Company previously expensed such costs as a period 52 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expense. In connection with the Acquisition, the Successor Company began capitalizing costs directly related to the refurbishment of existing tanks and is amortizing these costs over the estimated remaining life of the tank at refurbishment, or seven years. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the Company for all transactions accounted for as business combinations. We review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually (at December 31) to assess impairment since this asset is not amortized. Additionally, we review the carrying value of goodwill or any intangible asset whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value. Specifically, we test for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles , or ASC Topic 350. For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired. The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over the asset's implied fair value. Impairments are expensed when incurred. We have not recognized any goodwill impairment to date. Also, under ASC Topic 350, we review, on an annual basis, the carrying value of its other indefinite-lived intangible asset, trade names, for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators are present, then we may perform additional analysis, such as discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals, to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value estimate. Impairment is then measured and the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value is expensed. We have not recognized any impairment for its trade names to date. Other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized on a straight-line method over the periods of expected benefit. Our other finite-lived intangible assets consist of customer lists, proprietary technology and non-competition agreements. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, consist of property and equipment, customer lists, proprietary technology and non-competition agreements. Under FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment , long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment losses are recognized only if the carrying amounts of long-lived assets are deemed to be not recoverable and exceed the asset's fair values. The impairment loss would be calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value of the asset with fair value generally estimated based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows relating thereto. There was no indication of impairment for any periods presented. Recent accounting pronouncements Listed below are recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that may have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These pronouncements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, or ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force . ASU 2009-13 applies to all entities who are vendors that enter into multiple-deliverable arrangements with their customers. ASU 2009-13 provides amendments to the 53 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations criteria in ASC 605 for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements, establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires the relative selling price method in allocating discounts. This update also expands disclosures related to a vendor's multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU 2009-13 will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2009-13 will have on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-05, or ASU 2009-05, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value . ASU 2009-05 applies to all entities that measure liabilities at fair value within the scope of ASC Topic 820. ASU 2009-05 provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques: > A valuation technique that uses: (a) The quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset, and (b) Quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets. > Another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of ASC Topic 820. An example would be an income approach, such as a technique that is based on the amount at the measurement date that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability. > The amendments in ASU 2009-5 also clarify that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. It also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair value measurements. The guidance provided in ASU 2009-5 became effective for us for the six months ended December 31, 2009. However, because we do not currently have any liabilities that are recorded at fair value, the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-04, or ASU 2009-04, Accounting for Redeemable Equity InstrumentsAmendment to Section 480-10-S99 . ASU 2009-04 represents an update to Section 480-10-S99, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, per EITF Topic D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. This update is an SEC staff announcement that provides the SEC staff's views regarding the application of Accounting Series Release No. 268, Presentation in Financial Statements of "Redeemable Preferred Stocks," or ASR 268. ASR 268 requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside permanent equity if they are redeemable (1) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (2) at the option of the holder or (3) upon occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. We have determined that because of certain redemption features included in its Series A and Series B preferred stock issuances are not within our control, such securities should be classified as temporary equity on the accompanying balance sheets. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events, or ASC Topic 855, which modifies current guidance in the auditing literature of the American Institute of 54 Table of Contents Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Certified Public Accountants, or the AICPA, Auditing Standards Section 560, and is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The guidance is largely similar to the current guidance in such auditing literature with some exceptions that are not intended to result in significant changes in practice. ASC Topic 855 applies to all entities that prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. It defines subsequent events either as "recognized" or "non-recognized" subsequent events and refers to events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. ASC Topic 855 requires entities to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. We previously adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 855 and evaluated the impact of material subsequent events that have occurred through the date at which the accompanying consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. No recognized or non-recognized subsequent events were identified requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2009 other than those disclosed in the Subsequent Events note. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not use financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk. Our primary market risk exposures are changes in interest rates and in beverage grade CO 2 and fuel prices. Interest rate risk and debt sensitivity analysis At June 30, 2009, we had fixed-rate debt of $355.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of 7.8% and variable revolving debt of $6.5 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%. Holding debt levels constant, a one-percentage point decrease in market interest rates based on estimated rates for similar types of arrangements would increase the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately $10.3 million and increase the cash flow from the variable debt by approximately $0.1 million. A one-percentage point increase in such interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt by approximate $9.9 million and decrease the cash flow from the variable debt by approximate $0.1 million. Commodity price risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk related to our purchase of beverage grade CO 2 , the primary commodity upon which our business depends. While beverage grade CO 2 is typically available in sufficient supply, the price of beverage grade CO 2 is subject to fluctuation. We do not use any derivative or hedging instruments to manage the price risk. While our beverage grade CO 2 requirements contracts on the supply side provide for annual adjustments in the purchase price for beverage grade CO 2, if the price of beverage grade CO 2 increases, our variable costs could also increase. While historically we have successfully mitigated these increased costs through our customer contracts, which generally provide for annual increases in the monthly revenues based on increases in various indices published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we may not be able to successfully mitigate these costs in future contracts, which could cause our gross margins to decline. See "Risk factors." Our business relies heavily on the delivery of our products directly to the customers' store locations. Therefore fuel costs are a major expense for us. If worldwide prices for oil, and in turn, truck fuel, increase, our financial performance may be negatively affected. Although historically we have been successful in mitigating these cost increases through a fuel surcharge assessed to the customer, in the future, we may not be able to fully recover these costs and our gross margins could decline. See "Risk factors." 55 Table of Contents Business GENERAL Our company We are the leading national provider of fountain and draught beer beverage carbonation solutions to the restaurant and hospitality industry. Our solutions combine equipment for the storage, blending, and dispensing of beverage grade CO 2 and N 2 gases, with continuous, unprompted beverage gas supply service to customer locations via long-term agreements. In combination, our equipment and beverage gas supply services are designed to ensure uninterrupted fountain and draught beer beverage carbonation for our customers. Our customers are primarily QSRs as well as other restaurant chains, bars, convenience store chains, and sports and entertainment venues. Our solutions maximize our customers' cost effectiveness, operational efficiency and carbonation supply reliability by replacing costly, more cumbersome and less reliable high pressure beverage gas cylinders, at a small monthly cost with no upfront investment for the customer. We believe our value proposition remains strong and durable, as beverage carbonation is critically important to our QSR and other customers, who derive the largest portion of store level profitability from high-margin fountain and draught beer beverage revenues. As a result, we have a highly visible revenue base supported by long-term service agreements with high renewal rates and a significant national presence with substantial barriers to entry. We believe we have strong growth potential, as our solutions remain underpenetrated in our target markets despite our current leading market share position. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we generated revenues of $163.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $62.9 million. Our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA grew at a compound annual growth rate of 12.3% and 12.8%, respectively, from the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see the section entitled "Summary consolidated and pro forma combined financial dataDiscussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA." Our markets We serve the U.S. fountain and draught beer retail beverage market, which consists of an aggregate of approximately 625,000 restaurant and hospitality locations nationwide. Our fountain beverage bulk CO 2 solutions, which currently represent a majority of our revenues, are customized to individually serve both high beverage volume and moderate beverage volume customer locations, as defined by estimated annual soda syrup consumption per fountain location, which we believe is a proxy for store-level beverage gas consumption. Our newly-introduced Mini-Bulk solutions are designed for moderate volume locations. We consider those locations that use more than 500 gallons of fountain syrup per year to be high volume, those locations that use between 300 and 500 gallons of fountain syrup per year to be moderate volume and those locations that use less than 300 gallons of fountain syrup per year to be low volume. We estimate that there are approximately 210,000 U.S. locations in the addressable market for our high volume fountain beverage solutions, of which we currently service approximately 121,000 locations, or 58%. We also estimate the moderate volume market opportunity is approximately 85,000 locations in the U.S., of which we currently service approximately 8,000 locations, or 9%. The remaining approximately 330,000 locations in the U.S. retail fountain beverage market which we do not prioritize are low volume beverage customer locations utilizing conventional high pressure cylinders for fountain beverage carbonation. Our newly debuted draught beer beverage solutions target a distinct addressable market of approximately 207,000 U.S. locations serving draught beer, approximately 132,000 of which also represent target fountain beverage locations of high or moderate volume for our bulk CO 2 and Mini-Bulk solutions. 56 Table of Contents Business The chart below segments the U.S. fountain and draught beer beverage market into our target high and moderate beverage volume fountain and draught beer markets, as defined by number of customer locations at high, moderate or low volume beverage consumption: Restaurant and hospitality fountain and draught beer beverage market total U.S. locations: 625,000 Source: Company estimates Our services Our fountain beverage solutionsconsisting of both our bulk CO 2 solutions for high volume locations and our newly-introduced Mini-Bulk solutions for moderate volume locationsare used to carbonate fountain beverages on-site at approximately 132,000 locations nationwide. Our category-leading scale in high volume beverage carbonation solutions and differentiated national service infrastructure allow us to successfully service locations affiliated with 97 of the top 100 national restaurant chains that serve fountain beverages according to National Restaurant News, as well as the top 10 convenience store chains, according to c-stores.com. We serve the majority of these customers, 56 of the top 100, under longer-term MSAs. These MSAs generally provide long-term contractual exclusivity for the provision of our services in all corporate-owned customer locations, as well as grant us qualified preferred vendor status for associated chain franchisees. Our MSAs include standardized contractual unit pricing and typically have four to six-year terms of service with each customer location . We believe our national reach, sophisticated bulk service capabilities and demonstrated service record with blue chip customers have contributed to our 58% share of the approximately 210,000 high volume U.S. locations. We estimate that our next largest competitor provides bulk CO 2 solutions to approximately 10,000, or 5%, of these locations. We believe we maintain an outstanding service record with our customers, including McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, Taco Bell, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Panera Bread, 7-Eleven, Regal Cinemas, Walt Disney World and Yankee Stadium, as evidenced by less than 2% voluntary customer attrition over each of our last two fiscal years. In addition, we have no significant customer concentration, as our largest customer contract accounted for less than 3% of total revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. 57 Table of Contents Business We complement our high volume fountain beverage carbonation solutions with our recently launched Mini-Bulk solution for moderate volume locations, which are typically smaller, less trafficked restaurant and hospitality chain locations or non-chain affiliated individual locations. Mini-Bulk is a "slimmed-down" bulk CO 2 solution, designed to replicate the value proposition and economics of our high volume fountain beverage solutions. Mini-Bulk utilizes a combination of a lower capacity beverage gas storage and dispensing system and more limited gas supply service frequency to target an addressable U.S. market of approximately 85,000 fountain beverage locations. Today, we provide our solutions for less than 10% of these 85,000 locations and, accordingly, we expect that the Mini-Bulk solution will supplement our growth by expanding the potential number of high pressure cylinder users converting to a bulk solution. We have also recently introduced customized draught beer carbonation solutions, including the XactmiX beverage control system and XactN 2 nitrogen generator. These systems are designed to ensure appropriate draught beer carbonation, optimize taste and reduce beer waste from overpour and unused product. We expect the XactmiX beverage control system and XactN 2 nitrogen generator to drive incremental growth from the underpenetrated draught beer carbonation solutions market. We estimate this addressable market includes approximately 207,000 U.S. locations, approximately 132,000 of which also represent target fountain beverage locations of high or moderate volume for our bulk CO 2 and Mini-Bulk solutions. Our high volume bulk CO 2 , Mini-Bulk and draught beer beverage carbonation solutions collectively leverage our dedicated national service infrastructure. As of March 31, 2010, our beverage carbonation service infrastructure consisted of 140 service locations across 48 states, reaching approximately 132,000 customer fountain and draught beer beverage locations using 264 specialized delivery vehicles and 131 technical service vehicles. When we begin servicing a new customer location, our technicians initially install a bulk CO 2 , Mini-Bulk or draught beer beverage carbonation system at a customer's location. The system may include a cryogenic tank for bulk CO 2 , a nitrogen gas generator, a high pressure gas cylinder, and a combination flow control and gas mixing device. We supplement this system with our unprompted delivery and refill services for all supplied beverage gases and any necessary periodic system maintenance, as well as our 24/7 customer service support. The majority of our contracts provide for a single monthly price to the customer for the combination of our beverage system and unprompted, continuous delivery and refill services, with contractual fuel surcharges, annual indexed-based price adjustments and substantial customer termination penalties. Our beverage carbonation solutions incorporate system designs that are developed by us, but manufactured by third-parties on an outsourced basis. We also maintain national beverage grade gas supply arrangements with four major producers, providing for cost-effective and reliable beverage gas supply for our operations. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY We believe the combination of our highly compelling customer value proposition, our leading market position in beverage carbonation solutions and our differentiated service capabilities will allow us to continue to derive significant organic growth through new customer additions from further penetration of our existing markets. We do not expect our growth initiatives to require a significant expansion of our existing service infrastructure or other significant capital investment. Given the depth of our beverage carbonation solutions expertise and the scalability of our service infrastructure, we believe we can continue to drive growth in our revenues through additional market penetration at attractive returns on invested capital without significantly increasing the risk of our operations. We intend to use the free cash flow generated by our business, capacity under our existing revolving credit facilities and a portion of the proceeds from this offering to fund our growth opportunities. Due 58 Table of Contents Business to the long-term contractual nature of our business, we do not need to commit to the purchase of any components for our systems or incur any installation costs until we have a customer service agreement in place. This provides for an appropriate, timely and highly visible return on each new investment we make. Further market penetration of our fountain beverage solutions We believe the market for our bulk CO 2 and Mini-Bulk solutions remains underpenetrated. As we currently service approximately 121,000, or 58%, of the 210,000 high volume U.S. fountain beverage locations and approximately 8,000, or 9%, of the approximately 85,000 moderate volume U.S. fountain beverage locations, we believe our leading market position, national reach, compelling value proposition and differentiated service capabilities will allow for increased penetration, resulting in significant new customer additions for our business. We are able to achieve new fountain beverage customer installations through multiple channels, including newly opened customer locations, conversion of existing high pressure beverage gas cylinder locations and share capture from competing beverage gas providers. To accomplish this, we expect to, in part, leverage our MSAs towards the marketing of our services to newly constructed corporate and franchisee locations or current MSA franchisee locations using high pressure beverage gas cylinders. We believe MSAs represent an important growth avenue for us, as we currently service approximately 73,600, or 59%, of the approximately 125,800 locations associated with our existing MSAs. Capitalize on under-serviced demand with our "Mini-Bulk" product solution We believe the market for our fountain beverage solutions in moderate consumption locationstypically smaller, less trafficked restaurant and hospitality chain locations or non-chain affiliated restaurantsis large, fragmented and underpenetrated. The U.S. market is comprised of approximately 85,000 moderate volume fountain beverage locations, of which we currently only serve approximately 8,000, or 9%. We have designed our new Mini-Bulk solution to cost effectively address this market opportunity without sacrificing our targeted unit economics or the value proposition to our customers. Mini-Bulk relies on a smaller storage and dispensing system and a reduced gas supply service frequency to substantially reduce our overall cost of service for each Mini-Bulk location. However, once in place, it is serviced using our existing infrastructure. We believe our Mini-Bulk capabilities are a competitive advantage for us, extending our beverage carbonation solutions to underserviced users who cannot be offered a bulk CO 2 solution cost effectively by our competitors. We expect Mini-Bulk to provide an important channel for future new customer growth. Capitalize on under-serviced demand for draught beer carbonation solutions We believe the market for draught beer beverage carbonation solutions is also large and underserviced. We estimate the U.S. market consists of approximately 207,000 bars and full-service restaurants operating more than one draught beer tap. We have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary draught beer solutions, including the XactmiX beverage control system and XactN 2 nitrogen generator, to address this market opportunity. Our customizable draught beer solutions now utilize a combination of beverage grade CO 2 , a draught beer grade nitrogen generator and a gas control and blending device to optimize yield, taste and operational efficiency for higher volume draught beer locations. We estimate 132,000, or 64%, of these locations also operate fountain beverage volumes appropriate for our bulk CO 2 or Mini-Bulk fountain beverage solutions. We expect that our new draught beer beverage carbonation solutions will drive significant future new customer account growth from bars and full-service restaurants seeking a cost effective, higher quality beverage carbonation solution. 59 Table of Contents Business Acquire customer portfolios from local distributors Alternative sources of supply for our services consist predominantly of: > local "mom and pop" gas distributors who cannot offer an integrated equipment system and refill service approach; > regional gas distributors who provide a system and service offering, but lack exclusive focus, competency and cost effectiveness in providing fountain or draught beer beverage solutions; and > large industrial gas distributors that do not possess our service capabilities nor consider beverage gas delivery core to their business model. As the beverage carbonation leader in the U.S. with differentiated service capabilities and the only dedicated national service infrastructure, we believe we have become the "acquiror of choice" for competing beverage gas distributors who find it increasingly difficult to match our cost effectiveness and service intensity. Further, given our dense, nationwide distribution footprint, and the minimal incremental fixed cost and low integration complexity associated with acquired contractual revenues, we are able to acquire incremental revenues at attractive margins. We believe the margins realized on the acquired revenues allow us to significantly enhance our overall operating margins and generate increased equity returns for our stockholders. We have largely operationalized our acquisition program, including dedicating two full-time employees to this function, and have a strong track record of consistently acquiring at least several thousand new accounts from our competitors each year other than in fiscal year 2007. We expect that similar opportunities for account acquisition exist and will remain critical to our growth strategy going forward as well as allow us to achieve enhanced operating margins. Capitalize on recovery in our customers' end markets While a difficult U.S. consumer environment slowed customer traffic broadly in 2009 by an average of 2% at QSR locations and an average of 4% at U.S. full-service restaurant locations and consequently slowed the growth of new U.S. restaurant openings, we continued to grow through a mix of organic new account penetration and acquisitions. We believe as unemployment levels subside and GDP grows, store level traffic and new store openings will increase, enhancing our already strong growth opportunity. In addition, QSR consumers continue to shift towards chains versus non-chain locations as shown by traffic distribution. As evidence, the percentage of QSR customers visiting chain locations increased from 62% in 2003 to 68% in 2009. This continuing shift towards QSR chains should benefit our revenues, due to our approximately 80% chain and 20% non-chain customer location mix. Continue to pursue innovative beverage carbonation solutions We have pioneered the development of beverage carbonation solutions for restaurant and hospitality customers with our introduction of the market's first beverage grade bulk CO 2 solution, through our the most recent innovations, which include the newly debuted Mini-Bulk fountain beverage solution and XactmiX and XactN 2 draught beer solutions. We believe our demonstrated ability to uniquely design, develop and introduce innovative beverage carbonation products and solutions for our customers is a competitive advantage and a critical driver of our leading market position. Further, our innovative solutions not only have supported our market leadership, but continue to expand the size of our target markets and potential customer base, therefore creating new avenues for growth. We expect that we will continue to provide innovative beverage carbonation and related solutions to meet the changing needs and demands of our customers. 60 Table of Contents Business OPERATIONS Services Upon activation of a customer account, our technicians design the customer's beverage carbonation solution and install the appropriate tank and piping equipment. In most instances, the equipment at a customer's site is accessible from the outside of the customer's establishment, so that the delivery of beverage grade CO 2 does not cause any interference with the operations of the customer. We place a locking device on the fill port to reduce the likelihood of tampering and to prevent customers from using alternative sources of CO 2 while under contract with us. We maintain a highly efficient delivery route structure and have established 140 service locations across the continental United States. Our goal is to have a service location centrally located within 75 miles of each customer we serve. We actively manage our delivery routes to maximize route density. Greater route density lowers the average time and distance traveled between stops, thereby lowering the average cost per delivery and optimizing fixed cost absorption. We have developed an automated system to achieve maximum route optimization. In order to ensure reliability and consistent service levels to the customer, CO 2 deliveries are made at fixed intervals. Information from our propriety AccuRoute® system is used to determine the proper delivery frequency. Each location's delivery schedule is developed based upon delivery history, seasonality and promotions reported to us by the customer. The scheduling system analyzes a customer's CO 2 usage (as determined by flow meters installed on our specialized delivery vehicles) to determine the planned delivery frequency. The foundation of our scheduling system is the delivery information gathered by the portable account link, or the "PAL System." The PAL System utilizes a hand-held device to provide field personnel with up to date delivery route and customer account information and also serves as an input source record for all delivery and service transaction information. The scheduling system further utilizes sophisticated computer algorithms that consider: > latitudinal and longitudinal map location of the account; > optimal driving directions to reduce drive time; > safety stock margins; > truck capacity; > manpower capacity; and > any special delivery requirements. The software program is designed to create an optimal route to service the customer using all the above information. The system also allows both local and senior management the ability to review performance of the routing program. Our beverage carbonation solutions are backed by extensive customer service and support. Our drivers and technicians are trained to fix minor technical problems with our equipment and to educate customers on how each system works. We operate a customer service call center 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our in-house customer service representatives provide access to experienced technical personnel who are able to answer customer queries, identify problems and dispatch service personnel as required. In addition, our in-house technical expertise in maintaining and refurbishing bulk CO 2 tanks adds to our knowledge and understanding of our systems. As a result of this expertise, we have a sufficient supply of bulk CO 2 tanks and related equipment readily available for our customers' use and are able to minimize service interruptions and downtime for system maintenance. 61 Table of Contents Business Service plans The majority of our revenues are generated from our bulk CO 2 service plans for high beverage volume locations. We generally offer our services pursuant to customer contracts that primarily relate to one of three types of service plans: (i) the Budget Plan, (ii) the Equipment Lease and Product Purchase Plan and (iii) the Fill Plan. The following table provides a break down of our revenues by service plan for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Set forth below is a brief summary of the current terms of each service plan. Service plan % of fiscal year 2009 service plan revenues Budget Plan 58 % Equipment Lease and Product Purchase Plan 29 % Fill Plan 13 % Budget Plan. Pursuant to a customer contract under the Budget Plan, or a Budget Plan Contract, a customer pays a flat monthly fee for (i) the lease, installation and maintenance of a beverage carbonation system and (ii) refills of CO 2 up to a predetermined annual volume, or the Yearly Supply. To the extent the customer's CO 2 usage exceeds the Yearly Supply, the customer is charged for additional delivered CO 2 on a per pound basis, or the Overage Rate. Customers are also generally responsible for all applicable taxes, fees (including any hazardous materials handling charges), assessments, an energy delivery surcharge and a delivery surcharge. To the extent that a Budget Plan Contract relates to multiple customer locations, the Yearly Supply is generally multiplied by the number of customer locations, or the Blanketed Amount. CO 2 is not charged at the Overage Rate until the Blanketed Amount has been exceeded over a 12 month period. The monthly fee and Overage Rate for each customer location is determined at the time the related Budget Plan Contract is signed by the customer for such customer location. On each anniversary of the commencement of a Budget Plan Contract, typically the monthly fee and Overage Rate are increased by an amount equal to the percentage change in the index specified in the related customer contract (usually the Consumer Price Index, or the CPI). The current form Budget Plan Contracts are for terms of six years and automatically renew for successive six year terms. Equipment Lease and Product Purchase Plan. Pursuant to a customer contract under the Equipment Lease and Product Purchase Plan, or an ELPPP Contract, a customer pays (i) a monthly fee for the lease, installation and maintenance of a beverage carbonation system and (ii) for the delivery of CO 2 on a per pound basis, or the Product Rate. Customers are also generally responsible for all applicable taxes, fees (including any hazardous materials handling charges), assessments, an energy delivery surcharge and a delivery surcharge. An ELPPP Contract may relate to multiple customer locations. The monthly fee and Product Rate for each customer location is determined at the time the related contract is signed by the customer for such customer location. On each anniversary of the commencement of an ELPPP Contract, typically the monthly fee and Product Rate are increased by an amount equal to the percentage change in the index specified in the related customer contract (usually the CPI). The current form ELPPP Contracts are for terms of six years and automatically renew for successive six year terms. 62 Table of Contents Business Fill Plan. Pursuant to a customer contract under the Fill Plan, or a Fill Plan Contract, a customer pays for refills of CO 2 at a specified Product Rate or a monthly fee. Customers are also generally responsible for all applicable taxes, fees (including any hazardous materials handling charges), assessments, an energy delivery surcharge and a delivery surcharge. A Fill Plan Contract may relate to multiple customer locations. The Product Rate for each customer location is determined at the time of the related Fill Plan Contract is signed by the customer for such customer location. On each anniversary of the commencement of a Fill Plan Contract, typically the Product Rate or the monthly fee is increased by an amount equal to the percentage change in the index specified in the related customer contract (usually the CPI). The current form Fill Plan Contracts are for terms of six years and automatically renew for successive six year terms. MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENTS We have entered into MSAs with 144 restaurant and convenience store concepts that provide fountain beverages. These MSAs generally (i) provide for a long-term commitment on the part of the customer for all of its corporate-owned customer locations and may also include future locations and (ii) positions us as a preferred vendor with associated franchisees. We currently service approximately 73,600 corporate and franchisee locations with chains that have signed MSAs. We are actively working to expanding the number of MSAs with restaurant chains. 63 Table of Contents Business CUSTOMERS Among our current customers are many of the major national and regional restaurant and convenience store chains (based on U.S. system wide foodservice sales), movie theater operators, theme parks, resorts and sports venues, including: Quick Serve Restaurants Casual/Dinner Houses Arby's KFC Applebee's Longhorn Steakhouse Boston Market Krystal's Bob Evans Outback Steakhouse Buffalo Wild Wings Long John Silvers Carrabba's Perkins Family Restaurants Burger King McDonald's Chili's Red Robin Captain D's Panda Express Chuck E Cheese Red Lobster/Olive Garden Carl's Jr. Panera Bread Company CiCi's Pizza Romano's Macaroni Grill Checker's / Rally's Pizza Hut Cracker Barrel Ruby Tuesday Chipotle Grill Qdoba Friendly's Restaurant Ryan's Family Steak House Church's Chicken Sbarro Golden Corral Shoney's Dairy Queen Sonic Drive-In Hooters Sizzler El Pollo Loco Steak'n Shake Landry's Einstein Bagels Subway Hardee's Taco Bell Five Guys Burgers & Fries Waffle House Huddle House Wendy's Jack in the Box Zaxby's Contract Feeders Retailers Convenience/Petroleum ARAmark BJ's Wholesale 7-Eleven Mapco Marts Compass Group Costco BP/Amoco RaceTrac Petroleum Delaware North Companies Meijer Circle K Speedway HMSHost Sam's Club ExxonMobil Sunoco A+ Target Hess Marts Tom Thumb Sports Venues Movie Theatres AMF Bowling Centers Paul Brown Stadium AMC Theatres Landmark Theatres Arrowhead Stadium Sun Life Stadium Carmike Cinemas Regal Entertainment Citi Field Verizon Center Cinemark Theatres Showcase Theatres Georgia Dome Yankee Stadium Madison Square Garden Theme/Amusement Six Flags Walt Disney World Universal Studios Florida COMPETITION We compete primarily against local or regional distributors of industrial gases, diversified fountain supply companies and restaurant supply companies. These companies generally provide a number of products and services in addition to beverage gas supply and often view beverage carbonation services as a high service adjunct to their core business. While many of our competitors lack the capital necessary to offer complete beverage carbonation systems to customers on lease or do not possess the service capabilities to support both equipment and recurring beverage supply on a national scale, competing suppliers vary widely in size and capabilities. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical or marketing resources. We believe that our ability to compete will depend on a number of factors, including beverage gas quality, availability and reliability, price, name recognition, delivery time and service, and scale and 64 Table of Contents Business customer reach. Despite the customer-level advantages of our beverage carbonation solutions relative to high pressure cylinders, we generally price our services comparably to the price of high pressure cylinders. This has proved an effective inducement to cause customers to convert from high pressure cylinders to one of our beverage carbonation systems, given the heightened convenience and predictability of supply that our solutions provide. We are the only beverage carbonation solution provider with nationwide service and distribution capabilities and believe that other qualified suppliers of beverage carbonation systems and solutions do not presently exist in many regions of the United States. Unlike many of our competitors for whom beverage carbonation is a secondary service line, we have no material lines of business other than the provision of beverage carbonation solutions. All aspects of our operations are guided by our focus on the beverage carbonation business, including our selection of operating equipment and technical personnel, design of delivery routes, location of service locations, structure of customer contracts, content of employee training programs and design of management information and accounting systems. By restricting the scope of our activities to the beverage carbonation market and largely avoiding the dilution of management time and resources that would be required by other service lines, we believe that we are able to maximize the level of service provided to our customers. Further, we believe that we enjoy advantages over competitors due to our hub and spoke delivery system, overall route density and lower average time and distance traveled between stops, in addition to our customer service capabilities. Competitive strengths The Market Leader, with Significant Barriers to Entry. We are the market leader in the provision of fountain and draught beer beverage carbonation solutions. We currently manage the nation's sole dedicated and exclusive national service infrastructure and are the only provider capable of delivering a combination beverage carbonation system and gas supply solution on a national scale. We maintain a 58% market share of the approximately 210,000 high volume U.S. locations, and we estimate the next largest competitor provides bulk CO 2 services to 5% of these locations. As our target customers prioritize quality systems, reliable maintenance and beverage gas supply services at a low monthly cost across multiple locations, we believe our national presence and deep service capabilities would be difficult, costly, uneconomic and time intensive to replicate. Our robust national service infrastructure, service record with blue chip chain customers, and strong local density provide us with differentiated customer reach, allowing us to service national and regional restaurant and hospitality chain customers under long-term agreements, including MSAs. We believe nationally we have a lower relative cost of service given our installed base and resulting scale advantages over our competitors, who are mainly local or regional industrial gas distributors that lack our service capabilities or are not exclusively focused on beverage carbonation solutions. Highly Compelling Value Proposition, Yet Low Dollar Cost to our Customers. Beverage gas remains a critical input in the carbonation of fountain and draught beer beverages, impacting their quality, consistency and taste. Because fountain and draught beer beverages represent the most profitable product in substantially all QSRs, full-service restaurants, bars, and convenience store chains, our beverage carbonation solutions represent a non-discretionary, mission critical purchase by our customers. Despite its importance, beverage gas has a low relative and absolute cost, representing less than one cent of the overall cost of a single fountain or draught beer beverage. Our typical monthly billing to our customers is only approximately one hundred dollars per location. In addition, our customers do not incur any upfront investment associated with our systems. As existing and potential customers come to understand the lost sales and profit forfeiture that results from downtime associated with traditional high pressure cylinder products, as well as the quality, safety and logistical benefits of 65 Table of Contents Business our beverage carbonation solutions, we believe beverage providers will increasingly choose our solutions at a low-dollar cost for attractive return on their investment. Contractually Secure, Low Volatility Revenue Base Drives Visible, Recurring Cash Flows. Our revenues remain contractually secure and highly visible, as more than 85% of our approximately 132,000 served locations are under some form of long-term agreement. Further, 70% of our annual revenues are fixed, regardless of volume, with the remainder of our revenue base demonstrating limited volatility on an annual basis. Our typical new customer contracts have an initial term of four to six years, provide us with the ability to pass along certain commodity costs via annual index-based price inflators and monthly fuel surcharges and include significant breakage penalties for early termination. As we typically contract for service with a chain customer's corporate franchisor and its individual franchisee locations, our revenues are also not overly dependent on any individual customer contract or geography. Our largest customer contract represented less than 3% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Because our services represent a critical input to our customers' high margin fountain and draught beer beverage revenues, and because of our integrated system of services, we have not experienced significant customer attrition. Our annual customer attrition rates over the past 2 calendar years have averaged lower than 5% per year, with voluntary customer contract termination representing less than 2% per year. Our historical customer renewal rates over the past 3 calendar years have remained in excess of 95%, demonstrating the strength of our customer value proposition. We have more than offset our customer attrition in each of the past five years with new customer installations derived through newly opened customer locations, conversion of existing high pressure beverage gas cylinder locations and share capture from competing beverage gas solutions providers. We expect this trend of net organic customer growth to continue into the foreseeable future. Predictable and Resilient End Market Demand. We believe our end users are both resilient and demonstrate sustained demand in all economic conditions, particularly QSR chains, representing more than 45% of our customer locations and a disproportionately higher percentage of our revenues, and our chain customers (defined as QSRs, full-service restaurants, convenience stores and other customers that have 10 or more locations), collectively representing 80% of our accounts. We believe QSRs will continue to demonstrate predictable demand, given their concentration of visitor frequency with QSR "heavy-users," consisting typically of 18 to 24 year-old male repeating QSR visitors, who represent approximately 20% of the QSR customer base and approximately 60% of the store-level revenues. Further, we believe QSR demand growth continues to be buoyed by the high frequency of QSR visits demonstrated by the Asian-American and Hispanic-American population segments, two of the fastest growing U.S. populations, whose QSR daily visits are two and three times the overall U.S. average. Finally, we believe our chain customers, whose new unit growth and real revenue growth from 2000 to 2005 was greater than three and four times that of non-chain restaurants, will continue to demonstrate strong relative demand, given their comparative advantages of capital, brand awareness, operating prowess and purchasing power. The demand of our chain customers is resilient. For example, during the recessionary period over the past year, as the Consumer Sentiment Index dropped from a 2008 high of 78.4 to a 2009 low of 56.3, U.S. Real GDP contracted 2.4% and U.S. unemployment increased from 5.8% in 2008 to 10.0% in 2009, we increased our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA from $146.8 million and $50.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 to $163.8 million and $62.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, representing 11.6% and 23.9% annual growth, respectively. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see the section entitled "Summary consolidated and pro forma combined financial dataDiscussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA" above. 66 Table of Contents Business Master Service Agreements Provide a Unique, Low Risk Growth Channel. We believe our unique service capabilities and dedicated national beverage supply infrastructure have allowed us to secure MSAs with 144 restaurant and convenience store chains that provide fountain beverages, including 56 MSAs with the top 100 U.S. restaurant chains, according to National Restaurant News. These MSAs generally provide for the long-term exclusive provision of beverage carbonation solutions in all corporate-owned customer locations, as well as qualified preferred vendor status for associated chain franchisees, which typically includes standardized contractual unit pricing and four to six year contractual terms of service with each store location. Our MSAs allow us to leverage our corporate franchisor relationships towards the marketing of our services to newly constructed corporate and franchisee locations or current MSA franchisee locations utilizing high pressure beverage gas cylinders. Since MSAs allow us to negotiate terms with a customer on a national or regional level, we are able to avoid the expense and time necessary to demonstrate our capabilities and to negotiate individual contract terms with each customer. We believe MSAs represent an important growth avenue for us, as we currently service approximately 73,600, or 59%, of the approximately 125,800 locations associated with our existing MSAs. Scalable Business Model with Significant Operating Leverage. As the leading national beverage carbonation solutions supplier and only dedicated supplier with national scale, we maintain a dense, highly scalable service infrastructure which we believe gives us a lower relative cost of service and an attractive margin on incremental customers. Our national reach, combined with our local route density, allows us to efficiently service additional customer locations with minimal, if any, incremental infrastructure or personnel costs, while also minimizing the average driver time and wages, mileage and fuel costs incurred between customer stops. We believe that substantially all of the target accounts not currently served by us are on delivery routes currently served by our network. We believe that the incremental margin on new customers acquired in our service network is well in excess of our consolidated margins at our current capacity levels, with minimal need for network expansion in the coming years. As our business continues to grow, we expect our scale and local route density to continue to drive enhanced operating performance, as demonstrated by the expansion of our Adjusted EBITDA margins from 35.7% in fiscal year 2004 to 38.4% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. This operating leverage allows us to target new growth opportunities with similar barriers to entry and competitive advantages, such as our recent Mini-Bulk and draught beer systems, without significant additional investment. Experienced and Proven Management Team. We are led by a high quality and experienced executive team. Our senior management team members have an average of approximately 22 years of relevant experience in the industrial gas, restaurant and distribution industries and are responsible for having grown our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA at a compound annual growth rate of 12.3% and 12.8%, respectively, from the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Under the ownership of affiliates of Aurora Capital Group, which acquired our business in 2008, we have deepened management talent at all levels of the organization, adding 14 new individuals to senior and mid-level management positions since the Acquisition. See "Corporate Structure." Eight of these senior and mid-level management positions are newly created positions and did not exist at our predecessor public company prior to the Acquisition. 67 Table of Contents Business SALES AND MARKETING As of March 31, 2010, our beverage carbonation solutions were marketed by a sales force of 21 commission-only independent sales representatives, 9 commission-only employees and 32 salaried sales personnel. We currently market our beverage carbonation solutions primarily to QSRs, as well as other restaurant chains, bars, convenience store chains and sports and entertainment venues. Our customers include many of the major national and regional chains throughout the United States. We approach large chains on a corporate or regional level for approval to become the exclusive supplier of beverage carbonation solutions on a national basis or within a designated territory. We then direct our sales efforts to the managers or owners of the individual or franchised operating units. Our relationships with chain customers in one geographic market frequently help us to establish service with these same chains when we expand into new markets. After obtaining service relationships for a chain's locations in a new market, we attempt to rapidly build route density by targeting non-chain restaurants, convenience stores and theaters for conversion to our beverage carbonation solutions. BACKLOG As of December 31, 2009, we had a signed contractual backlog of approximately 1,677 new customer locations awaiting activation. Activations are dependent upon a number of factors, including the expiration of any existing agreements the customer may have with its current beverage gas supplier. CO 2 SUPPLY Beverage grade CO 2 is currently a readily available commodity product, which is processed and sold by various sources. We currently purchase CO 2 from four suppliers: Linde LLC, Praxair, Inc., Pain Enterprises and EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. Each of these suppliers has agreed to supply our entire requirements of CO 2 at specified locations pursuant to contracts scheduled to expire on May 1, 2014. Under these contracts, our suppliers have committed to provide us with a stable supply of beverage grade CO 2 at competitive prices. In addition, most of our contracts with our suppliers provide that if sufficient quantities of CO 2 become unavailable for any reason, we will receive treatment as a preferred customer. For example, in the event of a beverage grade CO 2 shortage, many CO 2 suppliers reduce deliveries of CO 2 to all customers. Our agreements with Linde LLC, Pain Enterprises and EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. provide that we will continue to receive CO 2 deliveries in full, along with our suppliers' other large customers, prior to deliveries to other customers. Our agreements with our suppliers also require that our suppliers certify the purity of CO 2 they supply to us. Our service locations and our delivery vehicles are used solely for storage and transport of beverage-grade CO 2 to minimize any possibility of contamination. This supply system enables us to provide to our customers beverage-grade CO 2 that has a known composition and is traceable from the point of production to the point of use, a service that many customers value. CO 2 TANKS We currently purchase new CO 2 tanks from two major manufacturers. We currently purchase CO 2 tanks in a variety of sizes depending on the needs of our customers. CO 2 tanks are vacuum insulated containers with extremely high insulation characteristics allowing the storage of CO 2 , in its liquid form, at very low temperatures. Our CO 2 tanks operate under low pressure, are fully automatic and require no electricity. Based upon manufacturers' estimates, the service life of a CO 2 tank is expected to exceed 20 years. We also refurbish CO 2 tanks at our Memphis, Tennessee facility. We maintain an adequate inventory of CO 2 tanks to meet expected customer demand. 68 Table of Contents Business EMPLOYEES At March 31, 2010, we employed 786 full-time employees in our business. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement; however, employees in Chicago, Illinois have elected union representation. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Other than senior management, which is employed by NuCO 2 Florida Inc., all of our employees are employed by NuCO 2 Management LLC. TRADEMARKS We market goods and services using the NuCO 2 ®, AccuRoute® and Beverage Carbonation Made Easy® trademarks, which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The current registrations for these trademarks expire, if not renewed, in 2016 and 2017 with respect to NuCO 2 ®, and 2019 with respect to AccuRoute® and Beverage Carbonation Made Easy®. We also market goods using the XactmiX trademark, which we have applied to register with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. SEASONALITY Beverage grade CO 2 usage is subject to minor seasonal variations. Beverage grade CO 2 usage fluctuates based on factors such as weather and traditional summer and holiday periods. Demand for CO 2 in times of cold or inclement weather is lower than at other times. Based on historical data and expected trends, we anticipate that revenues from the delivery of CO 2 will be highest in our first fiscal quarter and lowest in our third fiscal quarter. REGULATORY MATTERS Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations adopted for the use, storage and handling of hazardous materials, the protection of the environment, the health and safety of their employees and users of their products and services. The transportation of CO 2 is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation. Regulatory authorities have broad powers and we are subject to regulatory and legislative changes that can affect the economics of the CO 2 business by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws, regulations and standards currently in effect and that the cost of compliance with such laws, regulations and standards has not and is not anticipated to materially adversely affect us. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in a 31,280 square foot leased facility in Stuart, Florida that accommodates corporate, administrative, customer service, marketing and sales. As of March 31, 2010, we also leased 124 stationary service locations. These facilities are rented on terms consistent with market conditions prevailing in the area. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable for our current needs and that additional or replacement facilities, if needed, are available to meet future needs. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved from time to time in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. No litigation that is currently pending is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 69 Table of Contents Business On September 21, 2005, the Estate of George Torres, a former employee, filed a lawsuit against us in the Circuit Court of Seminole County Florida for wrongful death. The plaintiff received workers' compensation benefits, but seeks damages under an intentional tort exception to workers' compensation immunity. We do not believe this claim is material. We have denied any wrongdoing and we are vigorously defending against this lawsuit. CORPORATE STRUCTURE General NuCO 2 Florida Inc., a Florida corporation previously known as NuCO 2 Inc., is wholly owned by us and was previously publicly traded before it was taken private in the Acquisition. In connection with the Acquisition we entered into the Securitization Transactions. In the Securitization Transactions: > NuCO 2 Florida Inc. transferred substantially all of its assets to the Securitization Entities; > NuCO 2 Funding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NuCO 2 Florida Inc., issued our Notes; > the Securitization Entities entered into various intercompany agreements which would permit the bulk CO 2 business to be run as an integrated business; > NuCO 2 Florida Inc. entered into the Management Services Agreement to manage the bulk CO 2 business; and > the controlling class of the holders of our Notes, upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Management Services Agreement, were given the ability to terminate the rights of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. under the Management Services Agreement and appoint in its place a replacement manager. We entered into the Securitization Transactions for a number of reasons. We believe our whole business securitization financing is a competitive advantage for us as we are afforded unique financial flexibility at minimal risk and a low cost of funding compared to more conventional financing structures. This structure allows us to fund our operations with highly-rated, lower priced debt, while subjecting us to only one financial covenant, DSCR. This structure also has less onerous restrictions on capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and changes of control than typically found in more conventional debt structures. We believe the risk of default in our capital structure is also remote, given that, based on our revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and our balance sheet as of such date, we expect that we would have needed to experience a greater than 34% decline in our collections over the following three months to breach the DSCR covenant. Our unique capital structure also provides us with a flexible maturity. Upon scheduled maturity in 2013 of our Senior Notes and our Subordinated Notes we have two successive one-year renewal periods at our option which we can utilize to extend this maturity to 2014 or 2015. 70 Table of Contents Business The securitization entities The Securitization Entities consist of the following five limited purpose Delaware limited liability companies: NuCO 2 Funding LLC, NuCO 2 LLC, NuCO 2 IP LLC, NuCO 2 Supply LLC and NuCO 2 Management LLC, collectively referred to as the Securitization Subsidiaries.

Substantially all of the assets of the Securitization Entities are pledged to secure the Notes, as are the membership interests in NuCO 2 LLC, NuCO 2 IP LLC, NuCO 2 Supply LLC and the preferred membership interests in NuCO 2 Management LLC. Set forth below is a brief summary of our corporate structure and each Securitization Entity. NuCO 2 Funding LLC.

NuCO 2 LLC. NuCO 2 LLC is a limited-purpose Delaware limited liability company that is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of NuCO 2 Funding LLC. NuCO 2 LLC owns, performs, holds, maintains, sells, disposes of and otherwise deals with our customer contracts, and is permitted to engage in other limited activities including the following: soliciting, negotiating, and entering into new customer contracts and amending and/or terminating customer contracts, contract revenue streams and the proceeds thereof; entering into the Securitization Indenture; entering into management agreements and other agreements with respect to the Securitization Entities; at times guaranteeing the performance of any obligations of the Securitization Entities; and entering into the other documents related to the Securitization Transactions or our corporate structure to which it is a party and undertaking any other activities related thereto.

The assets and operations of the Securitization Entities are governed by a series of intercompany agreements which allow our day-to-day operations to be run on an integrated basis. These intercompany agreements are also pledged as collateral to secure the Notes. The organizational documents of each of the Securitization Entities limit the activities such Securitization Entity may engage in as described above and provide for the appointment of an independent manager. Such independent manager is required to consent to any material action, including the consolidation or merger of the applicable Securitization Entity with or into another person, the sale of all or substantially all of the Securitization Entity's assets or the institution of any insolvency proceedings. In acting or otherwise voting on any such material action, the independent manager considers only the interests of the Securitization Entity, including its creditors, and not our interests or the interests of our stockholders. The management of the Securitization Entities is provided by NuCO 2 Management LLC, which has entered into the master management agreement with NuCO 2 Florida Inc. so that our senior management ultimately provides management services to the Securitization Entities. However, upon the failure by the Securitization Entities to satisfy the specified DSCR, the occurrence and continuation of an event of default under the Securitization Indenture, or the resignation of, and failure to replace, NuCO 2 Florida Inc. or NuCO 2 Management LLC as managers of the business and assets of the Securitization Entities, the holders of the Notes will have the ability to replace NuCO 2 Management LLC, and thus NuCO 2 Florida Inc. and our senior management, with a replacement manager. Events of default under the Securitization Indenture include payment defaults under the Notes, the failure to meet the specified DSCR, covenant defaults, judgment defaults above a certain threshold and bankruptcy events. 72 Table of Contents Management and board of directors EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our executive officers and directors as of April 15, 2010.

Our executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) are Messrs. DeDomenico, Gold, Gordon, Vipond, Wechsler and Ms. Strauss. STRUCTURE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS As noted above, our Board of Directors currently consists of seven members. The Board of Directors of NuCO 2 Florida, Inc. consists of the same seven individuals as our board of directors. Because we are a holding company it has generally been our practice to hold board meetings only at the operating company level. Therefore, while our Board of Directors did not meet in 2009, the NuCO 2 Florida Inc. board of directors met five times during 2009. In 2010, we began holding board meetings as joint meetings of our Board of Directors and the board of directors of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. and intend to continue to do so in the future. In accordance with the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that we plan to adopt prior to the consummation of this offering, or the new certificate of incorporation and the new 76 Table of Contents Management and board of directors bylaws, upon consummation of this offering, the terms of office of members of our Board of Directors will be divided into three classes: > Class I Directors, whose terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2011; > Class II Directors, whose terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2012; and > Class III Directors, whose terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013. Our Class I Directors will be , our Class II Directors will be and our Class III Directors will be . At each annual meeting of stockholders, the successors to the directors whose terms will then expire will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following such election. Any vacancies in our classified Board of Directors will be filled by the remaining directors and the elected person will serve the remainder of the term of the class to which he or she is appointed. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the directors. The division of our Board of Directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change of control. Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Wickham and Zusi is independent under the NYSE independence standards. As discussed above in the section entitled "Risk factors," upon consummation of this offering, we will rely on the NYSE's "controlled company" exemption. As a result, our Board of Directors will not have a majority of independent directors as would be required under the NYSE's corporate governance standards for issuers that are not controlled companies. BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE Currently, Mr. DeDomenico serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that the Company is best served at this time by this leadership structure in which a single leader serves as Chairman and CEO. Combining the roles of Chairman and CEO makes clear that the person serving in these roles has primary responsibility for managing the Company's business, under the oversight and review of the Board. The Board believes that this approach makes sense because the CEO is the individual with primary responsibility for implementing the Company's strategy, directing the work of other officers and leading implementation of the Company's strategic plans as approved by the Board. This structure results in a single leader being directly accountable to the Board and, through the Board, to our stockholders, and enables the CEO to act as the key link between the Board and other members of management. In addition, Mr. DeDomenico has a wealth of Company-specific and industry-wide knowledge gained through more than ten years of leading the Company and more than 40 years of experience in the industry, situating him well to address the unique challenges we face. The Board believes that a single leader serving as Chairman and CEO, together with an experienced and engaged lead director, is the most appropriate leadership structure for the Board once we become a public company. However, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the New Bylaws will permit the roles of Chairman and CEO to be filled by the same or different individuals. This allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be separated in the future based upon the Company's needs and the Board's assessment of the Company's leadership from time to time. 77 Table of Contents Management and board of directors The Board will review the structure of Board and Company leadership as part of its succession planning process. Following the listing of our common stock on the NYSE, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will periodically review succession planning. RISK MANAGEMENT Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing management of the Company's risks, both as a whole and also at the committee level. Our Board of Directors regularly reviews information regarding the Company's credit, liquidity and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company's executive compensation plans and arrangements. Our Audit Committee oversees management of financial risks and, effective upon the consummation of this offering, will also be responsible for overseeing potential conflicts of interests. Effective upon the consummation of this offering, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will be responsible for managing risks associated with the independence of the Board of Directors. While each committee will be responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, our full Board of Directors plans to keep itself regularly informed regarding such risks through committee reports and otherwise. CODE OF ETHICS Prior to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt a "code of ethics" as defined by the rules of the SEC under the Exchange Act applicable to our employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, as well as our directors. A copy of this code of ethics will be available on our web site at www.NuCO2.com. We intend to post on our web site any amendments to, or waivers (with respect to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and controller) from, this code of ethics required to be disclosed by applicable rules, including those of the SEC, within the time period required by such rules. BOARD COMMITTEES We currently have a standing Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. Prior to the consummation of this offering, our Board of Directors will also establish a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Because of the equity ownership of the Aurora Entities, we are considered a "controlled company" for the purposes of the NYSE's listing requirements. As such, we are exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including with respect to the independence of our Compensation Committee and our Nominating and Governance Committee. Upon consummation of this offering, we will rely on this exemption and therefore will not satisfy all of the independence requirements applicable to compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees under the NYSE's corporate governance standards for issuers that are not controlled companies. We believe that the composition of our Audit Committee meets the criteria for independence under, and the functioning of these committees will comply with the requirements of, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the NYSE and the SEC rules and regulations that will become applicable to us upon consummation of this offering as a controlled company. We intend to comply with the requirements of the NYSE with respect to committee composition of independent directors as they become applicable. Summarized below are the responsibilities our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee will have upon consummation of this offering as well as the responsibilities we expect our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to have upon its creation. 78 Table of Contents Management and board of directors Audit committee Prior to the consummation of this offering, our Board of Directors will adopt a written charter under which our Audit Committee will operate. This charter will set forth the duties and responsibilities of our Audit Committee, which, among other things, will include: the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm; evaluation of our independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence and performance; review and approval of the scope of our annual audit and audit fee; review of our critical accounting policies and estimates; review of the results of our annual audit and our quarterly consolidated financial statements; and oversight of our internal audit function. A copy of our Audit Committee charter will be available on our web site at www.NuCO2.com prior to the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. The current members of our Audit Committee are Messrs. Alpern, Wickham and Zusi, of whom Messrs. Wickham and Zusi are independent within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Zusi is an audit committee financial expert, as such term is defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. In accordance with Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the NYSE, we plan to appoint a third independent director to our Audit Committee to replace Mr. Alpern within 12 months after the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to this offering so that all of our Audit Committee members will be independent within the meaning of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the NYSE. The Audit Committee did not meet in 2009 as it was constituted in 2010. However, the NuCO 2 Florida Inc. audit committee met nine times during 2009. As with our Board of Directors and the board of directors of NuCO 2 Florida Inc., the audit committee of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. consists of the same three members as our Audit Committee. Because we are a holding company it has generally been our practice to hold audit committee meetings at the operating company level. However, following the formation of our Audit Committee in 2010, we began holding audit committee meetings at the NuCO 2 Inc. level and intend to do so on a going forward basis. Compensation committee Prior to the consummation of this offering, our Board of Directors will adopt a written charter under which our Compensation Committee will operate. This charter will set forth the duties and responsibilities of our Compensation Committee, which, among other things, will include: oversight of our overall compensation structure, policies and programs; review and approval of the compensation programs applicable to our executive officers; determination of the compensation of our directors; administering, reviewing and making recommendations with respect to our equity compensation plans; and reviewing succession planning for our executive officers. A copy of our Compensation Committee charter will be available on our web site at www.NuCO2.com prior to the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. The current members of our Compensation Committee are Messrs. Bossidy, Frey and Rosenbaum, none of whom is independent under the rules of the NYSE. The Compensation Committee did not meet during 2009 as it was constituted in 2010. However, the NuCO 2 Florida Inc. compensation committee met four times during 2009. As with our Board of Directors and the board of directors of NuCO 2 Florida Inc., the compensation committee of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. consists of the same three members as our Compensation Committee. Because we are a holding company it has generally been our practice to hold compensation committee meetings at the operating company level. However, following the formation of our Compensation Committee in 2010, we began holding compensation committee meetings as joint meetings of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors and 79 Table of Contents Management and board of directors the compensation committee of the board of directors of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. and intend to do so on a going forward basis. Nominating and corporate governance committee Prior to the consummation of this offering, our Board of Directors will adopt a written charter under which our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will operate. This charter will set forth the duties and responsibilities of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which, among other things, will include: recruiting and retaining qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, including proposing such individuals to our Board of Directors for nomination for election as directors; evaluating the performance, size and composition of our Board of Directors; establishing procedures for the consideration of Board of Director candidates recommended by the Company's stockholders; assessing the independence of each member of our Board of Directors; and overseeing our compliance activities. A copy of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter will be available on our web site at www.NuCO2.com prior to the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. Prior to the listing of our common stock on the NYSE, we expect to appoint as members of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Compensation committee interlocks and insider participation As discussed above, we did not have a Compensation Committee in fiscal year 2009. However, during fiscal year 2009, the compensation committee of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. consisted of Messrs. Bossidy, Frey and Rosenbaum. None of the foregoing members of our Compensation Committee and the compensation committee of NuCO 2 Florida Inc. is an officer or employee of the Company or NuCO 2 Florida Inc. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee. LIMITATION OF DIRECTORS' LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION The Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors' fiduciary duties. Our new certificate of incorporation will include a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director, except for liability: > for breach of the duty of loyalty; > for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law; > under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (relating to unlawful dividends); or > for transactions from which the director derived improper personal benefit. Our new bylaws will provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law. We are and will be expressly authorized to carry directors' and officers' insurance providing indemnification for our directors, officers and certain employees for some liabilities. We believe that these indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and officers. 80 Table of Contents Management and board of directors The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that will be included in our new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. In addition to the indemnification to be provided by our new bylaws, prior to the consummation of this offering, we will enter into agreements to indemnify our directors and executive officers. These agreements, subject to certain exceptions, will require us to, among other things, indemnify these directors and executive officers for certain expenses, including attorney fees, witness fees and expenses, expenses of accountants and other advisors, and the premium, security for and other costs relating to any bond, arising out of that person's services as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request. There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought. 81 Table of Contents Executive compensation COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Objectives of our compensation programs Our compensation programs are designed to enable us to attract and retain high-caliber executive officers and to motivate them to maximize performance while building stockholder value. We accomplish these objectives by providing our named executive officers, who are identified below, with short-term cash programs (annual base salary and annual incentive plan), long-term equity awards (stock options) and certain perquisites. Although our compensation program provides for a mix of both short- and long-term compensation and cash and non-cash compensation, we do not have any specific policy on those allocations. Our named executive officers for 2009 were Mr. DeDomenico, Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Vipond, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Wade, former Chief Operating Officer; Mr. Gold, Senior Vice President of Sales; and Mr. Wechsler, General Counsel and Secretary. Determining executive compensation Since 2008, our executives' compensation has been determined by the compensation committee of NuCO 2 Florida Inc., which we refer to as the NuCO 2 Florida Committee, after receiving input from our Chief Executive Officer other than with respect to himself. Each of our named executive officers is party to an employment agreement that sets forth his initial base salary and target bonus level under our annual incentive plan. In addition, our Board of Directors determines equity awards for our named executive officers. The NuCO 2 Florida Committee and our Chief Executive Officer receive input on the competitiveness of the Company's executive compensation programs relative to comparable companies from compensation consulting firm, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., or FW Cook. FW Cook provides the NuCO 2 Florida Committee and our Chief Executive Officer with the relevant market data for each named executive officer's position. Going forward, we anticipate that our executive compensation programs will be determined and set by our Compensation Committee, which currently consists of the same three members as the NuCO 2 Florida Committee, in the same manner as previously determined and set by the NuCO 2 Florida Committee and, with respect to equity awards, our Board of Directors. Benchmarking The NuCO 2 Florida Committee periodically compares the base salary and bonus components of its pay program against a group of fifteen publicly traded companies, or the Peer Group. The companies comprising the Peer Group are developed by FW Cook and are comparable in size, based on EBITDA, net income and market capitalization and/or conduct a business similar to ours. The Peer Group companies are as follows: Aceto Corporation Flow International Corporation Material Sciences Corporation Balchem Corporation Insituform Technologies, Inc. Met-Pro Corporation Blount International, Inc. K-Tron International, Inc. Mobile Mini, Inc. Calgon Carbon Corporation Lawson Products, Inc. TAL International Group, Inc. Coinstar, Inc. Life Sciences Research, Inc. TurboChef Technologies, Inc. Historically, the NuCO 2 Florida Committee has determined that the base salary and target bonus levels of the named executive officers would be set between the 50 th and 75 th percentile for comparable positions in the Peer Group companies in order to compete with similar companies for executive 82 Table of Contents Executive compensation talent, with further adjustments depending on subjective criteria such as an individual's qualifications and experience. Although our Board of Directors ultimately approves equity grants, the NuCO 2 Florida Committee also reviews and compares the amount of equity held by each named executive officer against the Peer Group data. Because NuCO 2 is a privately-held enterprise whose equity is not publicly-traded, equity levels are set above the 75 th percentile in order to serve as a retentive and motivational tool for our named executive officers. Elements of executive compensation The key components of our compensation program for our named executive officers are base salary, the Management Incentive Plan, the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan and other compensation consisting primarily of matching 401(k) contributions, health and welfare benefits and other perquisites. Base salary We pay our named executive officers a base salary to compensate them for services rendered and to provide them with a steady source of income for living expenses throughout the year. In general, the base salary of each executive was initially established through arm's-length negotiations at the time the individual was hired, taking into account the individual's qualifications, experience, level of responsibility, as well as internal pay equity considerations and input from FW Cook. Historically any increases to the base salaries of our named executive officers were reviewed and approved at the end of each fiscal year by the NuCO 2 Florida Committee. Beginning in 2010 this review and approval process will be conducted by our Compensation Committee. In approving base salary increases, the NuCO 2 Florida Committee has taken into account, and going forward our Compensation Committee will take into account, input from the Chief Executive Officer for the other named executive officers. Adjustments are based on individual performance, internal pay equity considerations and input from FW Cook, but we do not assign a specific weight to any single factor in making decisions regarding base salary adjustments. For 2009, the NuCO 2 Florida Committee determined that each named executive officer, other than Mr. Vipond, who was hired at the beginning of 2009 and thus was not subject to a salary review, would receive a 4% increase in his base salary, as a cost of living adjustment. Additionally, Mr. Gold received an additional increase in his base salary as a market adjustment for his position based on input from FW Cook. In 2009 the base salaries for our executives were increased as follows: Named executive officer Current Salary Base salary increase % increase Michael DeDomenico $ 551,200 $ 21,200 4.0 % J. Robert Vipond $ 325,000   William Scott Wade $ 321,681 $ 12,371 4.0 % Randy Gold $ 240,000 $ 20,000 9.1 % Eric Wechsler $ 268,321 $ 10,321 4.0 % Management incentive plan Our named executive officers, as well as other key management employees, participate in the Management Incentive Plan, which we refer to in this prospectus as the MIP. The MIP provides the named executive officers with an opportunity to earn additional cash compensation in the form of bonuses that are awarded if we attain certain financial criteria established each year. We believe that making a significant portion of executive officer compensation subject to the achievement of performance goals motivates executive officers to increase their efforts on behalf of the Company. 83 Table of Contents Executive compensation Target Bonus Levels. The MIP has target bonuses for the named executive officers, expressed as a percentage of base salary, that are set forth in each named executive officer's employment agreement, as follows: Named executive officer Target bonus level Michael DeDomenico 70 % J. Robert Vipond 50 % William Scott Wade 50 % Randy Gold 50 % Eric Wechsler 35 % Bonus Determinations. Under the MIP, each year (generally during the first quarter), the NuCO 2 Florida Committee established company-wide financial performance objectives, which serve as the basis for determining the amount of bonuses to be paid. The committee determined the types of performance metrics, relative weighting and target levels for each metric in consultation with management and taking into account our performance for the immediately preceding year. The 2009 performance metrics under the MIP are comprised of two components, adjusted EBITDA and Return on Tangible Assets, or ROTA, weighted 75% and 25%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA has historically been a significant performance metric under the MIP because it measures our operating performance. We believe ROTA is a good indication of how efficiently we are using our assets to generate earnings, which, if successful, ultimately drives value to our stockholders. We must achieve at least 90% of the target objective for any bonuses to be paid under the MIP. Such threshold achievement would result in bonus payouts to a named executive officer at no more than 50% such officer's individual target bonus level. The maximum bonus payout to a named executive officer, based on achievement of at least 110% of the target objective, is 150% of such officer's individual target bonus level. After the end of the 2009 fiscal year, the NuCO 2 Florida Committee reviewed in conjunction with our Chief Executive Officer, our performance with respect to the performance metrics and determined the amount of bonuses to be paid under the program as a whole. After determining the overall amount of bonuses to be paid under the MIP for the year, the NuCO 2 Florida Committee determined actual bonus payouts to each named executive officer based on its subjective determinations of each individual's overall performance and contribution during the year, and, with respect to each named executive officer other than Mr. DeDomenico, the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Vipond's bonus for 2009 also included a special recognition bonus of $30,000 outside of his award under the MIP for his individual achievements during the year, including his role in enhancing our financial reporting system and in one Enterprise Resource Planning project, in the nexAir Acquisition and productivity initiatives. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a target bonus pool of $2.0 million was established, based on adjusted EBITDA of $54.3 million and ROTA of 35.8%. Actual results were $57.7 million and 37.6%, respectively, resulting in a total approved payout under the MIP of $2.17 million. In addition, the NuCO 2 Florida Committee approved an additional pool of $200,000 due to the successful acquisition and integration of the beverage carbonation business of nexAir, LLC. The NuCO 2 Florida Committee has the discretion to adjust awards under the MIP if the financial performance goals in a given fiscal year are not met in recognition of the named executive officers' respective overall performance. For 2009, each named executive officer received bonuses under the MIP ranging from 112% to 121% of their respective target levels due to the Company exceeding the MIP target objectives, the additional pool attributable to nexAir, LLC and the NuCO 2 Florida Committee's subjective determinations as to individual performance. For the actual payouts to the named executive 84 Table of Contents Executive compensation officers and their respective target amounts, please refer to the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table below. Long-term incentive compensation We introduced the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, which we refer to in this prospectus as the 2008 Stock Plan, in May 2008 in connection with the Acquisition. The purposes of the 2008 Stock Plan are to attract, motivate and retain key employees, non-employee directors, consultants and advisors by providing for or increasing their proprietary interests in the Company. We believe that long-term performance is achieved through an ownership culture that rewards and encourages long-term performance by our named executive officers though the use of stock-based awards. The Board of Directors determines who will receive awards under the 2008 Stock Plan and the terms and conditions of those awards. In determining the size of a stock option grant, the Board of Directors takes into consideration the individual's impact on Company performance, the number of option grants available and internal pay equity considerations. Our named executive officers who were employed at the time of the Acquisition and the adoption of the 2008 Stock Plan received their option grants at that time. Although not required, to date all stock option grants subsequent to the Acquisition have been made in connection with a named executive officer's commencement of employment and the amounts thereof resulted from arms-length negotiations in connection with such commencement of employment. When Mr. Vipond commenced employment in 2009, he received options to acquire 1,931 shares of our common stock, an amount consistent with prior grants made to our named executive officers with comparable responsibilities. All stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options vest over a 5 year period at 20% per year on the anniversary of the grant date. The Company believes this vesting schedule appropriately encourages long-term employment with our Company, while allowing our named executive officers to realize compensation in line with creating stockholder value. Other compensation In addition to their base salaries and awards under the incentive plans described above, our named executive officers receive matching contributions under our 401(k) plan in the same manner as all of our employees who participate in the plan. We match 50% of a participant's pre-tax contributions up to the first 4% of such participant's base salary up to the maximum allowed by the plan. Each named executive officer is also eligible to participate in all other benefit plans and programs that are or may be available to our other executive employees, including any health insurance or health care plan, disability insurance, vacation and sick leave and other similar plans. Our named executive officers also receive certain perquisites and participate in a group long-term disability plan for management. Mr. DeDomenico receives an annual perquisite allowance of $25,000 to cover the costs of long-term disability insurance, his automobile lease and other incidentals, and each of the other named executive officers receives a monthly perquisite allowance of $650 to cover the costs of an automobile lease and other incidentals. All of these named executive officers also receive tax gross-ups on taxes incurred in connection with these perquisite allowances. Additionally, Mr. Vipond is entitled to certain relocation benefits as a result of his agreement to relocate to the Stuart, Florida area at the time of his initial hire. The benefits under this arrangement are designed to cover the costs incurred by him in connection with the sale of his prior residence and his temporary living expenses, and Mr. Vipond receives a tax gross-up on any income taxes incurred by him in connection with these benefits. We also paid for his moving expenses when he relocated to the Stuart, Florida area. 85 Table of Contents Executive compensation We believe these limited perquisites and personal benefits are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. Severance and change of control arrangements All of our named executive officers are parties to employment agreements with us. Under the employment agreements, each of our named executive officers except Mr. Wechsler, is eligible for severance benefits consisting of base salary continuation (ranging from one year to two years) and a pro-rated target bonus for the year of termination if we terminate his employment without cause or he resigns for good reason. Mr. Wechsler is entitled to one year of base salary if we terminate him without cause. In addition, each named executive officer is entitled to accelerated vesting of a portion of his then outstanding stock options. Each of the employment agreements also provides severance benefits in the event of a named executive officer's death or permanent incapacitation. In the event of death, the executive's estate is entitled to receive an amount (offset by any life insurance proceeds from any company-sponsored life insurance policies) equal to (i) 100% of the executive's base salary and target bonus (in the case of Mr. DeDomenico) or (ii) 100% of the compensation received by such executive in the twelve month period preceding his death (in the case of the other named executive officers). In the event of permanent incapacitation, the executive is entitled to receive 100% of his base salary (plus target bonus in the case of Mr. DeDomenico). In addition, all of the named executive officers are entitled to accelerated vesting of a portion of the executive's then outstanding stock options. We provide these benefits to promote retention and ease the consequences to an executive (and/or his or her estate) in the event of an unexpected termination of employment. We also provide enhanced severance benefits in the event of a change of control. First, all of the unvested options held by our named executive officers become fully vested. Second, under each of the employment agreements with our named executive officers, if the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within the two year period following a change of control, he is entitled to a severance amount ranging from one to two times his base salary plus target bonus for the year of termination, in each case with a guaranteed minimum severance amount as set forth in his employment agreement. Each of the employment agreements also provides for certain protections to either compensate the executive for excise taxes imposed on these severance benefits, or to avoid the imposition of such excise taxes. We believe these enhanced severance benefits will keep our named executive officers focused on stockholders interests rather than income security in the event of a potential change of control transaction. Please refer to the discussion below in the section entitled "Executive CompensationPotential payments upon termination or change of control" for a more detailed discussion of our severance and change of control arrangements. Stock ownership guidelines The are currently no equity ownership requirements or guidelines that any of our named executive officers or other employees must meet or maintain. Policy regarding restatements We do not currently have a formal policy requiring a fixed course of action with respect to compensation adjustments following later restatements of financial results. Under those circumstances, 86 Table of Contents Executive compensation our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee would evaluate whether compensation adjustments were appropriate based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement. Tax deductibility The NuCO 2 Florida Committee has considered the potential future effects of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, on the compensation paid to our named executive officers. Section 162(m) places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that a publicly held corporation may deduct in any one year with respect to its chief executive officer and each of the next three most highly compensated executive officers (other than its chief financial officer). In general, certain performance-based compensation approved by stockholders is not subject to this deduction limit. As we are not currently publicly-traded, neither the NuCO 2 Florida Committee nor our Compensation Committee has previously taken the deductibility limit imposed by Section 162(m) into consideration in making compensation decisions. We expect that following the consummation of this offering, our Compensation Committee will adopt a policy that, where reasonably practicable, we will seek to qualify the variable compensation paid to our named executive officers for an exemption from the deductibility limits of Section 162(m). However, we may authorize compensation payments that do not comply with the exemptions in Section 162(m) when we believe that such payments are appropriate to attract and retain executive talent.

As a result, modifications were made to the vesting schedule such that in the final year of vesting, options to acquire 933 shares, rather than 946 shares, of our common stock vest. Potential payments upon termination or change of control The information below describes certain compensation and benefits to which our named executive officers are entitled in the event their employment is terminated under certain circumstances and/or a change of control occurs. See the table at the end of this section for the amount of compensation and benefits that would have become payable under existing plans and contractual arrangements assuming a termination of employment and/or change of control had occurred on June 30, 2009 based upon the estimated fair value of our common stock on that date, given the named executive officers' compensation and service levels as of such date. There can be no assurance that an actual triggering event would produce the same or similar results as those estimated if such event occurs on any other date or at any other price, or if any other assumption used to estimate potential payments and benefits is not correct. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any potential payments or benefits, any actual payments and benefits may be different. Termination events occurring outside a change of control period Termination Without Cause or Resignation For Good Reason. We are parties to employment agreements with all of our named executive officers, all of which were entered into prior to June 30, 2009. Messrs. DeDomenico, Vipond, Wade and Gold. Under these employment agreements, if we terminate the executive's employment without Cause (as defined below), or if the executive resigns for Good Reason (as defined below), the executive is entitled to receive severance benefits consisting of base salary continuation and a pro-rated target bonus under the MIP for the year of termination. Under such circumstances, Mr. DeDomenico is entitled to two years of his base salary, payable in six quarterly installments and the other named executive officers are entitled to one year of his base salary, payable in four quarterly installments. The pro-rated portion of MIP bonus is payable at the time bonuses are determined. In addition, Mr. Vipond is entitled to receive any relocation benefits not paid as of the date of termination. Mr. Wade's last day of employment with the Company was March 14, 2010, and he will receive severance benefits consistent with his employment agreement. 90 Table of Contents Executive compensation Mr. Wechsler. Under Mr. Wechsler's employment agreement, if he is terminated without Cause (as defined below), he is entitled to receive one year of his base salary, payable in four quarterly installments. All named executive officers. Each executive may continue to receive benefits for the salary continuation period on the same basis as prior to the date of termination. Severance payments are generally subject to the executive's compliance with certain non-competition and confidentiality covenants (described in more detail below) during the salary continuation period. Under each employment agreement, "Cause" means the executive (a) engages in any criminal conduct constituting a felony and criminal charges are brought against the executive by a governmental authority; (b) knowingly and willfully fails or refuses to perform his duties and responsibilities in a manner consistent with his position or other officers of similar position in the Company to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board of Directors or (c) knowingly and willfully engages in activities which would constitute a material breach of any term of the employment agreement or result in a material injury to our business condition, financial or otherwise, results of operation or prospects, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, and such activity is not cured by the executive within thirty days of the executive's receipt of notice from us. Under each employment agreement, "Good Reason" means (a) an involuntary change in the executive's status or position with us that constitutes a demotion from the executive's then-current status or position and a material change in the nature or scope of powers, authority or duties inherent in such position; (b) a reduction in the executive's compensation (or, solely with respect to Mr. DeDomenico, a reduction in his base salary or a material change to his bonus structure); (c) any action or inaction by us that would adversely affect the executive's continued participation in any benefit plan on at least as favorable basis as was the case at the time of such action or inaction or deprive him of any material benefits that he then enjoyed, except to the extent that such action or inaction by us (i) is also taken or not taken, as the case may be, in respect of all employees generally, (ii) is required by the terms of any benefit plan as in effect immediately before such action or inaction or (iii) is necessary to comply with applicable law or to preserve the qualification of any benefit plan under Section 401(a) of the Code; (d) a material change in the principal work location (or, solely with respect to Mr. DeDomenico, a change in excess of a 50 mile radius from the current location in Stuart, Florida); (e) our failure, or the failure of our successor or any person or Group of Persons (as defined below) acquiring substantially all of our assets to assume any and all terms of the employment agreement or (f) a material breach of the employment agreement by us, our successor or a person or Group of Persons acquiring substantially all of our assets, in each case which remains uncured for 30 days following written notice from the executive, which notice must be provided by the executive within 90 days of the event giving rise to Good Reason. Under each employment agreement, "Group of Persons" means any group of persons or entities acting in concert as a partnership or other group. Each of the employment agreements contains a non-competition provision that prevents the named executive officer from working for or investing in our competitors for two years after termination of employment, and a perpetual nondisclosure provision. Termination due to Permanent Incapacitation. Under the employment agreements, if the executive's employment terminates due to Permanent Incapacitation (as defined below), the executive is entitled to receive benefits consisting of 100% of his base salary and target bonus under the MIP for the current fiscal year, payable in six quarterly installments (in the case of Mr. DeDomenico), and 100% of his base salary, payable in four quarterly installments (in the case of the other named executive officers). We would also continue each executive's benefits for the salary continuation period on the same basis as prior to the date of termination. Each of the named executive officers would also receive long term 91 Table of Contents Executive compensation disability benefits under the group long term disability plan we maintain for our executives. Under this plan, each executive is entitled to a monthly benefit equal to 60% of his monthly salary for a specified period of time, subject to a maximum monthly benefit of $15,000. Payments under this plan do not commence until the salary continuation period expires. Mr. Vipond is also entitled to receive any relocation benefits not paid as of the date of termination. Under the employment agreements, "Permanent Incapacitation" means that the executive, by reason of his physical or mental disability, fails to substantially perform his usual and regular duties for us for a consecutive period of four months or for six months in any eighteen month period, subject to certification by a licensed physician, reasonably acceptable to the executive and us, that the nature of the executive's disability is such that it will continue as a substantial impediment to the executive's ability to substantially perform his duties. Termination due to Death. Under the employment agreements, if the executive's employment terminates due to his death, the executive's beneficiaries are entitled to receive benefits consisting of 100% of his base salary and target bonus under the MIP for the current fiscal year, payable in twelve monthly installments (in the case of Mr. DeDomenico), and 100% of the compensation received by the executive during the twelve month period prior to his death, payable in twelve monthly installments (in the case of the other named executive officers). These benefits would be offset by any proceeds from a life insurance policy for the executive maintained by us. We would also continue each executive's benefits for his beneficiaries for the salary continuation period on the same basis as prior to the date of termination. In addition, Mr. Vipond is entitled to receive any relocation benefits not paid as of the date of termination. Treatment of Stock Options. Under the terms of each employment agreement and option award agreement, in the event a named executive officer's employment terminates for any of the foregoing reasons ( i.e ., without Cause, due to Permanent Incapacitation or death, or, with respect to the named executive officers other than Mr. Wechsler, Good Reason), any unvested stock options scheduled to vest at the next applicable vesting date would vest pro-rata according to the number of whole or partial months the executive was employed during the relevant vesting period, and he would be entitled to exercise all vested stock options held by him for a period of six months after the termination date. In the event an executive's employment with us terminates for any other reason (other than Cause) , he would be entitled to exercise all vested stock options held by him for a period of 90 days after the termination date. Termination without cause or resignation for good reason during a change of control period Each of our employment agreements provides for enhanced severance benefits in the event the executive's employment is terminated without Cause or the executive resigns for Good Reason during the two year period following a Change of Control (as defined below). Thus, these enhanced severance benefits are payable only in connection with a so-called "double trigger" (a Change of Control followed by a termination of employment under certain circumstances). These arrangements are intended to preserve productivity and encourage retention in the face of the disruptive impact of a change of control and to allow our executives to focus on the value of strategic alternatives to stockholders without concern for the impact on their employment. The severance payments to the named executive officers would be in the form of a lump sum payment (to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code), in the following amounts: > Mr. DeDomenico: The greater of (i) two times his base salary and target bonus under the MIP for the year of termination and (ii) $1,802,000. 92 Table of Contents Executive compensation > Mr. Vipond: The greater of (i) one and a half times his base salary and target bonus for the year of termination and (ii) $731,250. > Mr. Wade: The greater of (i) one and a half times his base salary and target bonus for the year of termination and (ii) $695,948. Mr. Wade's last day with the Company was March 14, 2010, which was outside of a Change of Control period and he will receive severance benefits consistent with his employment agreement. > Mr. Gold: The greater of (i) his base salary and target bonus for the year of termination and (ii) $330,000. > Mr. Wechsler: The greater of (i) his base salary and target bonus for the year of termination and (ii) $348,300. In addition, we would continue each executive's benefits on the same basis as prior to the date of termination for eighteen months (in the case of Messrs. DeDomenico, Vipond and Wade) and twelve months (in the case of Messrs. Gold and Wechsler), or such earlier date if the executive obtains comparable benefit coverage from a subsequent employer. Each of our named executive officers, other than Mr. Wechsler, may be entitled to a tax gross-up payment in connection with Section 280G of the Code, or if the benefits payable to these named executive officers do not exceed 110% of the safe harbor limits established by Section 280G of the Code, then the benefits are reduced to such safe harbor limits. Mr. Wechsler is not entitled to a tax gross-up payment; instead, we cap his benefits at the Section 280G safe harbor limits if the after-tax benefit to him is greater than the after-tax benefit of the full amount. For purposes of the employment agreements, "Change of Control" means the occurrence, during any twelve month period of (i) the direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all (50% or more) of the assets of the Company to any person or group of persons, (ii) the merger, consolidation or other business combination of the Company with or into another corporation with the effect that the stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, immediately following the merger, consolidation or other business combination, hold 50% or less of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the surviving corporation of such merger, consolidation or other business combination ordinarily (and apart from rights accruing under special circumstances) having the right to vote in the election of directors, (iii) the replacement of a majority of the Board of Directors in any given year as compared to the directors who constituted the Board of Directors at the beginning of such year, and such replacement shall not have been approved by the Board of Directors, as the case may be, as constituted at the beginning of the year or (iv) a person or Group of Persons shall, as a result of a tender or exchange offer, open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, have become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of such corporation ordinarily (and apart from rights accruing under special circumstances) having the right to vote in the election of directors. Treatment of stock options in a change of control In addition to the double trigger severance benefits, under the terms of each option award agreement with our named executive officers, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined below), all unvested options held by the executive accelerate and become fully vested. For purposes of option acceleration, "Change of Control" means any time, (i) NuCO 2 ceases to own 100% of the equity interests of NuCO 2 Florida Inc.; (ii) the Aurora Entities and their affiliates collectively shall fail to own, or to have the power to vote or direct the voting of, our voting stock representing more than 35% of the voting power of our total outstanding voting stock; (iii) any person (other than the Aurora Entities and their 93 Table of Contents Executive compensation affiliates) is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that for purposes of this clause, such person or group shall be deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of all securities that such person or group has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), directly or indirectly, of our voting stock representing more voting power than the Aurora Entities and their affiliates collectively own (or have the power to vote or direct the voting of) or (iv) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors (together with any new directors whose election to the Board of Directors or whose nomination for election was approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, which members comprising the majority are then still in office and were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors. The table below sets forth the estimated value of the potential payments to each of the named executive officers, assuming the executive's employment had terminated on June 30, 2009 and/or that a Change of Control had occurred on that date. These figures are based on the employment agreements in effect on June 30, 2009.

The following is a summary of the material terms of the 2010 Stock Plan. This description is not complete. For more information, we refer you to the full text of the 2010 Stock Plan, which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. The 2010 Stock Plan will authorize the grant of "non-qualified" stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and incentive bonuses to employees, officers, non-employee directors and other service providers to us and our subsidiaries. The number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to all awards granted under the 2010 Stock Plan will not exceed shares of our common stock, plus any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan that on or after , 2010 cease to be subject to such awards. The number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2010 Stock Plan (or pursuant to outstanding awards) is subject to adjustment as a result of mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, stock splits, stock dividends and other changes in our common stock. Shares subject to awards that have been canceled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued under an award and shares subject to awards settled in cash do no count as shares issued under the 2010 Stock Plan. In addition, (i) shares that were subject to a stock-settled SAR and were not issued upon the net settlement or net exercise of such SAR, (ii) shares used to pay the exercise price of a stock option, (iii) shares delivered to or withheld by us to pay the withholding taxes related to an award and (iv) shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an option exercise do not count as shares issued under the 2010 Stock Plan. Administration. The 2010 Stock Plan will be administered by our Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have the discretion to determine the individuals to whom awards may be granted under the 2010 Stock Plan, the manner in which such awards will vest and the other conditions applicable to awards. Options, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs and incentive bonuses may be granted by the Compensation Committee to employees, officers, non-employee directors and other service providers in such numbers and at such times during the term of the 2010 Stock Plan as the Compensation Committee shall determine. The Compensation Committee will be authorized to interpret the 2010 Stock Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the 2010 Stock Plan and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the 2010 Stock Plan. All decisions, determinations and interpretations by the Compensation Committee, and any rules and regulations under the 2010 Stock Plan and the terms and conditions of or operation of any award, are final and binding on all participants, beneficiaries, heirs, assigns or other persons holding or claiming rights under the 2010 Stock Plan or any award. Options. The Compensation Committee will determine the exercise price and other terms for each option and whether the options are non-qualified stock options or incentive stock options. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees and are subject to certain other restrictions. To the extent an option intended to be an incentive stock option does not so qualify, it will be treated as a non-qualified option. A participant may exercise an option by written notice and payment of the exercise price in shares, cash or a combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee, including an irrevocable commitment by a broker to pay over such amount from a sale of the shares issuable under an option, the delivery of previously owned shares and withholding of shares deliverable upon exercise. Stock appreciation rights. The Compensation Committee may grant SARs independent of or in connection with an option. The exercise price per share of a SAR will be an amount determined by the 95 Table of Contents Executive compensation Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee will determine the other terms applicable to SARs. Generally, each SAR will entitle a participant upon exercise to an amount equal to: > the excess of the fair market value on the exercise date of one share of common stock over the exercise price, multiplied by > the number of shares of common stock covered by the SAR. Payment shall be made in common stock or in cash, or partly in common stock and partly in cash, all as shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock and restricted stock units. The Compensation Committee may award restricted common stock and RSUs. Restricted stock awards consist of shares of common stock that are transferred to the participant subject to restrictions that may result in forfeiture if specified conditions are not satisfied. RSUs result in the transfer of shares of cash or common stock to the participant only after specified conditions are satisfied. The Compensation Committee will determine the restrictions and conditions applicable to each award of restricted stock or RSUs, which may include performance vesting conditions. Incentive bonuses. An incentive bonus is an opportunity for a participant to earn a future payment tied to the level of achievement with respect to one or more performance criteria established for a performance period set by the Compensation Committee. Payment of the amount due under an incentive bonus may be made in cash or in shares, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Performance criteria. Vesting of awards granted under the 2010 Stock Plan may be subject to the satisfaction of one or more performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. The performance goals may vary from participant to participant, group to group, and period to period. Transferability. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, awards granted under the 2010 Stock Plan will not be transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Change of control. The Compensation Committee may provide, either at the time an award is granted or thereafter, that a change of control (as defined in the 2010 Stock Plan) that occurs after the offering shall have such effect as specified by the Compensation Committee, or no effect, as the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion may provide. Amendment and termination. Awards will be granted under the 2010 Stock Plan only during the ten years following the effective date of the 2010 Stock Plan. Our Board of Directors will have the authority to amend, alter or discontinue the 2010 Stock Plan in any respect at any time, but no amendment may diminish any of the rights of a participant under any awards previously granted, without his or her consent. In addition, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment that would increase the maximum number of shares available for awards, reduce the price at which options may be granted, change the class of eligible participants, or otherwise when stockholder approval is required by law or under stock exchange listing requirements. 2008 Stock incentive plan Our Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders subsequently approved, the NuCO 2 Parent, Inc. 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. An aggregate of 18,090 shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. Following the adoption of the 2010 Stock Plan, we will not issue any further awards under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. 96 Table of Contents Executive compensation The 2008 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of equity awards to our executives, non-employee directors, consultants, advisors, independent contractors and key employees and employees of AMP. Awards are not restricted to any specified form or structure and may include, without limitation, sales or bonuses of common stock, restricted stock, stock options, reload stock options, stock purchase warrants, other rights to acquire common stock, securities convertible into or redeemable for common stock, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, dividend equivalents, performance units or performance shares. As of June 30, 2009, options to purchase an aggregate of 17,368 shares of our common stock were outstanding under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan with a weighted average exercise price per share of $1,057. No awards other than stock options have been granted under the terms of the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, and we have no current intentions to issue any additional awards (in the form of stock options or otherwise) under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. The 2008 Stock Incentive Plan is administered by our Board of Directors. Options granted under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan are evidenced by stock option agreements containing such provisions as our Board of Directors deems advisable. All options granted under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan expire not more than 10 years after the date of grant and have an exercise price that is determined by our Board of Directors, but in no event is less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Options issued under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan generally vest ratably over five years (20% on the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date), provided that the participant is then employed by us, but may be subject to certain acceleration provisions, including full acceleration in connection with a change of control. Full payment for shares of common stock purchased on the exercise of an option must be made at the time of such exercise in a manner approved by our Board of Directors. Shares of our common stock acquired under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan may not be transferred by the participant other than pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution or to certain family members or trusts established solely for the benefit thereof, and are generally subject to a right of first refusal in favor of us. The right of first refusal will terminate upon the consummation of this offering. For more information about transfer restrictions on shares of our common stock acquired under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan following the consummation of this offering, see the section entitled "Certain relationships and related party transactionsRelated Party TransactionsSecurityholders agreementTransfer Restrictions." Our Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan at any time, subject to certain restrictions. Outstanding awards may be amended, however, only with the consent of the holder. We expect that our Compensation Committee will administer the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan following the consummation of this offering. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS Only four of our directors, Messrs. Bossidy, Frey, Wickham and Zusi, have received any compensation in connection with their service on our Board of Directors. Messrs. Bossidy, Frey and Wickham were granted options to purchase, respectively, 789, 1,775 and 236 shares of our common stock under our 2008 Stock Incentive Plan in fiscal year 2008 at an exercise price of $1,000, all of which remained outstanding as of June 30, 2009. During 2009, Mr. Zusi, in connection with his becoming a member of our Board of Directors, was granted options to purchase 291 shares of our common stock under our 2008 Stock Incentive Plan at an exercise price of $1,000, all of which remained outstanding as of June 30, 2009. 97 Table of Contents Executive compensation The following table sets forth the compensation earned by the Company's directors in respect of their services as such during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009: Name Option Awards (1)(2) $ Michael E.

We will adopt a written related party transaction policy, which will become effective upon our listing on the NYSE.

For purposes of the policy, related persons will include our directors, executive officers, 5% or greater stockholders and parties related to the foregoing, such as immediate family members and entities they control. In reviewing such transactions, the policy will require the Audit Committee to consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to the Audit Committee. In addition, the policy will delegate to the chair of the Audit Committee the authority to pre-approve or ratify any transaction with a related person in which the aggregate amount involved is expected to be less than $1,000,000. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The following is a description of transactions since July 1, 2006 to which we have been a party, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

This summary description does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive Securityholders Agreement, a copy of which has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the registration statement related to this offering. Transfer Restrictions. Subject to certain limited exceptions, each of the securityholders party to the Securityholders Agreement other than the Aurora Entities has agreed that, without the consent of the Aurora Entities, he, she or it will not transfer an amount of our securities that would exceed the lesser of the volume limitations set forth in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of Rule 144(e)(1) of the Securities Act, regardless of whether such transfer or such securities are otherwise subject to Rule 144. Proxy and Voting Arrangements. Each of the securityholders party to the Securityholders Agreement (other than the Aurora Entities and General Electric Pension Trust, or GEPT) has granted an irrevocable proxy to the Aurora Entities with respect to all shares of our common stock owned by such securityholder from time to time. With certain limited exceptions, GEPT has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock held by GEPT from time to time in the same manner as the Aurora Entities vote their shares of our common stock. As a result of the Securityholders Agreement, the Aurora Entities control the vote with respect to 100% of our common stock prior to this offering. Shares of our common stock are to be released from the proxy and voting agreement when they are no 103 Table of Contents Certain relationships and related party transactions longer owned beneficially or of record by the securityholder party to the Securityholders Agreement or any of his, her or its permitted transferees as defined in the Securityholders Agreement.

In addition, at any time after nine months following the consummation of this offering, any securityholder that is a holder of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock shall be entitled to demand the registration of its shares, subject to customary restrictions. We will bear all expenses incident to any such registrations, including the fees and expenses of a single counsel retained by the selling stockholders; however, each selling stockholder will be responsible for the underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes in connection with shares sold by such stockholder.

Management services agreement The following is a summary description of the principal terms of the Management Services Agreement dated as of May 28, 2008, among us, AMP and our wholly-owned subsidiary, NuCO 2 Florida Inc. This summary description does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive Management Services Agreement, a copy of which has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the registration statement related to this offering. Services. Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, AMP provides us with consultation and advice in fields such as financial services, accounting, general business management, acquisitions, dispositions and banking. Fees and Expenses. In return for such services, AMP receives a services fee in an aggregate amount equal to $1 million per annum, to be paid quarterly in advance on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each applicable year. 104 Table of Contents Certain relationships and related party transactions In addition to the services fee, AMP is entitled to receive a transaction fee equal to 2.0% of the aggregate of any acquisition or disposition consideration (including debt assumed by a purchaser and current assets retained by a seller) with respect to (i) any acquisition, (ii) any sale or disposition of any of our divisions, (iii) any sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or (iv) any other sale of any of our assets other than in the ordinary course of business. During 2008, and 2009, pursuant to this provision, we paid transaction fees to AMP of $9.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The Management Services Agreement also requires us to reimburse AMP for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by AMP in connection with the performance of their obligations under the Management Services Agreement. During 2008 and 2009, pursuant to this provision, we reimbursed AMP $2.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Indemnification. The Management Services Agreement also provides that the Company will provide AMP and its respective partners, members, officers, employees, agents and affiliates and the stockholders, partners, members, affiliates, directors, officers and employees of any of the foregoing with customary indemnification. Termination. Unless earlier terminated for cause, the Management Services Agreement terminates automatically on the earlier to occur of (i) the sale of all of our outstanding capital stock, (ii) the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, (iii) a merger involving us or the sale in one or a series of related transactions of our outstanding capital stock after which the holders of a majority of our voting power immediately prior to such merger or stock sale do not, immediately after such merger or stock sale, hold a majority of the voting power of the surviving corporation or us, as the case may be or (iv) May 28, 2018. Amendment and Restatement. In connection with the consummation of this offering, we intend to amend and restate the Management Services Agreement. Pursuant to this amendment and restatement, we plan to amend the term for which AMP will provide such services until the earlier of May 28, 2018 and such time as AMP, together with its affiliates, collectively holds less than 5% of our outstanding common stock, while eliminating all other termination events. Additionally, we plan to eliminate the provision pursuant to which we are obligated to pay to AMP an annual management fee, as well as the provision in which we are obligated to pay to AMP a transaction fee in certain circumstances. In connection therewith we will pay to AMP an aggregate one-time fee of approximately $ million upon the consummation of this offering. We also intend to modify the expense reimbursement provisions to include reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with SEC filings made with respect to our securities. Those of our directors employed by AMP will not receive any additional compensation in connection with their provision of services under the Management Services Agreement. Redemption of series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock that are currently outstanding, at a redemption price of $ per share of Series A preferred stock and $ per share of Series B preferred stock, which includes all accrued and unpaid dividends. See "Use of proceeds." Other transactions We paid the law firm of Olshan Grundman Frome Rosenzweig & Wolosky LLP approximately $122,000 in fees in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Robert L. Frome, a member of the law firm, was one of our directors at that time. 105 Table of Contents Certain relationships and related party transactions Indemnification agreements In addition to the indemnification to be provided by our new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws, we are currently party to indemnification agreements with Messrs. DeDomenico, Vipond and Wechsler, and prior to the consummation of this offering, we will enter into agreements to indemnify our directors and our other executive officers. The current agreements require us to, and the agreements to be entered into prior to the consummation of this offering will require us to, subject to certain exceptions, among other things, indemnify these directors and executive officers for certain expenses, including attorney fees, witness fees and expenses, expenses of accountants and other advisors, and the premium, security for and other costs relating to any bond, arising out of that person's services as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request. 106 Table of Contents Description of capital stock The following is a description of the material provisions of our capital stock, the other material terms of our new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws, our forms of indemnification agreement and certain provisions of Delaware law. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the relevant provisions of our new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws and our forms of indemnification agreement, copies of which will be filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement related to this offering. AUTHORIZED CAPITAL Upon the consummation of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of which shares will be issued and outstanding prior to the consummation of this offering, and shares of preferred stock. The shares of Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock currently outstanding will be redeemed concurrent with the consummation of this offering. Upon consummation of this offering, an aggregate of shares of common stock will be reserved for issuance under our 2008 Stock Incentive Plan and our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan. Assuming the for one stock split had already occurred, as of , 2010, there were shares of common stock outstanding held by stockholders of record. COMMON STOCK Voting Except as otherwise required by Delaware law, at every annual or special meeting of stockholders, every holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors. Dividends rights Subject to dividend preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. See "Dividend policy." Liquidation and preemptive rights In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. The holders of our common stock have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock. The outstanding shares of our common stock are, and the shares offered in this offering, when issued and paid for, will be, fully paid and non-assessable. Listing We intend to apply to list our common stock on the NYSE under the symbol "NUCO." Transfer agent and registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is . 107 Table of Contents Description of capital stock PREFERRED STOCK The shares of Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock that are currently outstanding will be redeemed concurrent with the consummation of this offering. Following the offering, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue not more than an aggregate of shares of preferred stock in one or more series, without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors is authorized to establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each series of preferred stock, and to fix the designation, powers, privileges, preferences, and relative participating, optional or other rights, if any, of the shares of each series of preferred stock, and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. Our board of directors also is able to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that series of preferred stock then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. In the future, our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock, or that could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of our preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other consequences, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control and might harm the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS OF OUR NEW CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND NEW BYLAWS Some provisions in our new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer, or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include: Election and removal of directors Our new certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our Board of Directors into three classes of the same or nearly the same number of directors, with staggered three-year terms. In addition, the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock will not be entitled to cumulative voting in connection with the election of our directors. Our directors will also not be subject to removal, except for cause and only by the vote of at least 66 2 / 3 % of our outstanding shares of common stock, prior to the expiration of their term. These provisions could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from acquiring, control of us. Stockholder action; special meeting of stockholders Our new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws provide that all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting and may not be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. All stockholder action must be properly brought before any stockholder meeting, which requires advance notice pursuant to the provisions of our new bylaws. In addition, special stockholder meetings may only be called by a majority of our Board of Directors. These provisions could have the effect of delaying stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities until a meeting is called. These provisions could also discourage a potential acquiror from 108 Table of Contents Description of capital stock making a tender offer for our common stock, because even if it were able to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting securities, a potential acquiror would only be able to take actions such as electing new directors or approving a business combination or merger at a duly called stockholders' meeting, and not by written consent. Authorized but unissued shares The authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the NYSE. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans and could also be issued in order to deter or prevent an attempt to acquire us. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. Super-majority voting Our new certificate of incorporation requires a super-majority vote of the holders of our outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal certain provisions of our new certificate of incorporation including provisions which would eliminate or modify the provisions described above, reduce or eliminate the number of authorized common or preferred shares and all indemnification provisions. Our new bylaws may be amended or repealed by a super-majority vote of the holders of our outstanding voting stock. DELAWARE TAKEOVER STATUTE We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any "business combination" with any "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person or entity became an interested stockholder. A "business combination" includes certain mergers, asset sales or other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to various exceptions, an "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or within the past three years has owned, 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. This provision could discourage mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts, including attempts that might result in the payment of a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock. LIMITATION OF DIRECTORS' LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION The Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors' fiduciary duties. Our new certificate of incorporation will include a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director, except for liability: > for breach of duty of loyalty; > for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law; > under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (unlawful dividends); or > for transactions from which the director derived improper personal benefit. 109 Table of Contents Description of capital stock Our new bylaws will provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law. We will be also expressly authorized to carry, and intend to obtain, directors' and officers' insurance providing indemnification for our directors, officers and certain employees for some liabilities. We believe that these indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and officers. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. In addition to the indemnification to be provided by our new certificate of incorporation and new bylaws, we are currently party to indemnification agreements with Messrs. DeDomenico, Vipond and Wechsler, and prior to the consummation of this offering, we will enter into new agreements to indemnify our directors and our other executive officers. The current agreements require us to, and the agreements to be entered into prior to the consummation of this offering will require us to, subject to certain exceptions, among other things, indemnify these directors and executive officers for certain expenses, including attorney fees, witness fees and expenses, expenses of accountants and other advisors, and the premium, security for and other costs relating to any bond, arising out of that person's services as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request. There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought. 110 Shares eligible for future sale Prior to the consummation of this offering, there has not been a public market for our common stock since the Acquisition in 2008. As described below, only a limited number of shares currently outstanding will be available for sale immediately after this offering due to contractual and legal restrictions on resale. Nevertheless, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options, in the public market after the restrictions lapse, or the possibility of such sales, could cause the prevailing market price of our common stock to fall or impair our ability to raise equity capital in the future. Upon the consummation of this offering, we will have shares of common stock outstanding. All of the shares of our common stock sold in the offering will be freely tradable in the public market without restriction or future registration under the Securities Act with the exception of shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Shares purchased by our affiliates may not be resold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration, including the exemption under Rule 144 of the Securities Act described below. Immediately after the consummation of this offering, shares of our common stock held by existing stockholders will be restricted securities, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. These restricted securities may be sold into the public market only if the sale is registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or 701 under the Securities Act, which exemptions are summarized below. These restricted securities are also subject to the lock-up agreements described below until 180 days after the date of this prospectus. LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS In connection with this offering, our executive officers, directors and the holders of substantially all of our common stock, have agreed not to directly or indirectly sell or dispose of any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to customary exceptions in specific circumstances, without the prior written consent of the representatives. For additional information, see "Underwriting." RULE 144 In general, under Rule 144, beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, a person who is not our affiliate and has not been our affiliate at any time during the preceding three months will be entitled to sell any shares of our common stock that such person has beneficially owned for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, without regard to the volume limitations summarized below. Sales of our common stock by any such person would be subject to the availability of current public information about us if the shares to be sold were beneficially owned by such person for less than one year. In addition, under Rule 144, a person may sell shares of our common stock acquired from us immediately after the consummation of this offering, without regard to volume limitations or the availability of public information about us, if: > the person is not our affiliate and has not been our affiliate at any time during the preceding three months; and > the person has beneficially owned the shares to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates. 111 Shares eligible for future sale Beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, our affiliates who have beneficially owned shares of our common stock for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of: > 1% of the number of shares of our common stock then-outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after the consummation of this offering; and > the average weekly trading volume in our common stock on the NYSE during the four calendar weeks preceding the date of filing of a Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities Pursuant to Rule 144 with respect to the sale. Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. RULE 701 Any of our employees, officers or directors who purchased shares under a written compensatory plan or contract may be entitled to sell them in reliance on Rule 701. Rule 701 permits affiliates to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. Rule 701 further provides that non-affiliates may sell these shares in reliance on Rule 144 without complying with the holding period, public information, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares are required to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling those shares. STOCK PLANS We plan on filing a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering the shares of our common stock issued and issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under our 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, and shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan. We expect to file this registration statement after the consummation of this offering.

This summary deals only with shares of our common stock that are held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment). This summary does not discuss any state, local or foreign tax consequences and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to the purchase, ownership or disposition of our common stock by prospective investors in light of their particular circumstances. In particular, except to the extent discussed below, this summary does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: > dealers in securities or currencies, brokers, financial institutions, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, retirement plans, U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings or insurance companies; > U.S. Holders of shares of our common stock whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar; > persons holding shares of our common stock as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale, or conversion transaction or a straddle; > entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or > persons liable for alternative minimum tax consequences. The discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code applicable U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities are subject to different interpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. If a partnership holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding shares of our common stock, you should consult your tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you. If you are considering the purchase of shares of our common stock, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction. Each prospective investor should seek advice based on its particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor. For purposes of this summary, a "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of a share of our common stock that is: > an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; > a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; > an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or > a trust if (i) it is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. 113 Material United States federal income tax consequences CONSEQUENCES TO U.S. HOLDERS The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to a U.S. Holder of shares of our common stock. Dividend distributions If we make a distribution in respect of our common stock, the distribution will be treated as a dividend to the extent it is paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. If the distribution exceeds current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital reducing the holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock to the extent of the holder's adjusted tax basis in that stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain. The Code provides for special treatment of dividends paid to individual taxpayers prior to 2011. If a U.S. Holder is an individual, dividends received by such holder on or prior to December 31, 2010 generally will be subject to a reduced maximum tax rate of 15%. Beginning January 1, 2011, the rate applicable to dividends is scheduled to return to the tax rate generally applicable to ordinary income. The rate reduction will not apply to dividends received to the extent that the U.S. holder elects to treat dividends as "investment income," which may be offset by investment expense. Furthermore, the rate reduction also will not apply to dividends that are paid to a U.S. Holder unless certain holding period requirements are satisfied. If a U.S. Holder is a U.S. corporation, it may be able to claim the deduction allowed to U.S. corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations equal to a portion of any dividends received subject to generally applicable limitations on that deduction. In general, a dividend distribution to a corporate U.S. Holder may qualify for the 70% dividends received deduction if the U.S. Holder owns less than 20% of the voting power and value of our stock. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the holding period requirements that must be satisfied in order to qualify the dividends-received deduction and the reduced maximum tax rate on dividends. Sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of stock A U.S. Holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss on a sale or exchange of our common stock. The U.S. Holder's gain or loss will equal the difference between the amount realized by the U.S. Holder and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the stock. The amount realized by the U.S. Holder will include the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any other property received for the stock. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale or exchange of stock will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder held the stock for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. New healthcare legislation Under the Health Care and Reconciliation Act of 2010, certain U.S. Holders who are individuals, estates or trusts will be required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stock for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of our common stock. 114 Material United States federal income tax consequences Information reporting and backup withholding We or our paying agent must report annually to U.S. Holders (other than exempt holders) and the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, amounts paid to such holders on or with respect to our common stock during each calendar year and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from such payments. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding on dividends paid on our common stock and proceeds from the sale of our common stock at the applicable rate (which is currently 28%) if the U.S. Holder is not otherwise exempt and (i) the holder fails to provide us or our paying agent with a correct taxpayer identification number, (ii) the holder provides an incorrect taxpayer identification number, (iii) we or our paying agent are notified by the IRS that the holder is subject to backup withholding as a result of its failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends or, (iv) the holder fails to certify under penalty of perjury that it has provided a correct taxpayer identification number and has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding. A U.S. Holder generally may establish that it is exempt from or otherwise not subject to backup withholding by providing a properly completed IRS Form W-9 to us or our paying agent. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is properly furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to a Non-U.S. Holder of shares of our common stock. The term "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is an individual, corporation, estate or trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not a U.S. Holder. Dividend distributions Distributions on our common stock will constitute dividends to the extent described above in "Consequences to U.S. HoldersDividend distributions." Any dividends paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to the shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a Non-U.S. Holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a valid IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable successor form) certifying such holder's qualification for the reduced rate. This certification must be provided to us or our paying agent prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. If a Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty but fails to timely provide the required certification, the holder may obtain a refund or credit of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for such refund or credit with the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their eligibility for treaty benefits. Dividends that are effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States are not subject to U.S. withholding tax. Instead, dividends that are effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business and, where an applicable tax treaty so provides, are attributable to such Non-U.S. Holder's permanent establishment in the United States, are subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at applicable graduated individual or corporate rates. To claim the exemption from U.S. withholding tax, a Non-U.S. Holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or applicable successor form) prior to the payment of dividends. Any such effectively connected dividends received by a foreign corporation may, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% 115 Material United States federal income tax consequences rate or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty. Non-U.S. Holders should consult applicable tax treaties, which may provide for different rules. Sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of stock Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless: > that gain is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment); > the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other conditions are met; or > we are or have been a "United States real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the period that such Non-U.S. Holder held shares of our common stock and either our common stock was not regularly traded on an established securities market at any time during the calendar year in which the disposition occurs, or the Non-U.S. Holder owns or owned (actually or constructively) more than five percent of the total fair market value of shares of our common stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the date of disposition. We are not, and do not anticipate that we will become, a "U.S. real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An individual Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the net gain derived from the sale under regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates or such lower rate as specified by an applicable income tax treaty. An individual Non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above will generally be subject to a flat 30% U.S. federal income tax on the gain derived from the sale, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. If a Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty between the United States and its country of residence, any gain described in the second bullet point will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the manner specified by the treaty and generally will only be subject to such tax if such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States and the Non-U.S. Holder claims the benefit of the treaty by properly submitting an IRS Form W-8BEN (or suitable successor or substitute form). A Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation and is described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax on gain under regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates and, in addition, may be subject to a branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty. Information reporting and backup withholding We must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends or other distributions we pay to you on shares of our common stock and the amount of tax we withhold on these distributions. These information reporting requirements apply even if no withholding was required because the dividends were effectively connection with the holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business, or withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Copies of the information returns reporting such distributions and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. The United States imposes a backup withholding tax on dividends and certain other types of payments to U.S. persons. A Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding tax on dividends the holder receives on 116 Material United States federal income tax consequences shares of our common stock if the holder provides proper certification (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN) of the holder's status as a non-U.S. person or other exempt status. Information reporting and backup withholding generally are not required with respect to the amount of any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock outside the United States through a foreign office of a foreign broker that does not have certain specified connections to the United States. However, if a Non-U.S. Holder sells shares of our common stock through a U.S. broker or the U.S. office of a foreign broker, the broker will be required to report the amount of proceeds paid to the Non-U.S. Holder to the IRS and also backup withhold on that amount unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides appropriate certification (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN) to the broker of the holder's status as a non-U.S. person or other exempt status. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is properly furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. New legislation relating to foreign accounts Newly enacted legislation may impose withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to "foreign financial institutions" and certain other non-U.S. entities after December 31, 2012. The legislation imposes a 30% withholding tax on dividends on, or gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our common stock paid to a foreign financial institution unless the foreign financial institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to among other things, undertake to identify accounts held by certain U.S. persons or U.S.-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent it from complying with these reporting and other requirements. In addition, the legislation imposes a 30% withholding tax on the same types of payments to a foreign non-financial entity unless the entity certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial U.S. owner. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding this legislation. 117 Underwriting We are offering the shares of our common stock described in this prospectus through the underwriters named below. UBS Securities LLC and are the representatives of the underwriters. UBS Securities LLC and are the joint book-running managers of this offering. We have entered into an underwriting agreement with the representatives. Subject to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, each of the underwriters has severally agreed to purchase the number of shares of common stock listed next to its name in the following table. Underwriters Number of shares UBS Securities LLC Total The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters must buy all of the shares if they buy any of them. However, the underwriters are not required to take or pay for the shares covered by the underwriters' over-allotment option described below. Our common stock is offered subject to a number of conditions, including: > receipt and acceptance of our common stock by the underwriters; and > the underwriters' right to reject orders in whole or in part. We have been advised by the representatives that the underwriters intend to make a market in our common stock but that they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue making a market at any time without notice. In connection with this offering, certain of the underwriters or securities dealers may distribute prospectuses electronically. OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION We have granted the underwriters an option to buy up to an aggregate of additional shares of our common stock. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, made in connection with this offering. The underwriters have 30 days from the date of this prospectus to exercise this option. If the underwriters exercise this option, they will each purchase additional shares approximately in proportion to the amounts specified in the table above. COMMISSIONS AND DISCOUNTS Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $ per share from the initial public offering price. Sales of shares made outside of the US may be made by affiliates of the underwriters. If all the shares are not sold at the initial public offering price, the representatives may change the offering price and the other selling terms. Upon execution of the underwriting agreement, the underwriters will be obligated to purchase the shares at the prices and upon the terms stated therein. 118 Underwriting The following table shows the per share and total underwriting discounts and commissions we will pay to the underwriters assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase up to an additional shares. No exercise Full exercise Per share $ $ Total $ $ We estimate that the total expenses of this offering payable by us, not including the underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ . NO SALES OF SIMILAR SECURITIES We and our executive officers, directors and holders of substantially all of our common stock, have entered into lock-up agreements with the representatives. Under these agreements, subject to certain exceptions, we and each of these persons may not, without the prior written approval of the representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or hedge our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock. These restrictions will be in effect for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus. At any time and without public notice, the representatives may, in their sole discretion, release some or all of the securities from these lock-up agreements. INDEMNIFICATION We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act. If we are unable to provide this indemnification, we have agreed to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. NYSE QUOTATION We will apply to list our common stock for quotation on the NYSE under the trading symbol "NUCO." PRICE STABILIZATION, SHORT POSITIONS In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our common stock, including: > stabilizing transactions; > short sales; > purchases to cover positions created by short sales; > imposition of penalty bids; and > syndicate covering transactions. Stabilizing transactions consist of bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock while this offering is in progress. These transactions may also include making short sales of our common stock, which involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares of common stock than they are required to purchase in this offering and purchasing shares of common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales may be "covered short sales," which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters' over-allotment option referred to above, or may be "naked short sales," which are short positions in excess of that amount. 119 Underwriting The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their over-allotment option, in whole or in part, or by purchasing shares in the open market. In making this determination, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. Naked short sales are in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchased in this offering. The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of that underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. As a result of these activities, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the underwriters at any time. The underwriters may carry out these transactions on the NYSE, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE Immediately prior to this offering, there was no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiation by us and the representatives of the underwriters. The principal factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price include: > the information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to representatives; > our history and prospects and the history of and prospects for the industry in which we compete; > our past and present financial performance and an assessment of our management; > our prospects for future earnings and the present state of our development; > the general condition of the securities markets at the time of this offering; > the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded common stock of generally comparable companies; and > other factors deemed relevant by the underwriters and us. AFFILIATIONS The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have in the past provided, are currently providing and may in the future from time to time provide, investment banking and other financing, trading, banking, research, transfer agent and trustee services to us or our subsidiaries, for which they have in the past received, and may currently or in the future receive, customary fees and expenses.

(Predecessor Company) for the period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 and for the year ended June 30, 2007. Our audits also include the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 16(b). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries at June 30, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, the consolidated results of NuCO 2 Florida Inc.'s (Predecessor Company) operations and cash flows for the period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 and for the year ended June 30, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

F-9 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2009 1. Description of business NuCO 2 Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Successor Company") believes it is the leading provider of bulk CO 2 equipment and distributor of bulk CO 2 to quick service restaurants and other customers in the United States based on bulk CO 2 equipment leased to customers. CO 2 is the necessary ingredient for beverage carbonation, which is a key component of fountain beverages. As of June 30, 2009, the Company operated a national network of 138 service locations (122 stationary and 16 mobile) servicing approximately 129,000 customer locations in 48 states. Currently, virtually all fountain beverage providers in the continental United States are within the Company's service area. The Company has entered into Master Service Agreements with many operators, including 121 restaurant and convenience store concepts that provide fountain beverages. These Master Service Agreements generally provide for a commitment by the operator to use the Company's services for all of its currently owned locations and may also include future locations. The Company currently services approximately 67,000 chain and franchisee locations that have signed Master Service Agreements. The Company is actively working on expanding the number of Master Service Agreements with numerous restaurant chains. Included in the customer count at June 30, 2009, are customer locations acquired from nexAir, LLC (the "nexAir Acquisition") on December 31, 2008 (see Note 4). The Company is principally owned by Aurora Equity Partners III, L.P. ("Aurora"), who holds approximately 73% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. Aurora is an affiliate of Aurora Capital Group, a Los Angeles based private equity firm. NuCO 2 Inc. changed its name from NuCO 2 Parent Inc. effective April 8, 2010 and all references throughout these accompanying consolidated financial statements have reflected such name change.

(a wholly owned subsidiary of NuCO 2 Inc.) changed its name from NuCO 2 Inc. effective April 16, 2010 and all references throughout these accompanying consolidated financial statements have reflected such name change. 2. Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") and include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. On May 28, 2008, NuCO 2 Florida Inc. (the "Predecessor Company") completed a merger (the "Merger and Acquisition") with the Company and NuCO 2 Merger Co., a Florida corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), under which Merger Sub merged with and into the Predecessor Company with the Predecessor Company surviving the Merger and Acquisition as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2009 and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2009 reflect the Merger and Acquisition and are defined as those of the Successor Company. The consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2009 also reflects the preliminary allocation of the purchase price relating to the nexAir Acquisition. The consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 after the F-10 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 Merger and Acquisition are also defined as those of the Successor Company and are referred to as the "period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008." The consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the period July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 are those of the Predecessor Company and are referred to as the "period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008." The consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2007 are those of the Predecessor Company and are referred to as the "year ended June 30, 2007". In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance, codifying US GAAP as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental US GAAP, known as Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC" or the "Codification"). Under FASB ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, US GAAP does not change, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative US GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. All previously existing accounting standards documents were superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the FASB Codification is considered non-authoritative. These provisions of FASB ASC Topic 105 were effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. However, the Company has adopted these provisions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2009. The adoption of the Codification did not have an impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations, but does impact its financial reports by eliminating all references to pre-codification standards and replacing them with Codification references. 3. Securitization transaction and merger and acquisition On May 28, 2008 the Company completed the Merger and Acquisition. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger and Acquisition, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Predecessor Company (other than treasury shares, shares owned by the Company, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) were converted automatically into the right to receive $30.00 in cash. The Successor Company, under its articles of incorporation, is authorized to issue 200,000 common shares, at $.01 par value. At June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, there were 119,837 and 99,772 common shares issued and outstanding, respectively. Also, the Company is authorized to issue a total of 15,000 shares of preferred stock at $.01 par value, of which 11,983 shares and 9,997 were issued and outstanding at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and divided into two tranches- Series A and Series B . (see Note 15) In connection with the Merger and Acquisition, the Company engaged in a whole business securitization (the "Securitization Transaction"), the purpose of which was to secure debt financing with the assets of the Company. As part of the Securitization Transaction, the Successor Company and certain of the Company's subsidiaries, issued debt (the "Securitization Offering") in the aggregate amount of $355.0 million, which consisted of $280.0 million of Fixed Rate Series 2008-1 Senior Notes and $75.0 million of Fixed Rate Series 2008-1 Subordinated Notes (the "Series 2008-1 Notes") (see Note 10). F-11 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 In connection with the Securitization Transaction, the Successor Company formed the following five limited purpose Delaware limited liability companies: > NuCO 2 Funding LLC ("Master Issuer") > NuCO 2 LLC ("Contract Holder") > NuCO 2 Supply LLC ("Equipment Holder") > NuCO 2 IP LLC ("IP Holder") > NuCO 2 Management LLC ("Employee Company") The Master Issuer and the Employee Company are each direct wholly owned subsidiaries of NuCO 2 Florida Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Master Issuer owns 100% of the preferred equity interests in the Employee Company. The Contract Holder, the Equipment Holder and the IP Holder are each direct wholly owned subsidiaries of the Master Issuer and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. On May 28, 2008, NuCO 2, Florida Inc. contributed to the Master Issuer substantially all its assets (other than excluded assets) which included the following: (i) all existing customer contracts; (ii) all contract revenue streams; (iii) all existing supply contracts; (iv) all existing real estate leases; (v) use and occupancy licenses with respect to any existing real estate leases; (vi) all existing delivery truck leases; (vii) all existing equipment; (viii) the preferred equity interests in the Employee Company; F-12 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 (ix) the concentration account; (x) all existing securitization intellectual properties and (xi) all products and proceeds of the foregoing. The table below summarizes the structure of the Successor Company: On May 28, 2008, the Company distributed the proceeds received from the Securitization Transaction of $328.3 million (net of $26.7 million discount) along with $199.5 million of proceeds from the sale of 99,772 shares of common stock and 9,977 shares of Series A preferred and $0.8 million received for future share issuances, from outside investors, including Aurora, and used such proceeds to purchase the outstanding shares and outstanding employee options of the Predecessor Company. The $0.8 million received for future share issuances is classified in accrued expenses at June 30, 2008, as the shares were not issued until September 2008. As part of this Merger and Acquisition transaction, the Company purchased 14,813,495 outstanding shares of common stock at $30 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $444.4 million. The Company also purchased all employee options, which were equal to 1,867,107 shares, for approximately $17.6 million (net of proceeds of $38.5 million). For the period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008, the Predecessor Company recognized additional stock compensation expense of $1.2 million in its results of operations as a result of the accelerated vesting of those options. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC Topic 805"), the Merger and Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under this method of F-13 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded on the Successor Company's balance sheet at their estimated fair value. As a result of the Merger and Acquisition and the consideration paid, $242.4 million of goodwill was recorded on the consolidated balance sheet of the Successor Company. The main drivers of the goodwill were the Company's historical revenue growth rate, as well as expectations for future revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and growth from organic and strategic initiatives including synergies arising from the transaction. These expectations of future business performance were key factors influencing the premium paid for the business. The goodwill associated with this Merger and Acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, during the year ended June 30, 2009, shareholders of the Company, including Aurora, contributed $39.1 million of additional capital to the Company related to the nexAir acquisition (see Note 4), which resulted in additional preliminary goodwill of $13.4 million being recorded on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company. The table below represents the final allocation of the purchase price for the Merger and Acquisition, which occurred on May 28, 2008, in thousands: Assets: Cash and restricted cash $ 20,510 Other current assets 16,433 Property and equipment 157,524 Deferred financing fees 20,363 Customer lists 146,800 Other intangible assets 23,830 Goodwill 242,370 Other assets 301 Total assets acquired 628,131 Liabilities: Current liabilities 24,385 Deposits 4,355 Deferred tax liability 70,809 Total liabilities assumed 99,549 Net assets acquired $ 528,582 Purchase price: Cash $ 200,312 Long-term debt 328,270 Purchase price $ 528,582 4. Acquisition of beverage carbonation business of nexAir, LLC On December 31, 2008, the Company acquired the beverage carbonation segment of nexAir, LLC for approximately $44.4 million in cash subject to a potential purchase price adjustment of $2.5 million held in escrow, pending a final reconciliation of customer and equipment counts. More specifically, the F-14 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 purchase included customer accounts and related assets and required hiring certain operational employees of nexAir, LLC. The transaction did not require hiring any administrative employees. Based in Memphis, TN, nexAir, LLC's beverage carbonation business primarily spans 15 mid-south states and is complementary to the Company's existing markets. These factors, and others, contributed to the recognition of goodwill of approximately $13.4 million, all of which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Revenues and expenses of nexAir, LLC are included in the Company's results of operations from the date of acquisition. The acquisition was not significant to the Company and, accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, the nexAir Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The valuation analysis is preliminary and is subject to change pending the final outcome of a valuation analysis. The allocation period will not extend past one year from the date the nexAir Acquisition was consummated, or December 31, 2009. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the nexAir Acquisition as of June 30, 2009 is as follows: Purchase price allocation (In thousands) Property and equipment $ 13,253 Customer lists 16,100 Non-compete agreement 1,600 Goodwill 13,437 Total assets acquired $ 44,390 In connection with the nexAir Acquisition, the Company borrowed $5.3 million under its equipment revolver. Additionally, shareholders of the Company contributed approximately $39.1 million to the Company to fund the nexAir Acquisition. 5. Summary of significant accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances with a financial institution in an amount that exceeds the federal government deposit insurance. Restricted cash The Company classifies restricted cash as all cash pledged as collateral to secure certain obligations and all cash whose use is limited. This includes cash held in escrow to fund interest payments on the Company's Series 2008-1 Notes and other trustee expenses related to the Merger and Acquisition. All of the Company's cash balances are insured through various U.S. government agencies. Restricted cash also includes $2.5 million of monies escrowed related to the nexAir Acquisition. F-15 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 Revenue recognition Revenue from sales of bulk CO 2 and other gases is recognized when the product is shipped, a sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Rental fees on bulk CO 2 storage tanks and other equipment are recognized when earned. For contracts that contain multiple deliverables, principally product supply agreements for bulk CO 2 and equipment rental, revenue is recognized under guidance from FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ("ASC Topic 605") for certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities. The Company's bulk CO 2 budget plan agreements provide for a fixed monthly payment to cover the use of a bulk CO 2 system and a predetermined maximum quantity of CO 2 . As of June 30, 2009, approximately 69,000 of the Company's customer locations utilized this plan. Under the budget plan agreement, customers are billed an equal monthly amount which includes CO 2 up to an annual allowance. The contract arrangement for budget plan customers is analogous to a "take-or-pay" contract as defined under guidance from FASB ASC Topic 440, Commitments ("ASC Topic 440"), as the budget plan customer must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services. Each budget plan customer has a maximum CO 2 allowance that is measured and reset on the contract anniversary date. Because of the large number of customers under the budget plan agreement and the fact that the anniversary dates for determining maximum quantities are spread throughout the year, the Company's methodology for applying revenue recognition involves the use of estimates and assumptions to separate revenues derived from equipment rentals versus revenues from CO 2 sales. The following table segregates revenue streams between revenues attributable to equipment rentals and revenues from sales of CO 2 and other gases for the following periods; Successor company Predecessor company Revenue stream Year ended June 30, 2009 Period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 Period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 Year ended June 30, 2007 CO 2 and other gases $ 100,628 $ 8,275 $ 83,901 $ 85,865 Equipment rentals 55,497 4,193 43,366 44,263 Total revenues $ 156,125 $ 12,468 $ 127,267 $ 130,128 Deferred revenue During the year ended June 30, 2009, the Company began invoicing selected customers generally on the fifteenth day of each month for services to be provided during the subsequent month. As a result, the Company records deferred revenue in its consolidated balance sheet upon receipt of cash on these invoices prior to the month to which they relate. The revenue related to these billings is recorded during the month in which the services are provided. Deferred revenue at June 30, 2009 amounted to $1.3 million, which is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. F-16 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 Trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts The Company recognizes trade receivables when it invoices its customers on a monthly basis, with payment generally due within 30 days of the invoice date. The Company does not provide discounts for early payment. The Company has established a reserve for trade receivables that might not be collectible. Such reserve is evaluated and adjusted on a monthly basis by examining the Company's historical losses, aging of its trade receivables, the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing evaluations, and current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. The composition of receivables consists of on-time payers, "slow" payers, and at risk receivables, such as receivables from customers who no longer do business with the Company, are bankrupt, or are out of business. The Company maintains a policy for charging off uncollectible trade receivables against the reserve after exhausting all collection efforts and determining that the account is uncollectible. Inventories Inventories, applied on a consistent basis, consist primarily of carbon dioxide gas, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lives of the related leases or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. The Company has a wide range of estimated useful lives of property and equipment because the useful lives of acquired equipment from various acquisitions are generally less than newly purchased assets acquired in the ordinary course of business. Repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are generally expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Estimated life Leased equipment 120 years Equipment and cylinders 120 years Vehicles 15 years Computer equipment and software 15 years Office furniture and fixtures 17 years Leasehold improvements lease term The Company does not depreciate bulk systems held for installation until the systems are ready for their intended use and leased to customers. Upon installation, the systems, component parts and direct costs associated with the installation are transferred to the leased equipment account. These direct costs are associated with successful placements of such systems with customers under noncancelable contracts, which would not be incurred by the Company but for a successful placement, and they are amortized over the life of the original customer contract. Upon early service termination, the unamortized portion of direct costs associated with the installation are recognized as a period expense in the statements of operations. Such policy is analogous to FASB ASC Topic 310, Receivables , related F-17 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 to the accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases. Refurbishment costs The Company's tanks require vacuum refurbishment, every seven to ten years, to maintain effective operation of the tanks for the expected useful life of the tanks of 20 years. Such refurbishment is considered to be an overhaul to extend the useful life of the assets as compared to a minor maintenance activity. The Predecessor Company previously expensed such costs as a period expense. In connection with the Merger and Acquisition, the Successor Company began capitalizing costs directly related to the refurbishment of existing tanks and is amortizing these costs over the estimated remaining life of the refurbishment, or seven years. The Company recorded approximately $4.4 million of capitalized refurbishment costs, which is included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet, and recognized related depreciation expense of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2009. Costs of computer software obtained for internal use The Company is currently in the process of implementing an enterprise resource planning ("ERP") software package to coordinate all the resources, information, and activities needed to complete business processes. The Company accounts for such costs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC Topic 350") as it relates to accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use. Under such guidance, certain costs incurred during the application development stage should be capitalized. During the year ended June 30, 2009, the Company capitalized approximately $1.5 million of costs associated with the new ERP software, which is included in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, and approximately $0.6 million of such costs were expensed. There were no costs incurred in the prior periods. Amortization of capitalized costs is expected to occur when the implementation is substantially complete and the Company is in a "go-live" status. The Company anticipates an increase in capitalized ERP costs over the next two quarters of fiscal year 2010 as the software implementation is completed. Segment reporting Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or decision making group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has determined that it has one reportable business segment, the distribution of services related to the storage, bending and dispensing of bulk CO 2 equipment and bulk CO 2 gases to a single customer base. The Company's chief operating decision maker reviews financial information of the Company as a whole for purposes of assessing financial performance and making operating decisions. Accordingly, the Company considers itself to be operating in a single industry segment. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the Company for all transactions accounted for as business combinations. F-18 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill at least annually (at December 31) to assess impairment since this asset is not amortized. Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill or any intangible asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company assesses impairment by comparing the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value. Specifically, the Company tests for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350. ASC Topic 350 also requires that goodwill be assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment. The Company has previously determined that in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting , that it has only one reportable segment and one reporting unit. For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired. The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over the asset's implied fair value. Impairments are expensed when incurred. The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment for all periods presented. Also, under ASC Topic 350, the Company reviews, on an annual basis, the carrying value of its other indefinite-lived intangible asset, trade names, for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators are present, then the Company may perform additional analysis, such as discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals, to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value estimate. Impairment is then measured and the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value is expensed. The Company did not recognize any impairment for its trade names for all periods presented. Other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized on a straight-line method over the periods of expected benefit. The Company's other finite-lived intangible assets consist of customer lists, proprietary technology, and non-competition agreements. Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, consist of property and equipment, customer lists, proprietary technology, and non-competition agreements. Under FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment , long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment losses are recognized only if the carrying amounts of long-lived assets are deemed to be not recoverable and exceed the asset's fair values. The impairment loss would be calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value of the asset with fair value generally estimated based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows relating thereto. There was no indication of impairment for any periods presented. Deferred financing cost, net The Company's financing costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the related indebtedness. Such amortized costs are included in interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred deferred financing costs of approximately $0.5 million and $17.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, respectively, in connection with the Securitization Transaction. F-19 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 There were no such costs for the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008. Deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 were $16.7 million and $19.6 million, respectively. Deferred lease acquisition costs, net Deferred lease acquisition costs consist of commissions associated with the acquisition of new leases and lease renewals and are being amortized on a straight-line method over the life of the related leases. Deferred lease acquisition costs, net of accumulated amortization at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 were $2.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Income taxes and other Income taxes are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC Topic 740"), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Under ASC Topic 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. ASC Topic 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. It also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties. Under ASC Topic 740, the Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expense. The Company collects sales tax and property tax amounts due to governmental authorities from its customers. These payments are remitted to the appropriate taxing authority and recorded in the Company's statements of operations on a net basis. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates used when accounting for items such as allowances for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization periods, valuation of goodwill, long-lived assets and income taxes are regarded by management as being particularly significant. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and may require adjustment in the near term and, as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Share-based compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, CompensationStock Compensation ("ASC Topic 718"). After assessing alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions, the Company is using the Black-Scholes valuation model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grants. The Successor Company estimates a zero percent forfeitures rate in its expense calculations as grants have F-20 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 been limited to select management personnel only and forfeiture history has been minor. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Company presents the excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees ("ASC Topic 505"). Employee benefit plan On June 1, 1996, the Predecessor Company adopted a deferred compensation plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers all eligible employees, and was transferred to the Successor Company. Under the provisions of the plan, eligible employees may defer a percentage of their compensation subject to the Internal Revenue Service limits. Contributions to the plan are made by employees and matched at the Company's discretion, up to a maximum of 2% of employee's wages. The Company contributed $0.3 million, $0.03 million, $0.15 million, and $0.12 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, for the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008, and for the Predecessor Company year ended June 30, 2007, respectively, and recorded these expenses in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 6. Recent accounting pronouncements In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13 ("ASU 2009-13"), Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force . ASU 2009-13 applies to all entities who are vendors that enter into multiple-deliverable arrangements with their customers. ASU 2009-13 provides amendments to the criteria in ASC Topic 605 for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements, establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, and eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires the relative selling price method in allocating discounts. This update also expands disclosures related to a vendor's multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU-2009-13 will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2009-13 will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-05 ("ASU 2009-05"), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value . ASU 2009-05 applies to all entities that measure liabilities at fair value within the scope of ASC Topic 820. ASU 2009-05 provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques: 1.) A valuation technique that uses: a. The quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset. b. Quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets. 2.) Another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of ASC Topic 820. Two examples would be an income approach, such as a technique that is based on the amount at F-21 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 the measurement date that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability. The amendments in ASU 2009-5 also clarify that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. It also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair value measurements. The guidance provided in ASU 2009-5 will become effective for the Company in fiscal year 2010. However, because the Company does not currently have any liabilities that are recorded at fair value, the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-04 ("ASU 2009-04"), Accounting for Redeemable Equity InstrumentsAmendment to Section 480-10-S99 . ASU 2009-04 represents an update to Section 480-10-S99, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, per EITF Topic D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. This update is an SEC staff announcement that provides the SEC staff's views regarding the application of Accounting Series Release No. 268, Presentation in Financial Statements of "Redeemable Preferred Stocks" ("ASR 268"). ASR 268 requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside permanent equity if they are redeemable 1) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, 2) at the option of the holder, or 3) upon occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. The Company has determined that, because of certain redemption features included in its Series A and Series B preferred stock issuances (see Note 15) are not within the control of the Company, such securities should be classified as temporary equity on the accompanying balance sheets. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events ("ASC Topic 855"), which modifies current guidance in the auditing literature of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA"), Auditing Standards (AU) Section 560, and is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The guidance is largely similar to the current guidance in such auditing literature with some exceptions that are not intended to result in significant changes in practice. ASC Topic 855 applies to all entities that prepare financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. It defines subsequent events either as "recognized" or "non-recognized" subsequent events and refers to events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. ASC Topic 855 requires entities to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 855 as of June 30, 2009 and evaluated the impact of material subsequent events through the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were issued. No recognized or non-recognized subsequent events were identified requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements ("ASC Topic 820") in a market that is not active and illustrates key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for the financial asset is not active. The guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. F-22 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 In April 2008, the FASB issued guidance now codified under ASC Topic 350, which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of ASC Topic 350 will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In February 2008, the FASB issued guidance now codified under ASC Topic 820, which delayed the effective date of disclosure for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of ASC Topic 820 will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC Topic 805"). ASC Topic 805 requires, among other things, the expensing of direct transaction costs, including deal costs and restructuring costs as incurred, research and development assets acquired in a business combination to be capitalized, certain contingent assets and liabilities to be recognized at fair value, and earn-out arrangements, including contingent consideration, that may be required to be measured at fair value until settled, with changes in fair value recognized each period into earnings. ASC Topic 805 became effective for the Company on July 1, 2009 and could have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows if, and when, the Company completes significant asset and/or business acquisitions. In February 2007, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments ("ASC Topic 825"). ASC Topic 825 permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, arising subsequent to the adoption of fair value measurement, are reported in earnings. ASC Topic 825 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. ASC Topic 825 became effective for the Company on July 1, 2008, and the Company did not elect the fair value option under this standard. 7.

Also included in leased equipment are refurbishment costs of $4.4 million at June 30, 2009. As noted earlier, the Predecessor Company previously expensed such costs as a period expense. Accumulated depreciation and amortization of these costs was $9.4 million and $0.3 million at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. Upon early service termination, the Company writes off the remaining net book value of costs associated with the installation of equipment. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment was $25.4 million, $1.8 million, $15.6 million, and $16.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, for the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008, and for the Predecessor Company year ended June 30, 2007, respectively. 8. Goodwill and other intangible assets The Company recognized goodwill of $255.8 million, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, related to both the Merger and Acquisition and nexAir Acquisition. Information regarding the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets is as follows: Cost Accumulated amortization Net book value (In thousands) As of June 30, 2009: Goodwill $ 255,808 $  $ 255,808 Customer lists 162,900 8,349 154,551 Other intangible assets: Trade names 22,000  22,000 Proprietary technology 1,700 368 1,332 Non-compete agreements 1,730 330 1,400 25,430 698 24,732 $ 444,138 $ 9,047 $ 435,091 As of June 30, 2008: Goodwill $ 342,795 $  $ 342,795 Customer lists 5,323 76 5,247 Non-compete agreements 130 27 103 $ 348,248 $ 103 $ 348,145 The carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets as it relates to the nexAir Acquisition are based on the preliminary purchase price valuation and are subject to change pending the final outcome of the valuation analyses. All intangible assets subject to amortization are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from five to twenty years. Amortization expense for intangible assets, other than goodwill and trade names, was $9.0 million, $0.3 million, $3.0 million and $3.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, for the period from F-24 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, for the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008, and for the Predecessor Company year ended June 30, 2007, respectively. The weighted-average amortization period for other intangible assets and customer lists is 5 years and 20 years, respectively. The total weighted-average amortization for all amortizable intangible assets is 19.7 years. Estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is $8.8 million, $8.8 million, $8.8 million, $8.8 million, and $8.3 million for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. 9. Leases The Company leases equipment to its customers pursuant non-cancelable operating leases, generally ranging from four to six years, which expire on varying dates through June 2016. At June 30, 2009, future minimum payments are from customers on various rental plans that include, where applicable, amounts for a continuous supply of CO 2 under the budget plan agreement, which provides bundled pricing for tank rental and CO 2 . The revenue stream has been segregated in conformity with ASC Topic 440 between the estimated rental of equipment and the sale of CO 2 . Escalation clauses in all rental plans, if any, are tied to various future industry and economic indexes and are not included in the following table that presents the separate, future minimum revenue streams attributable to the lease of the equipment and the sale of the CO 2 for the years ended June 30: Equipment CO 2 (In thousands) 2010 $ 42,406 $ 29,469 2011 33,507 23,284 2012 24,789 17,226 2013 16,757 11,645 2014 9,964 6,924 Thereafter 3,046 2,117 $ 130,469 $ 90,665 10.

In order to finance a portion of the consideration payable to the shareholders of the Predecessor Company, the Successor Company engaged in a whole business Securitization Transaction wherein the Master Issuer issued 2008-1 Class A-1 Senior Term Notes and 2008-1 Class B-1 Subordinated Notes (collectively the "Series 2008-1 Notes"). The Series 2008-1 Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer. The notes are structured with a five-year interest only period and are due in full upon maturity at June 25, 2013 unless extended by the Company. There are no required principal payments prior to that date as long as the Company is not in default of its covenants. The extension may be for two, one-year periods. If the extension is elected, the notes become floating-rate based, with the 2008-1 Class A-1 Senior Term Notes adjusting to a rate of LIBOR plus 7%, and the 2008-1 Class B-1 Subordinated Notes having a new rate of LIBOR plus 11%. On May 28, 2008, the Company also issued a class of senior floating rate asset backed variable funding notes with five-year terms to fund working capital (the "Senior Working Capital Revolver") in the amount of up to $20.0 million, with an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.5%. At June 30, 2009, the Company had no borrowings against the Senior Working Capital Revolver. The interest rate on the Senior Working Capital Revolver at June 30, 2009 was 4.8% per annum. On May 28, 2008, the Company also entered into a 5-year floating rate revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of future bulk CO 2 equipment (the "Equipment Revolver") in the amount of up to $30.0 million with an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.5%. At June 30, 2009, the Company had borrowings of approximately $6.8 million drawn against the Equipment Revolver. At June 30, 2008 the Company had no borrowings against the Equipment Revolver. The Company is required to make monthly principal payments on the Equipment Revolver in an amount equal to, at a minimum, the difference, if any, between the amount outstanding and the applicable borrowing base amount of eligible equipment. The interest rate on the Equipment Revolver at June 30, 2009 was 4.8% per annum. The Senior Working Capital Revolver and the Equipment Revolver are subject to a 1.5% annual unused commitment fee, which is payable monthly, under the terms of the debt agreement. The Company recorded commitment fee expenses of $0.7 million and $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, respectively, which is included in interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Series 2008-1 Notes were issued at a discount of approximately $26.7 million, which is being amortized over the life of the notes using the effective interest method. The Company recorded amortization expense of $4.4 million and $0.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, respectively, which is included in interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Under the terms of the May 28, 2008 Series 2008-1 Note Agreements, the Company is required to comply with certain weekly and monthly cash restrictions and other criteria. Additionally, the Company must issue weekly and monthly manager reports to facilitate the manager's assessment that certain compliance measures are maintained. One single financial covenant governs compliance for all the Company's debt, including the Company's revolving debt facilities, and requires that the Company maintain a three month Debt Service Coverage Ratio ("DSCR") of not lower than 1.20. The DSCR is F-26 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 calculated by dividing adjusted net cash flow by interest expense paid on the 2008-1 Class A-1 Senior Term Notes, the Senior Working Capital Revolver, the Equipment Revolver and the unused commitment fees, respectively. The Company was in compliance with such measure at June 30, 2009. The Company is also required to maintain a cash interest reserve account in the name of the Indenture Trustee for Series 2008-1 Class A-1 Senior Term Notes, the Equipment Revolver interest, the Senior Working Capital Revolver and commitment fees under such agreements. The interest reserve is equal to six months estimated interest on the Series 2008-1 Class A-1 Notes, plus six months of the Class A-2 Senior Note Commitment Fee Amount, which is equal to 1.5% of the unused portion of the $30 million revolver, plus six months of the Class A-3 Senior Note Commitment Fee Amount, which is equal to 1.5% of the unused portion of the $20 million revolver, plus six months estimated interest on any outstanding balance in the Class A-2 and Class A-3 Senior Notes. 11. Shareholders' equity Common stocksuccessor company The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $.01 per share. At June 30, 2009 the number of shares of common stock outstanding was 119,837. At June 30, 2008 the number of shares of common stock outstanding was 99,772. Common shareholders are entitled to receive dividends as, and when, declared by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to rights of holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights as to dividends. There have been no dividends declared to date. The holder of each share of common stock is entitled to one vote with respect to matters voted upon by the common shareholders of the Company. Common stockpredecessor company The Predecessor Company was authorized to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $.001 per share. At June 30, 2007 the number of shares of common stock issued was 15,921,066, less treasury stock, at cost, of 921,409 shares. In connection with the Merger and Acquisition at May 28, 2008, there were 14,813,495 shares outstanding that were purchased by the Successor Company. Stock option plans On May 28, 2008, the Company adopted a Stock Incentive Plan (the "2008 Stock Incentive Plan") whereby options may be granted to employees, non-employee directors, and independent contractors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. Given the absence of an active market for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates the fair value of its common stock with the assistance of a related party valuation specialist contemporaneous with the dates of issuances for all options under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. In connection with the Merger and Acquisition, members of the Board of Directors of the Company and its executives were granted 12,020 options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, with an exercise price of $1,000 per share and a fair value of $353 per share. No granted options were vested or forfeited in the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008. During the year ended June 30, 2009, Company executives and certain management were granted an additional 5,502 options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, with a weighted average exercise price of $1,181 per share and a weighted average fair value of approximately $386 per share. The options vest ratably over a five year period from date of grant and have a contractual life of 10 years. There were 2,591 options vested during the year ended June 30, F-27 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 2009, having a total fair value of $0.9 million. The unrecognized compensation expense on nonvested awards is $5.4 million at June 30, 2009, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of 4.9 years. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of all outstanding options is 9.1 years as of June 30, 2009. The following table summarizes transactions pursuant to the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan: Options outstanding Weighted average grant- date fair value Weighted average exercise price Outstanding at May 28, 2008  $  $  Granted 12,020 353 1,000 Forfeited    Exercised    Outstanding at June 30, 2008 12,020  1,000 Granted 5,502 387 1,181 Forfeited (154 ) 352 1,000 Exercised    Outstanding at June 30, 2009 17,368  $ 1,057 Exercisable at June 30, 2009 2,591 $ 353 $ 1,000 Unvested at June 30, 2009 14,777 $ 365 $ 1,067 Additional information regarding options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2009 is as follows; Options outstanding Options outstanding Range Outstanding Weighted average contractual life (in years) Weighted average exercise price Exercisable Weighted average exercise price $1,000 - $1,425 17,368 9.12 $1,057 2,591 $1,000 The following table summarizes the activity of options outstanding that had not yet vested; Number of shares Weighted average grant- date fair value Unvested as of June 30, 2008 12,020 $353 Shares granted 5,502 $387 Vested during period (2,591 ) $353 Forfeited or cancelled (154 ) $352 Unvested as of June 30, 2009 14,777 $365 F-28 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 The table below summarizes key assumptions regarding the granting of stock options during the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, respectively. As permitted by ASC Topic 718, the fair value of each employee stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the significant assumptions noted in the table below. Stock options granted in connection with the Merger and Acquisition were valued using expected volatilities based on the historical volatility of the Predecessor Company's common stock using average daily closing prices as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market prior to the Merger and Acquisition, and other factors. Stock options granted subsequent to that event are based on the expected volatilities derived by analyzing the historical volatilities of comparable companies in the Company's industry sector. The Company uses the expected term of the options, estimated employee terminations, and expected business events within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees that have dissimilar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 505. In accordance with ASC Topic 505, stock options granted to non-employees are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock on the "valuation date," which for options to non-employees is the vesting date. Expenses related to the options granted to non-employees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury's yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Year ended June 30, 2009 May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 Assumptions Expected volatility 31.3 % 33.2 % Expected Dividends 0.0 % 0.0 % Expected term (in years) 5 5 Risk-free rate 2.7 % 3.4 % The Company recognized costs of approximately $1.1 million and $0.04 million, for the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to outstanding options. Prior to the Merger and Acquisition, the Predecessor Company had various share-based compensation plans designed for both non-employee directors and employees of the Predecessor Company, that were also periodically revised from time to time, up and until all such options were purchased on May 28, 2008 in connection with the Merger and Acquisition. The following explains such plans: (a) Non-employee director plans The Predecessor Company granted to each non-employee director options to purchase shares of common stock. The exercise price for all grants was equal to the average closing price of the common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the 20 trading days prior to the grant date. All options vested in two to five equal annual installments commencing upon issuance and have a 10-year term.

(b) Employee stock option plans In 1995, the Board of Directors adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan (the "1995 Plan"), which terminated in November 2005. Under the 1995 Plan, the Predecessor Company reserved 2,400,000 shares of common stock for employees of the Company. Under the terms of the 1995 Plan, options granted were either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of incentive stock options was required to be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of the grant, and the exercise price of non-qualified stock options was not to be less than 75% of the fair market value of the Predecessor Company's common stock at the date of the grant. The maximum term for all options was 10 years. Options granted prior to termination of the 1995 Plan generally vested in equal annual installments from three to five years, though a limited number of grants were partially vested at the grant date. In addition, in September 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the 2005 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2005 Employee Plan"). Under the 2005 Employee Plan, the Predecessor Company had reserved 250,000 shares of common stock for employees of the Company. The following table summarizes transactions pursuant to the 1995 Plan: Options outstanding Weighted average exercise price per option Options exercisable Outstanding at July 1, 2006 1,123,274 $15.49 877,661 Expired or canceled (29,019 ) 22.20 Exercised (252,274 ) 9.59 Outstanding at July 1, 2007 841,981 17.03 774,181 Forfeited (258 ) 22.49 Exercised or canceled (841,723 ) 17.03 Outstanding at May 28, 2008  All outstanding options outstanding at May 28, 2008 were purchased on such date in connection with the Merger and Acquisition. F-30 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 In October 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the 2005 Executive Management Stock Option Plan (the "2005 Executive Plan"). Under the 2005 Executive Plan, the Predecessor Company had reserved 1,500,000 shares of common stock for executives and key managers of the Predecessor Company, which were to be either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of stock options was required to be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the Predecessor Company's common stock at the date of the grant. The maximum term for all options was ten years. In addition, executive officers granted options under the initial grant in 2005 were not be eligible to receive additional options until fiscal 2008. Options granted were expected to vest over a period of one to three years based on the achievement of annual performance targets established by the Board of Directors. However, all options granted were to vest over a period of not less than two fiscal years up to a maximum of five fiscal years, and any unvested options vest at the end of the five years. The following summarizes the transactions pursuant to the 2005 Executive Plan: Options outstanding Weighted average exercise price per option Options exercisable Outstanding at July 1, 2006 1,033,000 $24.51 258,249 Granted 55,000 24.47 Forfeited (186,750 ) 25.53 Exercised or canceled (12,750 ) 24.00 Outstanding at June 30, 2007 888,500 24.30 525,139 Forfeited (18,750 ) 29.08 Exercised or canceled (869,750 ) 24.20 Outstanding at May 28, 2008  All outstanding options at May 28, 2008 were purchased on such date in connection with the Merger and Acquisition. (c) Non-employee directors' stock option plans In 1995, the Board of Directors adopted the Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "1995 Directors' Plan"), which was terminated in May 2005. Under the 1995 Directors' Plan, each non-employee director received options for 6,000 shares of common stock on the date of his or her first election to the Board of Directors. In addition, on the third anniversary of each director's first election to the Board of Directors, and on each three year anniversary thereafter, each non-employee director received an additional option to purchase 6,000 shares of common stock. The exercise price per share for all options granted under the 1995 Directors' Plan was equal to the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of grant. All options vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. In May 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the 2005 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "2005 Directors' Plan") in which each director received options for 20,000 shares of common stock on the date of his or her first election to the Board of Directors. In addition, each non-employee director, on each anniversary date of his or her appointment, would receive an additional option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock under the 2005 Directors' Plan. The exercise price of all options granted under the 2005 Directors' Plan was required to be equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The Predecessor Company had reserved 200,000 shares of common stock under the 2005 Directors' Plan. F-31 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 The maximum term for all options under both plans (collectively, the "Directors' Plans") was 10 years. The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted under the 2005 Directors' Plan during the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 was $7.95. The following table summarizes transactions pursuant to the Directors' Plans: Options outstanding Weighted average exercise price per option Options exercisable Outstanding at July 1, 2006 93,000 $22.14 40,000 Granted 25,000 24.97 Outstanding at June 30, 2007 118,000 22.74 66,000 Granted 25,000 27.76 Exercised or canceled (143,000 ) 23.62 Outstanding at May 28, 2008  All outstanding options outstanding at May 28, 2008 were purchased on such date in connection with the Merger and Acquisition. The following table summarizes key assumptions regarding the granting of stock options used by the Predecessor Company in estimating fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the significant assumptions noted. Expected volatilities were based on historical volatility of the Predecessor Company's common stock using average daily closing prices as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and other factors. The Predecessor Company used both historical data and prospective trends to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have dissimilar historical exercise behavior were considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted were expected to be outstanding. The information given below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury's yield curve in effect at the time of grant. July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007 Assumptions Volatility 33.20 % 32.30 % Risk free interest rate 3.0 % 4.5 % Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % Expected term (in years) 3.5 years 4.2 years The Predecessor Company recognized $4.4 million ($2.7 million net of income taxes) in share-based compensation during the Predecessor Company period of July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008. As of July 1, 2007, there was $4.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the aforementioned plans, which was recognized in the period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008. Shares issued upon exercise of vested stock options prior to the Merger and Acquisition were issued from the Predecessor Company's authorized common stock pool. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 was $18.4 million. As of May 28, 2008, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the aforementioned plans. F-32 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 12. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows (in thousands): June 30 2009 2008 Deferred tax assets: Current: Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 153 $ 207 Executive incentives  629 153 836 Non-current: Intangible assets  2,209 Net operating loss carryforwards 37,913 35,318 Other 1,221 284 39,134 37,811 Valuation allowance (265 ) (217 ) Total deferred tax assets 39,022 38,430 Deferred tax liabilities: Non-current: Goodwill (6,296 ) (5,344 ) Fixed assets (35,667 ) (36,772 ) Intangible assets (58,408 )  Other (1,199 )  Total deferred tax liabilities (101,570 ) (42,116 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (62,548 ) $ (3,686 ) The Company's deferred tax assets include the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards incurred by the Predecessor Company through May 28, 2008 and the Successor Company through June 30, 2009. The Company's valuation allowance increased by approximately $.05 million during the year ended June 30, 2009 due to various state net operating loss carryforwards not expected to be utilized in future years. The Merger and Acquisition resulted in an increase in the deferred tax liability by $65.7 million due to the valuation of tangible and intangible assets at their fair market value as of the Merger and Acquisition date (see Note 3). As of the June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, the Company evaluated its ability to utilize its outstanding state and federal net operating loss carryforwards, subject to Section 382 IRS limitations. At June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence, it was concluded that the deferred tax asset relating to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not, except for the valuation allowance amount noted above, be F-33 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 realized in the future. In considering whether or not a valuation allowance was appropriate the Company considered several aspects, including, but not limited to the following items: > Cumulative pretax book income during the previous three fiscal years > Both positive and negative evidence as to the Company's ability to utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to expiration, such as the projected generation of taxable income, the Company's position in the market place, existence of long-term customer contracts, and growth opportunities > Future reversals of taxable temporary differences > Tax planning strategies The Company will continue to evaluate whether or not its net deferred tax assets will be fully realized prior to expiration. In order to utilize the entire deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate taxable income of approximately $99.2 million. Should it become more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance will be recorded. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $103.4 million and for state purposes in varying amounts. Under the Merger and Acquisition, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options of the Predecessor Company were exercised. That transaction resulted in an increase in the net operating loss carryforward of $6.9 million for federal income tax purposes, resulting from the excess tax benefit associated with the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and exercise of non-qualified stock options over the tax deduction from compensation expense recognized for those options. However, because the Company incurred a taxable loss for federal income tax purposes related to these exercises, the benefit is not recognized in the Company's net deferred tax liability. The benefit will be maintained "off balance sheet" until the deduction (NOL generated on the tax return) can be used to offset taxable income on a future tax return. Excluding such benefit, the net operating loss carryforwards, for book purposes, are $96.5 million as of June 30, 2009. During the year ended June 30, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service concluded an audit of the Predecessor Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007, subject to statutory limitations. As a result of this audit, the Company's net operating loss carryforwards were reduced by $6.4 million (or $2.5 million tax adjustment). The tax adjustment is reflected as an addition to goodwill associated with the Merger and Acquisition transaction. The federal net operating loss carryforwards expire through June 2025 as follows (in thousands): Year of Expiration 20102017 $  2018 4,506 2019 19,247 2020 20,004 2021 20,288 2022 10,236 2023 4,724 Thereafter 24,422 $ 103,427 F-34 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 The significant components for income taxes attributable to continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2009, the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 and the Predecessor Company year ended June 30, 2007, were as follows (in thousands): Successor Predecessor Year ended June 30, 2009 Period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 Period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 Year ended June 30, 2007 Current Federal $  $  $ (46 ) $ 141 State 282  265 139 TotalCurrent 282  219 280 Deferred Federal (5,751 ) (438 ) 4,327 5,547 State (1,122 ) (84 ) 834 1,066 TotalDeferred (6,873 ) (522 ) 5,161 6,613 Total $ (6,591 ) $ (522 ) $ 5,380 $ 6,893 The income tax provision differs from that which would result from applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% as follows (in thousands): Successor Predecessor Year ended June 30, 2009 Period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008 Period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 Year ended June 30, 2007 Tax at U.S. statutory rate $ (6,498 ) $ (504 ) $ 4,784 $ 5,086 State taxes, net of federal benefit (824 ) (63 ) 599 635 Non-deductible items 151  (720 ) 377 Expiring state net operating loss carry forwards 359  538 619 Other 221 45 179 176 $ (6,591 ) $ (522 ) $ 5,380 $ 6,893 During the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008, the Company recorded $2.1 million as additional paid-in capital representing the excess of the tax benefit associated with the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and exercise of non-qualified stock options over the tax deduction from compensation expense recognized for those options. No stock options were exercised for the year ended June 30, 2009 or the period ended May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008. The Company prepares its tax returns on a consolidated basis and uses the pro forma method to prepare such returns. The Company had no uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2009, or during the periods presented that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. F-35 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 13. Lease commitments The Company leases office equipment, trucks and warehouse/depot and office facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through October 2015. Primarily all of the facility leases contain renewal options and escalations for real estate taxes and common charges. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases (that have initial noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year) are as follows: Year ending June 30, (In thousands) 2010 $ 6,862 2011 5,124 2012 3,406 2013 2,098 2014 1,245 Thereafter 689 $ 19,424 Total rental expenses under non-cancelable operating leases were approximately $8.0 million, $0.6 million, $6.6 million, and $6.7 million, for the year ended June 30, 2009, the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008, and the Predecessor Company year ended June 30, 2007, respectively. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had leases on 388 vehicles classified as operating leases with a transportation company, under master lease agreements, with terms ranging generally from five to six years. 14. Concentration of credit and business risks The Company's business activity is with customers located within the United States. For all periods presented in these accompanying consolidated financial statements, virtually all the Company's sales were to customers in the food and beverage industry. There were no customers that accounted for greater than 5% of total sales for all periods presented in these accompanying consolidated financial statements, nor were there any customers that accounted for greater than 5% of total accounts receivable at June 30, 2009 and 2008. The Company purchases new bulk CO 2 systems from two major manufacturers of such systems. The inability of either or both of these manufacturers to deliver new systems to the Company could cause a delay in the Company's ability to fulfill the demand for its services and a possible loss of sales, which could adversely affect operating results. 15. Redeemable preferred stock The Company has authorized and issued two series of cumulative preferred stock, Series A and Series B. Both series have par a value of $0.01 per share and a stated value of $10,000 per share. The holder of each preferred share is entitled to receive dividends, annually on the last day of June, of 10% of the stated per share value. If the dividend is not paid, the amount due accumulates and includes an additional 10% of the unpaid amount due on the last day of June on the following year. There is no limitation on the amounts to be accrued in future years. F-36 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 For the Series A preferred stock, there were 11,000 shares authorized and 10,018 shares issued at June 30, 2009 with cumulative undeclared dividends of $11.1 million and 9,997 shares issued at June 30, 2008 with cumulative undeclared dividends of $0.9 million. For the Series B preferred stock, there were 2,500 shares authorized and 1,965 shares issued with cumulative undeclared dividends of $1.0 million at June 30, 2009. There were no shares issued at June 30, 2008. The cumulative undeclared dividends are deducted from the net (loss) income on the consolidated statements of operations to arrive at net (loss) income available to common shareholders. Liquidation preferences In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, the Series A and Series B holders are entitled to a liquidation preference, on a parity basis, of an amount per share outstanding equal to the sum of the stated value plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. In a liquidating event, after the Series A and Series B holders have received payment of their full liquidation preference, the remaining assets of the Company may be distributed to the holders of the common stock outstanding. Redemption features : a) Optional the Company may, subject to certain restrictions and at the option of the Board of Directors of the Company, redeem at any time, in whole or in part, the shares of the Series A and Series B preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the sum of the total stated value plus any and all accrued and unpaid dividends, as of the redemption date. b) Mandatory subject to a change of control in the Company, the Company shall redeem all, but not less than all, the shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the sum of the stated value plus any and all accrued and unpaid dividends, as of the redemption date. Voting rights The holders of the Series A and Series B preferred stock are not entitled to any voting rights with respect to any matters voted upon by the shareholders of the Company. The Series A and Series B cumulative preferred stock are accounted for under ASU 2009-04 and, accordingly, are classified outside the liabilities section of the balance sheet because the events that would result in redemption (including a change in control or liquidating event) are not deemed probable by the Company. 16. Commitments and contingencies In May 1997, the Company entered into an exclusive carbon dioxide supply agreement with Linde LLC, successor to The BOC Group, Inc. (Linde). Effective May 1, 2009, the Company and Linde amended such agreement to provide for the purchase by the Company of liquid carbon dioxide at 88 of the Company's 138 service locations. The terms of the amended agreement expire on May 1, 2014. Additionally, in May 2009, the Company also entered into multi-year agreements with three other carbon dioxide providers to fulfill its remaining annual supply requirements. Collectively, the agreements will ensure readily available high quality CO 2 . The agreements provide for annual price adjustments based on increases or decreases in the producer price index and other industry related indexes. F-37 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) June 30, 2009 The Company is a defendant in legal actions which arise in the normal course of business. The Company believes the outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 17. Related party transactions Robert L. Frome, a former Director of the Predecessor Company, is a member of the law firm of Olshan Grundman Frome Rosenzweig & Wolosky LLP, which was retained by the Predecessor Company. Fees paid by the Predecessor Company to such law firm during the Predecessor Company period from July 1, 2007 to May 28, 2008 and the Predecessor Company year ended June 30, 2007 were $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Pursuant to a Management Services Agreement dated as of May 28, 2008 (the "Management Services Agreement"), among the Company and Aurora Management Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("AMP"), AMP provides certain financial consulting services to the Company for an aggregate management fee of $1.0 million per annum, payable quarterly in advance on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. The Company recorded such fee in the amounts of $1.0 million and $.08 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, respectively, which is included in the statements of operations. The Management Services Agreement also provides that the Company will reimburse AMP for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by AMP in connection with the performance of their obligations under the Management Services Agreement. The Company recorded such costs in the amounts of $0.2 million and $0.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, respectively, which were capitalized as part of the Merger and Acquisition. The Company also incurred $0.2 million of such costs for the year ended June 30, 2009 that are included in the selling, general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations. In addition to the Management Services Agreement, AMP is entitled to receive a transaction fee for any acquisition or disposition consideration (including debt assumed by a purchaser and current assets retained by a seller) with respect to (i) any acquisition, (ii) any sale or disposition of any divisions (if applicable), (iii) any sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or (iv) any other sale of the Company's assets other than in the ordinary course of business. The Company recorded such fees in the amounts of $0.9 million and $9.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2009 and for the period from May 29, 2008 to June 30, 2008, respectively, which are related to the nexAir Acquisition and the Merger and Acquisition, respectively, and recorded such fees in the valuations of the acquired assets. The Management Services Agreement terminates on the earliest to occur of (i) the sale of all the outstanding capital stock of the Company, (ii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (iii) the merger of the Company or sale in one or a series of related transactions of the outstanding capital stock of the Company after which the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Company immediately prior to such merger or stock sale do not, immediately after such merger or stock sale, hold a majority of the voting power of the surviving corporation of the Company, as the case may be, or (iv) May 28, 2018. The Company is principally owned by Aurora. The existence of that control could result in the operating results or financial position of the Company being different from the results that would have been obtained if the Company was autonomous.

Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments The estimated fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities are summarized below (in thousands): 2009 2008 Estimated fair value Carrying amount Estimated fair value Carrying amount Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,371 $ 9,371 $ 4,111 $ 4,111 Restricted cash 17,787 17,787 19,442 19,442 Accounts receivable 9,454 9,454 9,438 9,438 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 20,008 20,008 19,569 19,569 Long-term debt 342,689 339,871 332,253 332,253 The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Long-term debt at June 30, 2009 was estimated based upon quoted market prices or by using discounted cash flow analyses based on estimated current rates for similar types of arrangements. Considerable judgment was required in developing certain of the estimate of fair value and, accordingly, the estimate presented herein is not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. Long-term debt at June 30, 2008 approximated its carrying amount due to the short duration between such reporting period and the Merger and Acquisition date (May 28, 2008) that gave rise to such debt. 19.

Subsequent events On February 1, 2010, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the beverage carbonation customers and related assets from Praxair Distribution, Inc. for $5.3 million in cash. The assets acquired are located in Denver and Michigan and are complementary to the Company's existing markets. On September 30, 2009, the Company acquired the beverage carbonation segment of Texas Welders Supply Company ("TWSCO") for $2.3 million cash. The assets acquired include customer accounts and related assets and the hiring of two operational employees. This transaction primarily covers the Houston, Texas area and is complementary to the Company's existing markets.

F-47 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) December 31, 2009 1. Description of business NuCO 2 Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Successor Company") believes it is the leading provider of bulk CO 2 equipment and distributor of bulk CO 2 to quick service restaurants and other customers in the United States based on bulk CO 2 equipment leased to customers. CO 2 is the necessary ingredient for beverage carbonation, which is a key component of fountain beverages. As of December 31, 2009, the Company operated a national network of 139 service locations (123 stationary and 16 mobile) servicing approximately 132,000 customer locations in 48 states. Currently, virtually all fountain beverage providers in the continental United States are within the Company's service area. The Company has entered into Master Service Agreements with many operators, including 133 restaurant and convenience store concepts that provide fountain beverages. These Master Service Agreements generally provide for a commitment by the operator to use the Company's services for all of its currently owned locations and may also include future locations. The Company currently services approximately 69,000 chain and franchisee locations that have signed Master Service Agreements. The Company is actively working on expanding the number of Master Service Agreements with numerous restaurant chains. The Company is principally owned by Aurora Equity Partners III, L.P. ("Aurora"), who holds approximately 73% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. Aurora is an affiliate of Aurora Capital Group, a Los Angeles based private equity firm. NuCO 2 Inc. changed its name from NuCO 2 Parent Inc. effective April 8, 2010 and all references throughout these accompanying consolidated financial statements have reflected such name change. NuCO 2 Florida Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of NuCO 2 Inc.) changed its name from NuCO 2 Inc. effective April 16, 2010 and all references throughout these accompanying consolidated financial statements have reflected such name change. 2. Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. However, the Company believes the disclosures contained herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The financial statements reflect all material adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows, which may result for the remainder of the year ending June 30, 2010. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2009. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. F-48 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance, codifying US GAAP as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental US GAAP, known as Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC" or the "Codification"). Under FASB ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, US GAAP does not change, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative US GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. All previously existing accounting standards documents were superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the FASB Codification is considered non-authoritative. These provisions of FASB ASC Topic 105 were effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and, accordingly, are in effect for the Company for the current fiscal reporting period. The adoption of the Codification did not have an impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations, but does impact its financial reports by eliminating all references to pre-codification standards and replacing them with Codification references. 3. Securitization transaction and merger and acquisition On May 28, 2008, NuCO 2 Florida Inc. (the "Predecessor Company") completed a merger (the Merger and Acquisition) with the Company, and NuCO 2 Merger Co., a Florida corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), under which Merger Sub merged with and into the Predecessor Company with the Predecessor Company surviving the Merger and Acquisition, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger and Acquisition, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Predecessor Company (other than treasury shares, shares owned by the Company, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) were converted automatically into the right to receive $30.00 in cash. The Successor Company, under its articles of incorporation, is authorized to issue 200,000 common shares, at $.01 par value. There were 119,850 and 119,837 common shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. Also, the Company is authorized to issue a total of 15,000 shares of preferred stock at $.01 par value, of which 11,983 shares were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, and divided into two tranches Series A and Series B (see Note 14). In connection with the Merger and Acquisition, the Company engaged in a whole business securitization (the Securitization Transaction), the purpose of which was to secure debt financing with the assets of the Company. As part of the Securitization Transaction, the Company and certain of the Company's subsidiaries, issued debt (the "Securitization Offering") in the aggregate amount of $355.0 million, which consisted of $280.0 million of Fixed Rate Series 2008-1 Senior Notes and $75.0 million of Fixed Rate Series 2008-1 Subordinated Notes (the "Series 2008-1 Notes") (see Note 9). In connection with the Securitization Transaction, the Successor Company formed the following five limited purpose Delaware limited liability companies: > NuCO 2 Funding LLC ("Master Issuer") > NuCO 2 LLC ("Contract Holder") > NuCO 2 Supply LLC ("Equipment Holder") > NuCO 2 IP LLC ("IP Holder") > NuCO 2 Management LLC ("Employee Company") F-49 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 The Master Issuer and the Employee Company are each direct wholly owned subsidiaries of NuCO 2 Florida Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Master Issuer owns 100% of the preferred equity interests in the Employee Company. The Contract Holder, the Equipment Holder and the IP Holder are each direct wholly owned subsidiaries of the Master Issuer and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The table below summarizes the structure of the Company: The Merger and Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded on the Successor Company's balance sheet at their estimated fair value. As a result of the Merger and Acquisition and the consideration paid, $242.1 million of goodwill was recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Successor Company. The main drivers of the goodwill were the Company's historical revenue growth rate, as well as expectations for future revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and growth from organic and strategic initiatives including synergies arising from the transaction. These expectations of future business performance were key factors influencing the premium paid for the business. The goodwill associated with this Merger and Acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, during the year ended June 30, 2009, shareholders of the Company, including Aurora, contributed $39.1 million of additional capital to the Company related to the nexAir acquisition (see Note 4), which resulted in additional goodwill of $12.3 million being recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company. F-50 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 4. Acquisitions PepsiAmericas-Indianapolis On December 31, 2009, the Company acquired the beverage carbonation customers and related equipment of Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers of Indiana, Inc., dba PepsiAmericas-Indianapolis (Indy) region customer base for $0.08 million in cash. More specifically, the acquired assets included customer accounts and related assets. The transaction did not require hiring any of Indy's employees and is complementary to the Company's existing markets. The preliminary purchase price has been allocated solely to property and equipment and is subject to change pending a valuation analysis. Such analysis period is not expected to extend beyond December 31, 2010. Texas Welders Supply Company On September 30, 2009, the Company acquired the beverage carbonation segment of Texas Welders Supply Company ("TWSCO") for $2.3 million cash, subject to a purchase price adjustment of approximately $0.1 million withheld by the Company, pending a final reconciliation of customer and equipment counts. More specifically, the purchase included customer accounts and related assets and the hiring of two operational employees of TWSCO. The transaction did not require hiring any administrative employees. TWSCO's carbonation business primarily covers the Houston Texas area and is complementary to the Company's existing markets. The preliminary purchase price has been allocated solely to property and equipment and is subject to change pending a valuation analysis. Such analysis period is not expected to extend beyond September 30, 2010. PepsiAmericas-St. Louis On August 31, 2009, the Company acquired the beverage carbonation customers and related equipment of Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers, Inc., dba PepsiAmericas ("Pepsi") greater St. Louis region customer base for $0.1 million in cash. More specifically, the purchase included customer accounts and related assets. The transaction did not require hiring any of Pepsi's employees and is complementary to the Company's existing markets. The purchase price was allocated solely to property and equipment and has been accounted for as an asset acquisition. nexAir, LLC On December 31, 2008, the Company acquired the beverage carbonation segment of nexAir, LLC for approximately $43.3 million in cash, net of a purchase price adjustment of approximately $1.1 million previously held in escrow and subsequently returned to the Company, based on a final reconciliation of customer and equipment counts. More specifically, the purchase originally included customer accounts and related assets and required hiring certain operational employees of nexAir, LLC. The transaction did not require hiring any administrative employees. Based in Memphis, TN, nexAir, LLC's beverage carbonation business primarily spans 15 mid-south states and is complementary to the F-51 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 Company's existing markets. These factors, and others, contributed to the recognition of goodwill of approximately $12.3 million, all of which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Revenues and expenses of Indy, TWSCO, Pepsi and nexAir, LLC are included in the Company's results of operations from the date of acquisition. The acquisitions were not significant to the Company and, accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented. The nexAir Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the allocation of the purchase price for the nexAir Acquisition is as follows: Purchase Price Allocation (In thousands) Property and equipment $ 13,378 Customer lists 16,100 Non-compete agreement 1,600 Goodwill 12,261 Total assets acquired $ 43,339 In connection with the nexAir Acquisition, the Company borrowed $5.3 million under its equipment revolver. Additionally, shareholders of the Company contributed approximately $39.1 million to the Company to fund the nexAir Acquisition. 5. Summary of significant accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances with a financial institution in an amount that exceeds the federal government deposit insurance. Restricted cash The Company classifies restricted cash as all cash pledged as collateral to secure certain obligations and all cash whose use is limited. This includes cash held in escrow to fund interest payments on the Company's Series 2008-1 Notes and other trustee expenses related to the Merger and Acquisition. All of the Company's cash balances are insured through various U.S. government agencies. Revenue recognition Revenue from sales of bulk CO 2 and other gases is recognized when the product is shipped, a sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Rental fees on bulk CO 2 storage tanks and other equipment are recognized when earned. For contracts that contain multiple deliverables, principally product supply agreements for bulk CO 2 and equipment rental, revenue is recognized under guidance from FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ("ASC Topic 605") for certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities. The Company's bulk CO 2 budget plan agreements provide for a fixed monthly payment to cover the use of a F-52 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 bulk CO 2 system and a predetermined maximum quantity of CO 2 . As of December 31, 2009, approximately 68,800 of the Company's customer locations utilized this plan. Under the budget plan agreement, customers are billed an equal monthly amount which includes CO 2 up to an annual allowance. The contract arrangement for budget plan customers is analogous to a "take-or-pay" contract as defined under guidance from FASB ASC Topic 440, Commitments ("ASC Topic 440"), as the budget plan customer must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services. Each budget plan customer has a maximum CO 2 allowance that is measured and reset on the contract anniversary date. Because of the large number of customers under the budget plan agreement and the fact that the anniversary dates for determining maximum quantities are spread throughout the year, the Company's methodology for applying revenue recognition involves the use of estimates and assumptions to separate revenues derived from equipment rentals versus revenues from CO 2 sales. The following table segregates revenue streams between revenues attributable to equipment rentals and revenues from sales of CO 2 and other gases for the following periods; Revenue stream Six months ended December 31, 2009 Six months ended December 31, 2008 CO2 and other gases $ 52,969 $ 50,311 Equipment rentals 30,770 25,763 Total revenues $ 83,739 $ 76,074 Deferred revenue The Company invoices selected customers generally on the fifteenth day of each month for services to be provided during the subsequent month. As a result, the Company records deferred revenue in its consolidated balance sheet upon receipt of cash on these invoices prior to the month to which they relate. The revenue related to these billings is recorded during the month in which the services are provided. Deferred revenue at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, amounted to $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts The Company recognizes trade receivables when it invoices its customers on a monthly basis, with payment generally due within 30 days of the invoice date. The Company does not provide discounts for early payment. The Company has established a reserve for trade receivables that might not be collectible. Such reserve is evaluated and adjusted on a monthly basis by examining the Company's historical losses, aging of its trade receivables, the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing evaluations, and current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. The composition of receivables consists of on-time payers, "slow" payers, and at risk receivables, such as receivables from customers who no longer do business with the Company, are bankrupt, or are out of business. The Company maintains a policy for charging off uncollectible trade receivables against the reserve after exhausting all collection efforts and determining that the account is uncollectible. F-53 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 Inventories Inventories, applied on a consistent basis, consist primarily of carbon dioxide gas and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lives of the related leases or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. The Company has a wide range of estimated useful lives of property and equipment because the useful lives of acquired equipment from various acquisitions are generally less than newly purchased assets acquired in the ordinary course of business. Repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are generally expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of all the Company's respective assets as follows: Estimated life Leased equipment 1-20 years Equipment and cylinders 1-20 years Vehicles 1-5 years Computer equipment and software 1-5 years Office furniture and fixtures 1-7 years Leasehold improvements lease term The Company does not depreciate bulk systems held for installation until the systems are ready for their intended use and leased to customers. Upon installation, the systems, component parts and direct costs associated with the installation are transferred to the leased equipment account. These direct costs are associated with successful placements of such systems with customers under noncancelable contracts, which would not be incurred by the Company but for a successful placement, and they are amortized over the life of the original customer contract. Upon early service termination, the unamortized portion of direct costs associated with the installation are recognized as a period expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Such policy is analogous to FASB ASC Topic 310, Receivables , related to the accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases. Refurbishment costs The Company's tanks require vacuum refurbishment, every seven to ten years, to maintain effective operation of the tanks for the expected useful life of the tanks of 20 years. Such refurbishment is considered to be an overhaul to extend the useful life of the assets as compared to a minor maintenance activity. The Predecessor Company previously expensed such costs as a period expense. In connection with the Merger and Acquisition, the Successor Company began capitalizing costs directly related to the refurbishment of existing tanks and is amortizing these costs over the estimated remaining life of the refurbishment, or seven years. The Company has recorded approximately $6.6 million and $4.4 million of capitalized refurbishment costs, which are included in property and equipment in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, as of December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. Accumulated depreciation of these costs was $0.7 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. F-54 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 Costs of computer software obtained for internal use The Company is currently in the process of implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software package to coordinate all the resources, information, and activities needed to complete business processes. The Company accounts for such costs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC Topic 350") as it relates to accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use. Under such guidance, certain costs incurred during the application development stage should be capitalized. The Company has capitalized approximately $2.6 million and $1.5 million of costs associated with the new ERP implementation, which are included in property and equipment in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, as of December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. The Company expensed such costs of $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company anticipates an increase in capitalized ERP costs over the next two quarters of fiscal year 2010 as the software implementation is completed. Segment reporting Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or decision making group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has determined that it has one reportable business segment, the distribution of services related to the storage, blending and dispensing of bulk CO 2 equipment and bulk CO 2 gases to a single customer base. The Company's chief operating decision maker reviews financial information of the Company as a whole for purposes of assessing financial performance and making operating decisions. Accordingly, the Company considers itself to be operating in a single industry segment. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the Company for all transactions accounted for as business combinations. The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill at least annually (at December 31) to assess impairment since this asset is not amortized. Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill or any intangible asset whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company assesses impairment by comparing the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value. Specifically, the Company tests for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350. ASC Topic 350 also requires that goodwill be assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment. The Company has previously determined that in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting , that it has only one reportable segment and one reporting unit. For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired. The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over the asset's implied fair value. Impairments are expensed when incurred. The Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment to date. F-55 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 Also, under ASC Topic 350, the Company reviews, on an annual basis, the carrying value of its other indefinite-lived intangible asset, trade names, for impairment indicators. If impairment indicators are present, then the Company may perform additional analysis, such as discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals, to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value estimate. Impairment is then measured and the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value is expensed. The Company has not recognized any impairment for its trade names to date. Other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized on a straight-line method over the periods of expected benefit. The Company's other finite-lived intangible assets consist of customer lists, proprietary technology, and non-competition agreements. Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and trade names, consist of property and equipment, customer lists, proprietary technology, and non-competition agreements. Under FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment , long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment losses are recognized only if the carrying amounts of long-lived assets are deemed to be not recoverable and exceed the asset's fair values. The impairment loss would be calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value of the asset with fair value generally estimated based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows relating thereto. There was no indication of impairment for any periods presented. Deferred financing cost, net The Company's financing costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the related indebtedness. Such amortized costs are included in interest expense in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred total deferred financing costs of approximately $20.4 million in connection with the Securitization Transaction. Deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009 were $14.9 million and $16.7 million, respectively. Deferred lease acquisition costs, net Deferred lease acquisition costs consist of commissions associated with the acquisition of new leases and lease renewals and are being amortized on a straight-line method over the life of the related leases. Deferred lease acquisition costs, net of accumulated amortization at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009 were $2.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Income taxes and other Income taxes are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC Topic 740"), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities as they relate to the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's financial statements and/or income tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Under ASC Topic 740, the effect F-56 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. ASC Topic 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. It also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties. Under ASC Topic 740, the Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expense. The Company collects sales tax and property tax amounts due to governmental authorities from its customers. These payments are remitted to the appropriate taxing authority and recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations on a net basis. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates used when accounting for items such as allowances for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization periods, valuation of goodwill, long-lived assets and income taxes are regarded by management as being particularly significant. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and may require adjustment in the near term and, as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Share-based compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ("ASC Topic 718"). After assessing alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions, the Company is using the Black-Scholes valuation model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grants. The Company estimates a zero percent forfeitures rate in its expense calculations as grants have limited to select management personnel only and forfeiture history has been minor. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Company presents the excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees (ASC Topic 505). Employee benefit plan On June 1, 1996, the Predecessor Company adopted a deferred compensation plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers all eligible employees, and was transferred to the Company. Under the provisions of the plan, eligible employees may defer a percentage of their compensation subject to the Internal Revenue Service limits. Contributions to the plan are made by employees and matched at the Company's discretion, up to a maximum of 2% of employee's wages. The Company contributed $0.2 million and $0.2 million to the plan, for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and recorded these contributions in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. F-57 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 6. Recent accounting pronouncements In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13 ("ASU 2009-13"), Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force . ASU 2009-13 applies to all entities who are vendors that enter into multiple-deliverable arrangements with their customers. ASU 2009-13 provides amendments to the criteria in ASC Topic 605 for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements, establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, and eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires the relative selling price method in allocating discounts. This update also expands disclosures related to a vendor's multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU-2009-13 will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2009-13 will have on its condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-05 ("ASU 2009-05"), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value . ASU 2009-05 applies to all entities that measure liabilities at fair value within the scope of ASC Topic 820. ASU 2009-05 provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques: 1.) A valuation technique that uses: a. The quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset. b. Quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets. 2.) Another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of ASC Topic 820. Two examples would be an income approach, such as a technique that is based on the amount at the measurement date that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability. The amendments in ASU 2009-5 also clarify that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. It also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair value measurements. The guidance provided in ASU 2009-5 became effective for the Company at July 1, 2009. However, because the Company does not currently have any liabilities that are recorded at fair value, the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-04 ("ASU 2009-04"), Accounting for Redeemable Equity InstrumentsAmendment to Section 480-10-S99 . ASU 2009-04 represents an update to Section 480-10-S99, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, per EITF Topic D-98, Classifiaction and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. This update is an SEC staff announcement that provides the SEC staff's views regarding the application of Accounting Series Release No. 268, Presentation in Financial Statements of "Redeemable Preferred Stocks" (ASR 268). ASR 268 requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified F-58 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 outside permanent equity if they are redeemable 1) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, 2) at the option of the holder, or 3) upon occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. The Company has determined that, because of certain redemption features included in its Series A and Series B preferred stock issuances (see Note 14) are not within the control of the Company, such securities should be classified as temporary equity on the balance sheet. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events (ASC Topic 855), which modifies current guidance in the auditing literature of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA"), Auditing Standards (AU) Section 560, and is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The guidance is largely similar to the current guidance in such auditing literature with some exceptions that are not intended to result in significant changes in practice. ASC Topic 855 applies to all entities that prepare financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. It defines subsequent events either as "recognized" or "non-recognized" subsequent events and refers to events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. ASC Topic 855 requires entities to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The Company previously adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 855 and evaluated the impact of material subsequent events through the date the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. No recognized or non-recognized subsequent events were identified requiring recognition in the condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements other than those disclosed in Note 19-Subsequent Event. On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements ("ASC Topic 820") in a market that is not active and illustrates key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for the financial asset is not active. The guidance had no impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued guidance now codified under ASC Topic 350, which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption was prohibited. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. In February 2008, the FASB issued guidance now codified under ASC Topic 820, which delayed the effective date of disclosure for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of ASC Topic 820 will have on its condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC Topic 805"). ASC Topic 805 requires, among other things, the expensing of direct transaction costs, including deal costs and restructuring costs as incurred, research and development assets acquired in a business combination to be capitalized, certain contingent assets and liabilities to be recognized at fair value, and earn-out arrangements, including contingent consideration, that may be required to be measured at fair value until settled, with changes in fair value recognized each period into earnings. ASC Topic 805 became effective for the Company on July 1, 2009 and F-59 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 could have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows if, and when, the Company completes significant asset and/or business acquisitions. 7.

Also included in leased equipment are refurbishment costs of $6.6 million and $4.4 million at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. As noted earlier, the Predecessor Company previously expensed refurbishment costs as a period expense. Accumulated depreciation and amortization of these costs was $12.3 million and $9.4 million at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. Upon early service termination, the Company writes off the remaining net book value of direct costs associated with the installation of equipment.

In order to finance a portion of the consideration payable to the shareholders of the Predecessor Company, the Company engaged in a whole business Securitization Transaction wherein the Master Issuer issued 2008-1 Class A-1 Senior Term Notes and 2008-1 Class B-1 Subordinated Notes (collectively the "Series 2008-1 Notes"). The Series 2008-1 Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer. The notes are structured with a five-year interest only period and are due in full upon maturity at June 25, 2013 unless extended by the Company. There are no required principal payments prior to that date as long as the Company is not in default of its covenants. The extension may be for two, one-year periods. If the extension is elected, the notes become floating-rate based, with the 2008-1 Class A-1 Senior Term Notes adjusting to a rate of LIBOR plus 7%, and the 2008-1 Class B-1 Subordinated Notes having a new rate of LIBOR plus 11%. On May 28, 2008, the Company also issued a class of senior floating rate asset backed variable funding notes with five-year terms to fund working capital (the "Senior Working Capital Revolver") in the amount of up to $20.0 million, with an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.5%. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no borrowings against the Senior Working Capital Revolver. The interest rate on the Senior Working Capital Revolver at December 31, 2009 was 4.7% per annum. On May 28, 2008, the Company also entered into a 5-year floating rate revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of future bulk CO 2 equipment (the "Equipment Revolver") in the amount of up to $30.0 million with an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.5%. At December 31, 2009, the Company had borrowings of approximately $6.5 million drawn against the Equipment Revolver. The Company is required to make monthly principal payments on the Equipment Revolver in an amount equal to, at a minimum, the difference, if any, between the amount outstanding and the applicable borrowing base amount of eligible equipment. The interest rate on the Equipment Revolver at December 31, 2009 was 4.7% per annum. F-62 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 The Senior Working Capital Revolver and the Equipment Revolver are subject to a 1.5% annual unused commitment fee, which is payable monthly, under the terms of the debt agreement. The Company recorded commitment fee expenses of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is included in interest expense in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Series 2008-1 Notes were issued at a discount of approximately $26.7 million, which is being amortized over the life of the notes using the effective interest method. The Company recorded amortization expense, using the effective interest method, of $2.4 million and $2.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is included in interest expense in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Under the terms of the May 28, 2008 Series 2008-1 Note Agreements, the Company is required to comply with certain weekly and monthly cash restrictions and criteria. Additionally, the Company must issue weekly and monthly manager reports to assess that certain compliance measures are maintained. One single financial covenant governs compliance for all the Company's debt, including the Company's revolving debt facilities, and requires that the Company maintain a three month Debt Service Coverage Ratio ("DSCR") of not lower than 1.20. The DSCR is calculated by dividing adjusted net cash flow by interest expense paid on the 2008-1 Class A-1 Senior Term Notes, the Senior Working Capital Revolver, the Equipment Revolver and the unused commitment fees, respectively. The Company was in compliance with all such measures under the Series 2008-1 Notes at December 31, 2009. The Company is also required to maintain a cash interest reserve account in the name of the Indenture Trustee for Series 2008-1 Senior Class A-1 Notes, the Equipment Revolver interest, the Senior Working Capital Revolver and commitment fees under such agreements. The interest reserve is equal to six months estimated interest on the Series 2008-1 Class A-1 Notes, plus six months of the Class A-2 Senior Note Commitment Fee Amount, which is equal to 1.5% of the unused portion of the $30 million revolver, plus six months of the Class A-3 Senior Note Commitment Fee Amount, which is equal to 1.5% of the unused portion of the $20 million revolver, plus six months estimated interest on any outstanding balance in the Class A-2 and Class A-3 Senior Notes. 10. Shareholders' equity Common stock The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $.01 per share. There were 119,850 and 119,837 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. Common shareholders are entitled to receive dividends as, and when, declared by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to rights of holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights as to dividends. There have been no dividends declared to date. The holder of each share of common stock is entitled to one vote with respect to matters voted upon by the common shareholders of the Company. Stock option plans On May 28, 2008, the Company adopted a Stock Incentive Plan (the "2008 Stock Incentive Plan") whereby options may be granted to employees, non-employee directors, and independent contractors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. Given the absence of an active market for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates the fair value of its common stock with assistance of a related party valuation specialist contemporaneous with the dates of issuance for all options under F-63 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan). In connection with the Merger and Acquisition, members of the Board of Directors of the Company and its executives were granted 12,020 options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, with an exercise price of $1,000 per share and a fair value of $353 per share. During the six months ended December 31, 2009 and the year ended June 30, 2009, newly hired Company executives and managers were granted 721 and 5,502 options, respectively, to purchase shares of common stock of the Company. The options vest ratably over a five year period from date of grant and have a contractual life of 10 years. There were 2,975 shares vested at December 31, 2009 having a total fair value of $1.0 million. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of all outstanding options is 8.7 years as of December 31, 2009. The following table summarizes transactions pursuant to the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan: Options outstanding Average grant-date fair value Weighted average exercise price Outstanding at June 30, 2009 17,368 $ 1,057 Granted 721 $ 502 $ 1,425 Forfeited (123 ) $ 353 $ 1,000 Exercised (44 ) $ 352 $ 1,000 Outstanding at December 31, 2009 17,922 $ 1,073 Exercisable at December 31, 2009 2,975 $ 344 $ 1,000 Unvested at December 31, 2009 14,947 $ 374 $ 1,087 Additional information regarding options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2009 is as follows; Options outstanding Options outstanding Range Outstanding Weighted average contractual life (in years) Weighted average exercise price Exercisable Weighted average exercise price $1,000 - $1,425 17,922 8.66 $ 1,073 2,975 $ 1,000 The following table summarizes the activity of options outstanding that had not yet vested; Number of shares Weighted average grant-date fair value Unvested as of June 30, 2009 14,777 $ 365 Shares granted 721 $ 502 Vested during period (384 ) $ 283 Forfeited or cancelled (123 ) $ 353 Exercised (44 ) $ 352 Unvested as of December 31, 2009 14,947 $ 374 F-64 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 The table below summarizes key assumptions regarding the granting of stock options during the six months ended December 31, 2009. As permitted by ASC Topic 718, the fair value of each employee stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the significant assumptions noted in the table below. Stock options granted in connection with the Merger and Acquisition were valued using expected volatilities based on the historical volatility of the Predecessor Company's common stock using average daily closing prices as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market prior to the Merger and Acquisition, and other factors. Stock options granted subsequent to that event are based on the expected volatilities derived by analyzing the historical volatilities of comparable companies in the Company's industry sector. The Company uses the expected term of the options, estimated employee terminations, and expected business events within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees that have dissimilar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 505. In accordance with ASC Topic 505, stock options granted to non-employees are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the basis of the market price of the underlying common stock on the "valuation date," which for options to non-employees is the vesting date. Expenses related to the options granted to non-employees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury's yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Six months ended December 31, 2009 Assumptions Expected volatility 35.7 % Expected Dividends 0.0 % Expected term (in years) 5 Risk-free rate 2.4 % The Company recognized costs of approximately $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to outstanding options.

Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company's income tax expense is based on its estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. Differences in the effective tax rate from the statutory rate are generally due to state income taxes and non-deductible expenses. The effective tax rate for the Company for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 37.5% and 38.6%, respectively. The Company's deferred tax assets amounted to approximately $39.4 million at December 31, 2009 and include the benefit of federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $103.4 million incurred by the Predecessor Company through May 28, 2008 and the Company through June 30, 2009. The Merger and Acquisition resulted in an increase in the deferred tax liability by $65.7 million to approximately $101.6 million at June 30, 2009 due to the valuation of tangible and intangible assets at their fair market value as of the Merger and Acquisition date (see Note 3). Total deferred tax liability, net of non-current deferred tax assets, is $61.3 million and $62.7 million at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. As of June 30, 2009, the Company evaluated its ability to utilize its outstanding state and federal net operating loss carryforwards, subject to Section 382 IRS limitations. After consideration of all available positive and negative evidence, it was concluded that the $37.9 million deferred tax asset relating to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not, except for a valuation allowance of $0.3 million, be realized in the future. In considering whether or not a valuation allowance was appropriate the Company considered several aspects, including, but not limited to the following items: > Cumulative pretax book income during the previous three fiscal years > Both positive and negative evidence as to the Company's ability to utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to expiration, such as the projected generation of taxable income, the Company's position in the market place, existence of long-term customer contracts, and growth opportunities > Future reversals of taxable temporary differences > Tax planning strategies The Company will continue to evaluate whether or not its net deferred tax assets will be fully realized prior to expiration. In order to utilize the entire deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $99.2 million. Should it become more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance will be recorded. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $103.4 million and for state purposes in varying amounts. Under the Merger and Acquisition, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options of the Predecessor Company were exercised. That transaction resulted in an increase in the net operating loss carryforward of $6.9 million for federal income tax purposes, resulting from the excess tax benefit F-66 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 associated with the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and exercise of non-qualified stock options over the tax deduction from compensation expense recognized for those options. However, because the Company incurred a taxable loss for federal income tax purposes related to these exercises, the benefit is not recognized in the Company's net deferred tax liability. The benefit will be maintained "off balance sheet" until the deduction (NOL generated on the tax return) can be used to offset taxable income on a future tax return. Excluding such benefit, the net operating loss carryforwards, for book purposes, are $96.5 million as of June 30, 2009. During the year ended June 30, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service concluded an audit of the Predecessor Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007, subject to statutory limitations. As a result of this audit, the Company's net operating loss carryforwards were reduced by $6.4 million (or $2.5 million tax adjustment). The tax adjustment is reflected as an addition to goodwill associated with the Merger and Acquisition transaction. The federal net operating loss carryforwards, as of June 30, 2009, expire through June 2025 as follows (in thousands): Year of expiration 2010-2017 $  2018 4,506 2019 19,247 2020 20,004 2021 20,288 2022 10,236 2023 4,724 Thereafter 24,422 $ 103,427 The Company records as additional paid-in capital the excess of the tax benefit associated with the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and exercise of non-qualified stock options over the tax deduction from compensation expense recognized for those options. The Company had no uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009, or during the periods presented that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate. 12. Lease commitments The Company leases office equipment, trucks and warehouse/depot and office facilities under various operating leases. Primarily all of the facility leases contain renewal options and escalations for real estate taxes and common charges. Total rental expenses under non-cancelable operating leases were approximately $4.3 million and $3.8 million, for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had leases on 360 vehicles classified as operating leases with a transportation company, under master lease agreements, with terms ranging generally from five to six years. F-67 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 13. Concentration of credit and business risks The Company's business activity is with customers located within the United States. For the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, virtually all the Company's sales were to customers in the food and beverage industry. The Company purchases new bulk CO 2 systems from two major manufacturers of such systems. The inability of either or both of these manufacturers to deliver new systems to the Company could cause a delay in the Company's ability to fulfill the demand for its services and a possible loss of sales, which could adversely affect operating results. 14. Redeemable preferred stock The Company has authorized and issued two series of cumulative preferred stock, Series A and Series B. Both series have par a value of $0.01 per share and a stated value of $10,000 per share. The holder of each preferred share is entitled to receive dividends, annually on the last day of June, of 10% of the stated per share value. If the dividend is not paid, the amount due accumulates and includes an additional 10% of the unpaid amount due on the last day of June on the following year. There is no limitation on the amounts to be accrued in future years. For the Series A preferred stock, there were 11,000 shares authorized and 10,018 shares issued at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively, with cumulative undeclared dividends of $16.9 million and $11.1 million at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. For the Series B preferred stock, there were 2,500 shares authorized and 1,965 shares issued at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively, with cumulative undeclared dividends of $2.0 million and $1.0 million at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively. The cumulative undeclared dividends are deducted from the net loss on the condensed consolidated statements of operations to arrive at net loss available to common shareholders. Liquidation preferences In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, the Series A and Series B holders are entitled to a liquidation preference, on a parity basis, of an amount per share outstanding equal to the sum of the stated value plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. In a liquidating event, after the Series A and Series B holders have received payment of their full liquidation preference, the remaining assets of the Company may be distributed to the holders of the common stock outstanding. Redemption features: a) Optional the Company may, subject to certain restrictions and at the option of the Board of Directors of the Company, redeem at any time, in whole or in part, the shares of the Series A and Series B preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the sum of the total stated value plus any and all accrued and unpaid dividends, as of the redemption date. b) Mandatory subject to a change of control in the Company, the Company shall redeem all, but not less than all, the shares of Series A and Series B preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the sum of the stated value plus any and all accrued and unpaid dividends, as of the redemption date. Voting rights The holders of the Series A and Series B preferred stock are not entitled to any voting rights with respect to any matters voted upon by the shareholders of the Company. F-68 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 The Series A and Series B cumulative preferred stock are accounted for under ASU 2009-04 and, accordingly, are classified outside the liabilities section of the balance sheet because the events that would result in redemption (including a change in control or liquidating event) are not deemed probable by the Company. 15. Commitments and contingencies In May 1997, the Company entered into an exclusive carbon dioxide supply agreement with Linde LLC, successor to The BOC Group, Inc. (Linde). Effective May 1, 2009, the Company and Linde amended such agreement to provide for the purchase by the Company of liquid carbon dioxide at 88 of the Company's 139 service locations. The terms of the amended agreement expire on May 1, 2014. Additionally, in May 2009, the Company also entered into multi-year agreements with three other carbon dioxide providers to fulfill its remaining annual supply requirements. Collectively, the agreements will ensure readily available high quality CO 2 . The agreements provide for annual price adjustments based on increases or decreases in the producer price index and other industry related indexes. The Company is a defendant in legal actions which arise in the normal course of business. The Company believes the outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 16. Related party transactions Pursuant to a Management Services Agreement dated as of May 28, 2008 (the Management Services Agreement), among the Company and Aurora Management Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (AMP), AMP provides certain financial consulting services to the Company for an aggregate management fee of $1.0 million per annum, payable quarterly in advance on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. The Company recorded such fee in the amounts of $0.5 million and $0.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Management Services Agreement also provides that the Company will reimburse AMP for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by AMP in connection with the performance of their obligations under the Management Services Agreement. The Company recorded such costs in the amounts of $0.05 million and $0.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is included in the selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations. In addition to the Management Services Agreement, AMP is entitled to receive a transaction fee for any acquisition or disposition consideration (including debt assumed by a purchaser and current assets retained by a seller) with respect to (i) any acquisition, (ii) any sale or disposition of any divisions (if applicable), (iii) any sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or (iv) any other sale of the Company's assets other than in the ordinary course of business. The Company recorded such fees in the amounts of $0.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008, which are related to the nexAir Acquisition, and recorded such fees in the valuations of the acquired assets. The Management Services Agreement terminates on the earliest to occur of (i) the sale of all the outstanding capital stock of the Company, (ii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (iii) the merger of the Company or sale in one or a series of related transactions of the F-69 Table of Contents NuCO 2 Inc. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) December 31, 2009 outstanding capital stock of the Company after which the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Company immediately prior to such merger or stock sale do not, immediately after such merger or stock sale, hold a majority of the voting power of the surviving corporation of the Company, as the case may be, or (iv) May 28, 2018. The Company is principally owned by Aurora. The existence of that control could result in the operating results or financial position of the Company being different from the results that would have been obtained if the Company was autonomous. 17. Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments The estimated fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities are summarized below (in thousands): December 31, 2009 June 30, 2009 Estimated fair value Carrying amount Estimated fair value Carrying amount Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,924 $ 7,924 $ 9,371 $ 9,371 Restricted cash 18,014 18,014 17,787 17,787 Accounts receivable 10,733 10,733 9,454 9,454 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 17,734 17,734 20,008 20,008 Long-term debt 344,439 341,962 342,689 339,871 The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The estimated fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively, was estimated based upon quoted market prices or by using discounted cash flow analyses based on estimated current rates for similar types of arrangements. Considerable judgment was required in developing certain of the estimate of fair value and, accordingly, the estimate presented herein is not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.

ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (a) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective; and (b) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. II-6 Table of Contents SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the Registrant has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Stuart, Florida, on April 16, 2010.
