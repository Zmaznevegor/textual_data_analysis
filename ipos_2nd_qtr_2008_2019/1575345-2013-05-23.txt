We are offering to sell common stock and seeking offers to common stock only in jurisdictions where offers and sales are permitted. BUSINESS SUMMARY We are a development-stage company, incorporated in the State of Florida on April 8, 2013, as a for-profit company with a fiscal year end of April 30. Our business and registered office is located at 3811 Alden Way., Sarasota, FL. 34232. Our telephone number is 941-650-3848, E-mail tranquilmoments@gmail.com. We have not generated any revenues to date and our activities have been limited to developing our business plan and develop a web site. We will not have the necessary capital to develop or execute our business plan until we are able to secure financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on suitable terms. Even if we raise 100% of the offering, we will not have sufficient capital to begin generating revenues from operations. We do not anticipate generating revenues until at least 18 months after we complete a $575,000 capital raise (which is in addition to the $37,500 capital raise from this offering). We need to raise $575,000 (in addition to the $37,500 capital raise from this offering) to execute our business plan over the next 18 months. The funds raised in this offering, even assuming we sell all the shares being offered, will be insufficient to commercialize our intended service or develop our business strategy. We anticipate a burn rate of approximately $1,000 per month. At 35% of shares sold, our burn rate would be 14 months; at 50%, it would be 11 months; at 50%, 19 months; at 75% it would be 28 months and at 100%, 38 months. We will receive all proceeds from the sale of the common stock and intend to use the proceeds from this offering to begin implementing the business and marketing plan. The expenses of this offering, including the preparation of this prospectus and the filing of this registration statement, estimated at $9,000 are being paid for by us. The maximum proceeds from this offering ($37,500) will satisfy our basic subsistence level, cash requirements for up to 12 months including legal and accounting costs associated with this offering, the costs associated with our continuous disclosure obligations, incidental expenses, and the cost of implementing the investigative aspects of our business plan, including identifying and securing additional sources of financing, consultants, operating equipment, marketing and facility. 75% of the possible proceeds from this offering ($28,125) will satisfy our basic, subsistence level cash requirements for up to 29 months, while 50% of the proceeds ($18,500) will sustain us for up to 19 months, and 35% of the proceeds ($13,125) will sustain for up to 14 months. Our budgetary allocations may vary, however, depending upon the percentage of proceeds that we obtain from the offering. For example, we may determine that is it more beneficial to allocate funds toward securing potential financing and business opportunities in the short terms rather than to conserve funds to satisfy continuous disclosure requirements for a longer period. Nevertheless, if we are only successful in selling 35% or less of the shares being registered, we will dedicate all proceeds to satisfying our continuous disclosure requirements. We do not have adequate funds to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next eighteen months. We will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations. During the 12 months following the completion of this offering, we intend to implement our business and marketing plan. We believe we must raise a total of $575,000 to pay for expenses associated with our development over the next 18 months. In their audit report dated May 13, 2013, our auditors have expressed an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an on going business. Because our sole director and officer may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance any additional capital to us, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital within 12 months of the effective date of this registration statement, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plan. Due to the fact that there is no minimum investment and no refunds on sold shares, you may be investing in a company that will not have the funds necessary to develop its business strategies. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment. Envoy Group Corp. intends to open Adult Day Care Centers in target areas across the United States. The Adult Day Care Centers will provide seniors with a social community enabling them to enjoy their day while receiving the care and support they need. With life expectancy rising, more and more seniors will require assistance as they age. Envoy Group Corp. intends to be designed for seniors who can no longer manage independently, or who are isolated and lonely. There were 40.1 million Americans aged 65 or older in 2010 and 80.1 million projected in 2050. (http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p23-190/p23190-f.pdf). Envoy Group Corp. believes that as the population grays and lives longer, the demand and need for the care of the elderly will grow and rise in importance. Meeting their special needs is expected to be one of the fastest growing industries. - 4 - We have not generated any revenues to date and our activities have been limited to developing our business plan. We will not have the necessary capital to develop our business plan until we are able to secure the $37,500 financing from this offering assuming all the shares offered are sold. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available from this offering. Assuming we sell all the shares offered in this offering, the $37,500 raised will be insufficient to commercialize our business or develop our business strategy. Consequently, we need to raise an additional $575,000 to implement our business plan over the next 18 months. SUMMARY OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following table sets forth selected financial information, which should be read in conjunction with the information set forth in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations” section and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Prospectus. Period From Inception on April 8, 2013 to April 30, 2013 (Audited) Revenues $ — Expenses 92 Net Loss (92 ) Net Loss per share $ (0.00 ) As at April 30, 2013 (Audited) Working Capital (Deficiency) $ 8,908 Total Assets $ 8,908 Total Current Liabilities $ — As indicated in the financial statements accompanying this prospectus, we have had no revenue to date and have incurred only losses since inception. We have had limited operations and have been issued a “going concern” opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations. The Company is electing to not opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period. This may make its financial statements more difficult to compare to other companies. Pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used . Emerging Growth Company The recently enacted JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on emerging growth companies. The Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company and so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company,” it will, among other things: be temporarily exempted from the internal control audit requirements Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act be temporarily exempted from various existing and forthcoming executive compensation-related disclosures, for example: “say-on-pay”, “pay-for-performance”, and “CEO pay ratio”. be temporarily exempted from any rules that might be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or supplemental auditor discussion and analysis reporting; - 5 - be temporarily exempted from having to solicit advisory say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden-parachute shareholder votes on executive compensation under Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; be permitted to comply with the SEC’s detailed executive compensation disclosure requirements on the same basis as a smaller reporting company; and, be permitted to adopt any new or revised accounting standards using the same timeframe as private companies (if the standard applies to private companies). Our company will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest of: the last day of the fiscal year during which we have annual total gross revenues of $1 billion or more; the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities in an offering registered under the Securities Act; the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during a previous three-year period; or the date on which we become a large accelerated filer, which generally is a company with a public float of at least $700 million (Exchange Act Rule 12b-2). RISK FACTORS Please consider the following risk factors and other information in this prospectus relating to our business and prospects before deciding to invest in our common stock. This offering and any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. We consider the following to be the material risks for an investor regarding this offering. Our company should be viewed as a high-risk investment and speculative in nature. An investment in our common stock may result in a complete loss of the invested amount. Please consider the following risk factors before deciding to invest in our common stock. Risks Related to our Business OUR OFFERING IS BEING CONDUCTED BY OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF AN UNDERWRITER WHO WOULD HAVE CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OF THE DISCLOSURE IN OUR PROSPECTUS. We have self-underwritten our offering on a “best efforts” basis, which means: No underwriter has engaged in any due diligence activities to confirm the accuracy of the disclosure in the prospectus or to provide input as to the offering price; our sole officer and director will attempt to sell the shares and there can be no assurance that all of the shares offered under the prospectus will be sold or that the proceeds raised from the offering, if any, will be sufficient to cover the costs of the offering; and there is no assurance that we can raise the intended offering amount. THE COMPANY’S ELECTION TO NOT OPT OUT OF THE JOBS ACT EXTENDED ACCOUNTING TRANSITION PERIOD MAY MAKE ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIFFICULT TO COMPARE TO OTHER COMPANIES. Pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used. - 6 - The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b)(2)(B) of the Act. Among other things, this means that the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, the Company may elect not to provide certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers that would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the Company. As a result, investor confidence in the Company and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY PROFITABLE AND MAY NOT BECOME PROFITABLE. At April 30, 2013, we had $8,301 cash on-hand and our stockholder’s equity was $6,301 and there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred operating losses since our formation and expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability. We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our business. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE PROCEEDS OF THIS OFFERING TO FUND OUR BUSINESS. IF WE DO NOT SELL ENOUGH SHARES IN THIS OFFERING TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS, THIS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON YOUR COMMON STOCK. As of April 30, 2013, ENVOY GROUP CORP. had $8,908 in assets and limited capital resources. In order to continue operating through 2013, we must raise approximately $37,500 in gross proceeds from this offering. We have approximately $9,000 in offering costs associated with this financing. The offering proceeds may not cover these costs, and, if this is the case, we will be in a worse financial condition after the offering. Unless we begin to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, we may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force us to cease operations if additional financing is not available. Also, as a public company, we will incur professional and other fees in connection with our quarterly and annual reports and other periodic filings with the SEC. Such costs can be substantial and we must generate enough revenue or raise money from offerings of securities or loans in order to meet these costs and our SEC filing requirements. We are offering our securities to the public; however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to sell the securities. And even if we sell the securities, there is no guarantee that the proceeds will be sufficient to fund our planned operations. OUR LACK OF AN OPERATING HISTORY GIVES NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS WILL RESULT IN PROFITABLE REVENUES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE SUSPENSION OR END OF OUR OPERATIONS We were incorporated on April 8, 2013 and we have not realized any revenues to date. We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon the completion of this offering and our ability to generate revenues through sales of our service/intended products. At April 30, 2013, we had $8,908 cash on-hand and our shareholder’s equity was $8,908; thus, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred operating losses since our formation and expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability. We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our business and may cause us to go out of business. BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT DEVELOPED AN ENVOY GROUP CORP. BUSINESS OUR ENVOY GROUP CORP. BUSINESS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE. - 7 - We have not developed an ENVOY GROUP CORP. (Adult Day Care Center) Business. At this time we have not begun developing our domain name (envoy-corp.com) website. We do not know the exact cost of its execution. In the case of a higher than expected cost of execution, we will not be able to offer our business. Furthermore, we may find problems in the process to develop an ENVOY GROUP CORP. (Adult Day Care Center) Business. If we are unable to execute the business, we will have to cease our operations, resulting in the complete loss of your investment. WE ARE A NEW COMPANY WITH NO OPERATING HISTORY AND WE FACE A HIGH RISK OF BUSINESS FAILURE WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT We are a development stage company formed recently to carry out the activities described in this prospectus and thus have only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of its prospectus can be made. We were incorporated on April 8, 2013 and to date have been involved primarily in the development of our business plan. We have limited business operations. Thus, there is no internal or industry-based historical financial data upon which to estimate our planned operating expenses. We expect that our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of market factors including, among others, the entry of new competitors offering a similar business; the availability of motivated and qualified personnel; the initiation, renewal or expiration of our ENVOY GROUP CORP. customer base specific economic conditions in the ENVOY GROUP CORP. Business and general economic conditions. Accordingly, our future sales and operating results are difficult to forecast. As of the date of this prospectus, we have earned no revenue. Failure to generate revenue will cause us to go out of business, which could result in the complete loss of your investment. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY RESTRICTING THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY MATERIALLY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. The recent downturn in the world’s major economies and the constraints in the credit markets have heightened or could continue to heighten a number of material risks to our business, cash flows and financial condition, as well as our future prospects. Continued issues involving liquidity and capital adequacy affecting lenders could affect our ability to access credit facilities or obtain debt financing and could affect the ability of lenders to meet their funding requirements when we need to borrow. Further, in the uncertain event that a public market for our stock develops, the volatility in the equity markets may make it difficult in the future for us to access the equity markets for additional capital at attractive prices, if at all. The current credit crisis in other countries, for example, and concerns over debt levels of certain other European Union member states, has increased volatility in global credit and equity markets. If we are unable to obtain credit or access capital markets, our business could be negatively impacted. For example, we may be unable to raise all or a portion the $575,000 that we estimate we will require to launch our business (in addition to the $37,500 capital raised from this offering). BECAUSE OUR CURRENT OFFICER AND DIRECTOR DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN STARTING AN ENVOY GROUP CORP. (Adult Day Care Center) COMPANY WE ARE A HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT. Our Chief Executive Officer and Director does not have experience in developing an ENVOY GROUP CORP. (Adult Day Care Center) Business. Additionally, we currently have no customers of our intended business. Therefore, without this experience, our management’s business experience may not be enough to effectively start-up and maintain our company. As a result, the implementation of our business plan may be delayed, or eventually, unsuccessful. BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, WE MUST LIMIT OUR MARKETING ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT, OUR SALES MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities to potential customers having the likelihood of purchasing our business. We intend to generate revenue through the sale of our business. Because we will be limiting the scope of our marketing activities, we may not be able to generate enough sales to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. - 8 - OUR BUSINESS MAY NOT FIND ACCEPTANCE WITH THE ADULT DAY CARE COMMUNITY. We are a new company with no established visibility or recognition in the Adult Daycare community. If we are not able to have our ENVOY GROUP CORP. (Adult Day Care Center) business accepted by the marketplace, we may not be able to generate revenues and our business plan may fail. OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY PROVE UNPREDICTABLE WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT. Our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which we have no control. Factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly include: our inability to generate enough working capital from future equity sales; the level of commercial acceptance by consumers of our services; fluctuations in the demand for our service the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure and general economic conditions. If realized, any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR MAY NOT BE IN A POSITION TO DEVOTE A MAJORITY OF HER TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS AND EVEN BUSINESS FAILURE. Ms. Jocelyn Nicholas, our sole officer and director, has other outside business activities and is devoting approximately 10-25 hours per week to our operations. Our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are not convenient to Ms. Nicholas, which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of our business plan. Such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of the business. KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL MAY LEAVE THE COMPANY WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. Because we are entirely dependent on the efforts of its sole officer and director, her departure or the loss of other key personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on the business. We believe that all commercially reasonable efforts have been made to minimize the risks attendant with the departure by key personnel from service. However, there is no guarantee that replacement personnel, if any, will help the Company to operate profitably. We do not maintain key person life insurance on our sole officer and director. IF OUR COMPANY IS DISSOLVED, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT ASSETS REMAINING TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. In the event of the dissolution of our company, the proceeds realized from the liquidation of our assets, if any, will be used primarily to pay the claims of our creditors, if any, before there can be any distribution to the shareholders. In that case, the ability of purchasers of the offered shares to recover all or any portion of the purchase price for the offered shares will depend on the amount of funds realized and the claims to be satisfied there from. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GAIN ANY SIGNIFICANT MARKET ACCEPTANCE FOR OUR SERVICE OR ESTABLISH A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PRESENCE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS. Our growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully market our service to prospective customers. However, our planned service may not achieve significant acceptance. Such acceptance, if achieved, may not be sustained for any significant period of time. Failure of our service to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of our operations. MANAGEMENT’S ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE BUSINESS STRATEGY MAY BE SLOWER THAN EXPECTED AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. Our plans include obtaining ENVOY GROUP CORP. (Adult Day Care Center) business which may not occur. Our growth strategy is subject to significant risks which you should carefully consider before purchasing the shares we are offering. Although we plan on offering our ENVOY GROUP CORP. (Adult Day Care Center) service carefully, the service may be slow to achieve profitability, or may not become profitable at all, which will result in losses. There can be no assurance that we will succeed. - 9 - We may be unable to enter into its intended markets successfully. The factors that could affect our growth strategy include our success in (a) developing the ENVOY GROUP CORP. business plan, (b) obtaining customers, (c) obtaining adequate financing on acceptable terms, and (d) adapting our internal controls and operating procedures to accommodate our future growth. Our systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support the expansion of our business operations. Significant growth will place managerial demands on all aspects of our operations. Our future operating results will depend substantially upon our ability to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our service, administrative and financial controls and reporting systems. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE OUR FUTURE GROWTH, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED AND WE MAY NOT BECOME PROFITABLE. Significant growth may place a significant strain on management, financial, operating and technical resources. Failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or the results of its operations. Since inception on April 8, 2013 to April 30, 2013, we have spent a total of approximately $92 on start-up costs. We have not generated any revenue from business operations. All proceeds currently held by us are the result of the sale of common stock to our sole officer. OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM CONSISTS OF ONE PERSON AND MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. We have not assembled our management team as a result of our relatively limited activities to date. In addition, we have only one management member which may be insufficient to run our operation. As a result, we may be unable to effectively develop and manage our business and we may fail. COMPETITORS MAY ENTER THIS SECTOR WITH SUPERIOR SERVICE, INFRINGING OUR CUSTOMER BASE, AND AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS ADVERSELY. We have identified a market opportunity for our business. Competitors may enter this sector with superior service. This would infringe on our customer base, having an adverse affect upon our business and the results of our operations. SINCE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR CURRENTLY OWNS 100% OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, INVESTORS MAY FIND THAT HER DECISIONS ARE CONTRARY TO THEIR INTERESTS. YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE SHARES UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO ENTRUST ALL ASPECTS OF MANAGEMENT TO OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR, OR HER SUCCESSORS. Our sole officer and director, Ms. Jocelyn Nicholas, owns 9,000,000 shares of common stock representing 100% of our outstanding stock. Ms. Nicholas will own 9,000,000 shares of our common stock after this offering is completed representing approximately 75% of our outstanding shares, assuming all securities are sold. As a result, she will have control of us even if the full offering is subscribed for and be able to choose all of our directors. Her interests may differ from the ones of other stockholders. Factors that could cause her interests to differ from the other stockholders include the impact of corporate transactions on the timing of business operations and her ability to continue to manage the business given the amount of time she is able to devote to us. All decisions regarding the management of our affairs will be made exclusively by her. Purchasers of the offered shares may not participate in our management and, therefore, are dependent upon her management abilities. The only assurance that our shareholders, including purchasers of the offered shares, have that our sole officer and director will not abuse her discretion in executing our business affairs, is her fiduciary obligation and business integrity. Such discretionary powers include, but are not limited to, decisions regarding all aspects of business operations, corporate transactions and financing. Ms. Nicholas also has the ability to accomplish or ratify actions at the shareholder level which would otherwise implicate her fiduciary duties if done as one of the members of our board of directors. Accordingly, no person should purchase the offered shares unless willing to entrust all aspects of management to the sole officer and director, or her successors. Potential purchasers of the offered shares must carefully evaluate the personal experience and business performance of our management. - 10 - Risks Related To Our Financial Condition WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A TIME TABLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH CASTS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ON THE VIABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. We anticipate that we will require a total of $575,000 ($575,000 in addition to the maximum of $37,500 that we are seeking to raise through this offering) in order to implement our business plan. What’s more, with the clear exception of the costs associated with this offering ($9,000) we anticipate that virtually all aspects of our business plan must be executed concurrently or near concurrently with each other in order for us to generate more than nominal revenues. Because we have taken no steps to identify potential sources of financing that we will require to execute our business plan we cannot estimate if or when we will obtain additional financing. Therefore, we are also unable to provide a timeline for the implementation of our business plan. Our inability to provide a timeline for the implementation of our business plan at this time casts substantial doubt on the viability of our business and will have an adverse impact on our ability to attract investors, which may cause the business to fail. Any investment in our business is therefore highly speculative. WE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY IN ANY DETAIL THE STEPS THAT WE WILL TAKE TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING REQUIRED TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH CASTS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ON THE ABILITY OF OUR MANAGEMENT TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. As of April 30, 2013 we had only nominal cash resources of $8,908 and we anticipate that we will require a total of $575,000 ($575,000 in addition to the maximum of $37,500 that we are seeking to raise through this offering) in order to implement our business plan. What’s more our sole officer and director has no experience in capital raising or identifying potential sources of financing for our business. Because our sole officer and director has no experience in capital raising or identifying potential sources of financing we are unable to identify in any detail the steps we will take to obtain the financing required to execute our business plan. Our inability to identify the steps we will take to obtain the financing we require casts doubt on the ability of our management to execute our business plan and on our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to identify and access sources of financing our business will fail and you will lose your investment. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AS A GOING CONCERN In their audit report dated May 13, 2013, our auditors have expressed an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Because our officer may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance any additional capital to us, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plan. Due to the fact that there is no minimum investment and no refunds on sold shares, you may be investing in a company that will not have the funds necessary to develop its business strategies. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment. See the Auditors Report accompanying our Audited Financial Statements. Because we have been issued an opinion by our auditor that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as a going concern it may be more difficult to attract investors. THE ENACTMENT OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS OR PREVENT US FROM BECOMING PROFITABLE. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) was enacted in response to public concern regarding corporate accountability in the wake of a number of accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, provide enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosure pursuant to applicable securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Upon becoming a public company, we will be required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has resulted in the imposition of a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase the responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officer, the perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting such roles. Consequently, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as our directors or executive officer, and we may need to incur additional operating costs. This could prevent us from becoming profitable. - 11 - SINCE WE ANTICIPATE OPERATING EXPENSES WILL INCREASE PRIOR TO EARNING REVENUE, WE MAY NEVER ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY We anticipate an increase in our operating expenses, without realizing any revenues from the sale of its service. Within the next 18 months, we will have costs related to (i) creating an ENVOY GROUP CORP. (Adult Day Care Center) service, (ii) initiation of our business plan, (iii) administrative expenses, and (iv) the expenses of this offering. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that our service will attract customers; generate any operating revenue or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unable to address these risks, there is a high probability that our business can fail, which will result in the loss of your entire investment. IF WE CANNOT SECURE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, OR IF AVAILABLE CAPITAL IS TOO EXPENSIVE, OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL. Developing and executing our business plan will require a significant capital investment. Debt or equity financing may not be available to us, or, if available, may be too expensive. Executing our business plan could require an initial investment of approximately $575,000 (in addition to the $37,500 capital raise from this offering) and we anticipate up to 18 months of operational losses at approximately $1,000 per month. We require $37,500 to begin implementing the business and marketing plan. This amount includes the $9,000 required for offering expense. We will require additional funding of approximately $575,000 (in addition to the $37,500 capital raise from this offering) to fully execute our business plan and bring our service to the marketplace. As of April 30, 2013, we had cash on hand of $8,908. No assurance can be given that we will obtain access to capital markets in the future or that adequate financing to satisfy the cash requirements of implementing our business strategies will be available on acceptable terms. Our inability to gain access to capital markets or obtain acceptable financing could have a material adverse effect upon the results of its operations and its financial conditions. If we are not successful in earning revenue once we have started our sales activity, we may require additional financing to sustain our business operations. Currently, we do not have any arrangements for financing and can provide no assurances to investors that we will be able to obtain any when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including our sales results. These factors may have an affect on the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing and make such additional financing unavailable to us. IF OUR REGISTRATION STATEMENT IS DECLARED EFFECTIVE, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SEC’S REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN THIS REPORTING STATUS WITH THE SEC. If our registration statement is declared effective, we will have a reporting obligation to the SEC. As of the date of this Prospectus, the funds currently available to us will not be sufficient to meet our reporting obligations. If we fail to meet our reporting obligations, we will lose our reporting status with the SEC. Our management believes that if we cannot maintain our reporting status with the SEC we will have to cease all efforts directed towards developing our company. In that event, any investment in the company could be lost in its entirety. Risks Related To This Offering BECAUSE THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL YOUR STOCK We intend to apply to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. This process takes at least 60 days and the application must be made on our behalf by a market maker. Our stock may be listed or traded only to the extent that there is interest by broker-dealers in acting as a market maker. Despite our best efforts, it may not be able to convince any broker/dealers to act as market-makers and make quotations on the OTC Bulletin Board. We may consider pursuing a listing on the OTCBB after this registration becomes effective and we have completed our offering. If our common stock becomes listed and a market for the stock develops, the actual price of our shares will be determined by prevailing market prices at the time of the sale. - 12 - We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock. The trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often sporadic and investors may have difficulty buying and selling our shares or obtaining market quotations for them, which may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. You may not be able to sell your shares at their purchase price or at any price at all. Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any shares you purchase from the selling security holders. INVESTING IN OUR COMPANY IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND COULD RESULT IN THE ENTIRE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT Purchasing the offered shares is highly speculative and involves significant risk. The offered shares should not be purchased by any person who cannot afford to lose their entire investment. Our business objectives are also speculative, and it is possible that we would be unable to accomplish them. Our shareholders may be unable to realize a substantial or any return on their purchase of the offered shares and may lose their entire investment. For this reason, each prospective purchaser of the offered shares should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney, business and/or investment advisor. INVESTING IN OUR COMPANY MAY RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE LOSS BECAUSE BUYERS WILL PAY MORE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK THAN THE PRO RATA PORTION OF THE ASSETS ARE WORTH We have only been recently formed and have only a limited operating history with no earnings; therefore, the price of the offered shares is not based on any data. The offering price and other terms and conditions regarding our shares have been arbitrarily determined and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. No investment banker, appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares. Our net tangible book value per share of common stock is $0.001 as of April 30, 2013, our most recent financial statement date. The arbitrary offering price of $0.0125 per share as determined herein is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our common stock. Our assets do not substantiate a share price of $0.0125. This premium in share price applies to the terms of this offering. The offering price will not change for the duration of the offering even if we obtain a listing on any exchange or become quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. BECAUSE WE HAVE 250,000,000 AUTHORIZED SHARES, MANAGEMENT COULD ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, DILUTING THE CURRENT SHARE HOLDERS’ EQUITY We have 250,000,000 authorized shares, of which only 9,000,000 are currently issued and outstanding and only 12,000,000 will be issued and outstanding after this offering terminates. Our management could, without the consent of the existing shareholders, issue substantially more shares, causing a large dilution in the equity position of our current shareholders. Additionally, large share issuances would generally have a negative impact on our share price. It is possible that, due to additional share issuance, you could lose a substantial amount, or all, of your investment. AS WE DO NOT HAVE AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR INVESTORS, IF WE FILE FOR OR ARE FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, INVESTORS WILL LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT Invested funds for this offering will not be placed in an escrow or trust account and if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws. As such, you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SO THERE WILL BE LESS WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN MAKE A GAIN ON ANY INVESTMENT IN US We have never paid dividends and do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we may require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may prohibit the declaration of dividends. Because we do not intend to pay dividends, any gain on your investment will need to result from an appreciation in the price of our common stock. There will therefore be fewer ways in which you are able to make a gain on your investment. IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE TRADED, THEY MAY TRADE UNDER $5.00 PER SHARE AND THUS WILL BE A PENNY STOCK. TRADING IN PENNY STOCKS HAS MANY RESTRICTIONS AND THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD SEVERELY AFFECT THE PRICE AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHARES - 13 - In the event that our shares are traded, and our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a “penny stock”, which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our common stock could be considered to be a “penny stock”. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the “penny stock” rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to. FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (“FINRA”) SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY ALSO LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES. FINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price. YOU MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE RESALE OF YOUR SHARES DUE TO STATE “BLUE SKY” LAWS. Each state has its own securities laws, often called “blue sky” laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state. We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. We have not yet applied to have our securities registered in any state and will not do so until we receive expressions of interest from investors resident in specific states after they have viewed this Prospectus. We will initially focus our offering in the state of Florida and will rely on exemptions found in section 517.061 of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification. STOCKHOLDERS MAY HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO INFORMATION BECAUSE WE ARE NOT YET A REPORTING ISSUER AND MAY NOT BECOME ONE. We do not intend to file a Form 8-A promptly after this registration statement becomes effective. We are not currently a reporting issuer and upon this registration statement becoming effective we will be required to comply only with the limited reporting obligations pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. These reporting obligations may be automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if on the first day of any fiscal year other than the fiscal year in which our registration statement became effective, there are fewer than 300 shareholders. If we do not become a reporting issuer and instead make a decision to suspend our public reporting, we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with SEC and your access to our business information will be restricted. In addition, if we do not become a reporting issuer, we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders, and our directors, officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. - 14 - USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.0125. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 35%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by us.

We will receive all proceeds from the sale of the common stock and intend to use the proceeds from this offering, to begin implementing the business and marketing plan. The expenses of this offering, including the preparation of this prospectus and the filing of this registration statement, estimated at $9,000 are being paid for by us. The maximum proceeds from this offering ($37,500) will satisfy our basic, subsistence level, cash requirements for up to 12 months including legal and accounting costs associated with this offering, the costs associated with our continuous disclosure obligations, incidental expenses, and the cost of implementing the investigative aspects of our business plan, including identifying and securing additional sources of financing, consultants, operating equipment, marketing and facility. 75% of the possible proceeds from this offering ($28,125) will satisfy our basic, subsistence level cash requirements for up to 28 months, while 50% of the proceeds ($18,750) will sustain us for up to 19 months, and 35% of the proceeds ($13,125) will sustain for up to 13 months. Our budgetary allocations may vary, however, depending upon the percentage of proceeds that we obtain from the offering. For example, we may determine that is it more beneficial to allocate funds toward securing potential financing and business opportunities in the short terms rather than to conserve funds to satisfy continuous disclosure requirements for a longer period. Nevertheless, if we are only successful in selling 35% or less of the shares being registered, we will dedicate all proceeds to satisfying our continuous disclosure requirements. We do not have adequate funds to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next eighteen months. We will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations. During the 12 months following the completion of this offering, we intend to implement our business and marketing plan. We believe we must raise a total of $575,000 to pay for expenses associated with our development over the next 18 months. - 15 - Therefore, the public offering price of the shares does not necessarily bear any relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative of prices that may prevail at any time or from time to time ion the public market for the common stock. You cannot be sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher then the offering price in this offering DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price for the shares in this offering was arbitrarily determined. In determining the initial public offering price of the shares we considered several factors including the following: · Our new business structure and operations as well as lack of client base; · Prevailing market conditions, including the history and prospects for our industry; · Majority of ENVOY GROUP CORP. recycling business companies are not public and market conditions tend to be harder on new businesses; · Our future prospects and the experience of our management; · Our capital structure. Therefore, the public offering price of the shares does not necessarily bear any relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative of prices that may prevail at any time or from time to time in the public market for the common stock. You cannot be sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering price in this offering. DILUTION OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.0125 per share. This price (which is the equivalent of $ 0.0125 per common share) is significantly greater than the price paid by our sole officer and director. Our sole officer and director paid $0.001 per share, a difference of $0.0115 per share lower than the share price in this offering. Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders. Existing stockholders if all of the shares are sold Price per share $ 0.0125 Net tangible book value per share before offering $ .0010 Potential gain to existing shareholders $ .0029 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ .0039 Increase to present stockholders in net tangible book value per share after offering $ .0029 Capital contributions $ 37,500 Capital contribution by officer & director on April 8, 2013 $ 9,000 Number of shares outstanding before the offering 9,000,000 Number of shares after offering held by existing stockholder 9,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 75% - 16 - New shareholders if all of the shares are sold PERCENTAGE OF SHARES SOLD DILUTION TO NEW SHAREHOLDERS 35% 50% 75% 100% Per share offering price $ 0.0125 $ 0.0125 $ 0.0125 $ 0.0125 Net tangible book value per share before offering $ 0.0010 $ 0.0010 $ 0.0010 $ 0.0010 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0022 $ 0.0026 $ 0.0033 $ 0.0039 Increase in book value attributable to new shareholders $ 0.0012 $ 0.0016 $ 0.0023 $ 0.0029 Dilution to new shareholders 17.5 % 21.1 % 26.3 % 30.9 % THE OFFERING We are registering 3,000,000 shares of our common stock for offer and sale at $0.0125 per share. There is currently no active trading market for our common stock, and such a market may not develop or be sustained. We currently plan to have our common stock listing on the OTC Bulletin Board, subject to the effectiveness of this Registration Statement. In addition, a market maker will be required to file a Form 211 with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) before the market maker will be able to make a market in the shares of our common stock. At the date hereof, we are not aware that any market maker has any such intention. We may not sell the shares registered herein until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. Further, we will not offer the shares through a broker-dealer or anyone affiliated with a broker-dealer. Upon effectiveness, all of the shares being registered herein may become tradable. The stock may be traded or listed only to the extent that there is interest by broker-dealers in acting as a market maker in our stock. Despite our best efforts, it may not be able to convince any broker/dealers to act as market-makers and make quotations on the OTC Bulletin Board.

PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS The following table sets forth, as of the date of this prospectus, the total number of shares owned beneficially by our sole officer and director, and key employees, individually and as a group, and the present owners of 5% or more of our total outstanding shares. The stockholder listed below has direct ownership of her shares and possesses sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares.

For the period ended April 30, 2013, a total of 9,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale, commencing one year after their acquisition. Under Rule 144, a shareholder can sell up to 1% of total outstanding shares every three months in brokers’ transactions. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering. - 18 - Our sole officer and director will continue to own the majority of our common stock after the offering, regardless of the number of shares sold. Since he will continue control our company after the offering, investors in this offering will be unable to change the course of our operations. Thus, the shares we are offering lack the value normally attributable to voting rights. This could result in a reduction in value of the shares you own because of their ineffective voting power. None of our common stock is subject to outstanding options, warrants, or securities convertible into common stock. The company is hereby registering 3,000,000 of its common shares, in addition to the 9,000,000 shares currently issued and outstanding. The price per share is $0.01 (please see “Plan of Distribution” above).

We issued a total of 9,000,000 common shares for consideration of $9,000, which was accounted for as a purchase of common stock. The Company received $9,000 cash. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES Common Stock The authorized common stock is two hundred and fifty million (250,000,000) shares with a par value of $0.0001. Shares of our common stock: · have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our Board of Directors; · are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; · do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights; and · are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote. We refer you to our Bylaws, our Articles of Incorporation, and the applicable statutes of the State of Florida for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities. Non-Cumulative Voting Holders of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in that event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. After this offering is completed, present stockholders will own approximately 75% of our outstanding shares. Cash Dividends As of the date of this Prospectus, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions.

REQUIREMENT $ 575,000 Competition We believe that the principal methods of competition in the company’s intended market are the traditional local and regional adult day care companies.

We believe that ENVOY GROUP CORP. intents to enter into this market place to address problems with solutions. The National traditional companies have the finances and resources to become major players in this market if they elect to do so. We believe that there is a huge growing need for new types of companies to enter into this market to provide adult day care services. However we believe, ENVOY GROUP CORP. services may provide success in this market segment. - 22 - Employees and Employment Agreements As of April 8, 2013, we have no employees other than Ms. Nicholas, our sole officer and director.

JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things: Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies; Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; - 23 - Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements. In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of (i) the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (ii) the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO; (iii) the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or (iv) the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below. Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows: (i) audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years; (ii) selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited; (iii) executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter) However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations. The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule. The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit. Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes. Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO. - 24 - Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow. Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We know of no materials, active or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceedings or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any beneficial shareholder are an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to us. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Market Information Our common stock is not traded on any exchange. We intend to apply to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board once this Prospectus has been declared effective by the SEC; however, there is no guarantee that we will obtain a listing. There is currently no trading market for our common stock and there is no assurance that a regular trading market will ever develop. OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed and traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. To have our common stock listed on any of the public trading markets, including the OTC Bulletin Board, we will require a market maker to sponsor our securities. We have not yet engaged any market maker to sponsor our securities, and there is no guarantee that our securities will meet the requirements for quotation or that our securities will be accepted for listing on the OTC Bulletin Board. This could prevent us from developing a trading market for our common stock. Holders As of the date of this Prospectus there was one holder of record of our common stock. Dividends To date, we have not paid dividends on shares of our common stock and we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of any dividends will depend upon our future earnings, if any, our financial condition, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Equity Compensation Plans As of the date of this Prospectus we did not have any equity compensation plans. - 25 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section of the prospectus includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “project” and similar expressions, or words that, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (USD or US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. All references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock. Overview We are a development-stage company, incorporated in the State of Florida on April 8, 2013, as a for-profit company, and an established fiscal year of April 30. We have not yet generated or realized any revenues from business operations. Our auditor has issued a going concerned opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next eighteen (18) months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. Accordingly, we must raise cash from other sources other than loans we undertake. From inception (April 8, 2013) through April 30, 2013, our business operations have primarily been focused on developing our business plan. We have spent a total of approximately $ 2,598 on start-up costs. We have not generated any revenue from business operations. All cash held by us is the result of the sale of common stock to our sole director and officer. The proceeds from this offering will satisfy our cash requirements for up to 40 months. If we are unable to raise additional monies, we only have enough capital to cover the costs of this offering and to begin implementing the business and marketing plan. The expenses of this offering include the preparation of this prospectus, the filing of this registration statement and transfer agent fees and developing the business plan. As of April 30, 2013 we had $8,908 cash on hand. Plan of Operations We anticipate that the $37,500 we intend to raise in this offering will be sufficient to enable us to investigation and analysis of what operating equipment, office equipment, consulting team, marketing and facility necessary to operate an electronic waste facility. Efforts will be proportional to funds raised to achieve these results. Raising less than the $37,500 will decrease funds for the investigation and analysis. The first money raised, of course, will be set aside and used for meeting our reporting requirements to the Securities Exchange Commission and the State of Florida. Our business plan and allocation of proceeds will vary to accommodate the amount of proceeds raised by the sale of securities hereunder and through other financing efforts. The Use of Proceeds table shows an increase in funds allocated to each category of expenses under our business plan somewhat in proportion to the percentage of shares sold (whether 35%, 50%, 75% or 100%). Initially, we intend to investigate the types of operating and office equipment required. We intend to interview consultants in the operation of our facility as well as marketing and advertising agencies to assist in developing the electronic waste operations and marketing plans, but would not engage these service providers unless and until sufficient funds were raised. but again would not engage these service providers unless and until sufficient funds were raised and then the terms of the engagement would be dependent upon amount of capital available. Initially, Ms. Nicholas will provide her office computer and office equipment at no cost. However, we estimate that we will require as much as $575,000 ($575,000 in addition to the maximum of $37,500 that we are seeking to raise through this offering) in order to establish operations of a sufficient size and quality to ensure the competitiveness of our business and to generate significant revenues to support an office outside Ms. Nicholas’s office. Nevertheless, if our potential to raise capital appears exhausted, our management may decide to modify our business plan on a reduced scale and quality. A decision by management to implement our business plan on a reduced scale and quality may occur at any juncture during the early stages of our business development, whether we have raised 35%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the proceeds that we will be seeking to raise through this offering. We believe we do not have adequate funds to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next twelve months. We will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations. During the 18 months following the completion of this offering, we intend to implement our business and marketing plan. We believe we must raise an additional $575,000 (in addition to this $37,500 capital raise) to pay for expenses associated with our development over the next 18 months. $575,000 (in addition to this $37,500 capital raise) will be used to finance anticipated activities. - 26 - As of April 30, 2013, we had cash on hand of $8,908. With life expectancy rising, more and more seniors will need assistance as they age. Envoy Group Corp. intends to be developed for seniors who can no longer manage independently, or who are isolated and lonely. We intend to provide seniors with a program to socialize with others while still receiving needed care services.

We believe that it will cost approximately $575,000 (in addition to the $37,500 capital raise) to execute the ENVOY GROUP CORP. service. There can be no assurance that we will be able secure financing or if offered that it will be on terms acceptable to us. In the event that we are unable to secure adequate financing we will not be able to develop the ENVOY GROUP CORP. service. Since inception, we have incurred a net loss of approximately $92. We believe that it will cost approximately $575,000 (subsequent to the $37,500 capital raise) to execute the ENVOY GROUP CORP. service. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure financing or if offered that it will be on terms acceptable to us. In the event we are unable to secure adequate financing we will not be able to develop the ENVOY GROUP CORP. service. - 28 - We intend to pursue capital through public or private financing in order to finance our businesses activities. We cannot guarantee that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then our ability to continue our operations may be significantly hindered. We have not yet begun the development of any of our anticipated service and even if we do secure adequate financing, there can be no assurance that our service will be accepted by the marketplace and that we will be able to generate revenues. Our management does not plan to hire any employees at this time. Our sole officer and director will be responsible for the business plan development. Results of Operations There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have incurred expenses of $92 on our operations as of April 30, 2013 and our only other activity consisted of the sale of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock to our sole director and officer for aggregate proceeds of $9,000. We have not generated any revenues from our operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us for the implementation of our business strategies. (See “Risk Factors”). To become profitable and competitive, we must develop the business plan and execute the plan. Our management will attempt to secure financing through various means including borrowing and investment from institutions and private individuals. Since inception, the majority of our time has been spent refining its business plan and preparing for a primary financial offering. Our results of operations are summarized below: April 8, 2013 (Inception) To April 30, 2013 (Audited) Revenue — Cost of Revenue — Expenses $ 92 Net Loss - $ (92 ) Net Loss per Share - Basic and Diluted (0.00 ) Weighted Average Number Shares Outstanding - Basic and Diluted 9,000,000 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of the date of this prospectus, we had yet to generate any revenues from our business operations. For the period ended April 30, 2013, we issued 9,000,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director for cash proceeds of $9,000. Our current cash on hand is $6,402 which will be used to meet our current obligations. However, our current cash is not sufficient to meet the new obligations associated with being a company that is fully reporting with the SEC. Based on our disclosure above under “Use of Proceeds,” we anticipate that any level of capital raised above 35% will allow us minimal operations for a eighteen month period while meeting our state and SEC required compliance obligations. Nonetheless, even the sale of 100% of the securities in this offering will not provide sufficient capital to fully implement the business plan, but it will provide for vetting of the business plan to support pursuing investment capital. Our current cash on hand is $6,402, which is allocated to cover the expenses associated with this offering. Accordingly, we anticipate that our current cash on hand is not sufficient to meet the new obligations associated with being a company that is fully reporting with the SEC. However, to the extent that we do not expend the entire cash on hand on this offering, the remaining cash will be allocated to cover these new reporting company obligations, and our “Use of Proceeds” would be adjusted accordingly. Nonetheless, based on our disclosure above under “Use of Proceeds,” which is based on utilizing the entire cash on hand for this offering, we anticipate that any level of capital raised above 35% will allow us minimal operations for a twelve month period while meeting our State and SEC required compliance obligations. Although, the sale of 100% of the securities in this offering will not provide sufficient capital to fully implement the business plan, it will provide for vetting of the business plan to support pursuing investment capital. - 29 - We anticipate needing $575,000 (subsequent to this $37,500 capital raise) in order to effectively execute our business plan over the next eighteen months. Currently available cash is not sufficient to allow us to commence full execution of our business plan. Our business expansion will require significant capital resources that may be funded through the issuance of common stock or of notes payable or other debt arrangements that may affect our debt structure. Despite our current financial status we believe that we may be able to issue notes payable or debt instruments in order to start executing our business plan. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise money in this fashion and have not entered into any agreements that would obligate a third party to provide us with capital. Through April 30, 2013, we spent $92 on general and administrative operating expenses. We raised the cash amounts to be used in these activities from the sale of common stock to our sole officer and director. We currently have accrued liabilities of $2,500 and working capital of $6,402. As of April 30, 2013 we had $8,908 cash on hand. To date, the Company has managed to keep our monthly cash flow requirement low for two reasons. First, our sole officer does not draw a salary at this time. Second, the Company has been able to keep our operating expenses to a minimum by operating in space owned by our sole officer. As of the date of this registration statement, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status. Management believes if the Company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety. The Company currently has no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions or off-balance sheet arrangements that will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate access to capital. The Sole director and officer has made no commitments written or oral, with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees. If the Company is unable to raise the funds partially through this offering the Company will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to keep costs from being more than these estimated amounts or that the Company will be able to raise such funds. Even if we sell all shares offered through this registration statement, we expect that the Company will seek additional financing in the future. However, the Company may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, the Company may be forced to seek a buyer for our business or another entity with which we could create a joint venture. If all of these alternatives fail, we expect that the Company will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws. Our independent auditor has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and believes that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues. See Note 2 of our financial statements. Recent Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or The NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors’ independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. Our Board of Directors is comprised of one individual who is also our executive officer. Our executive officer makes decisions on all significant corporate matters such as the approval of terms of the compensation of our executive officer and the oversight of the accounting functions. - 30 - Although the Company has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct the Company has not yet adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, the Company is not required to do so. The Company has not adopted corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committees of our board of directors as we presently do not have any independent directors. If we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors, the Company may seek to establish an audit and other committees of our board of directors. It is possible that if our Board of Directors included independent directors and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officer and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders. Inflation The effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant. Significant Accounting Policies Our financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete listing of these policies is included in Note 3 of the notes to our financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2013. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by management. The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b)(2)(B) of the Act. Among other things, this means that the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, the Company may elect not to provide certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers that would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the Company. As a result, investor confidence in the Company and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected Use of Estimates : The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Research and Development Expenses: Expenditures for research and development will be expensed as incurred. Earnings (Loss) Per Share : Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares may consist of incremental shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and the conversion of notes payable to common stock. In periods in which a net loss has been incurred, all potentially dilutive common shares are considered antidilutive and thus are excluded from the calculation. At April 30, 2013 the Company did not have any potentially dilutive common shares. - 31 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Messineo & Co, CPAs, LLC has audited our Financial Statements for the period from April 8, 2013 (date of inception) through April 30, 2013 and to the extent set forth in its report, which are included herein in reliance upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing. There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim period. CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS On April 8, 2013 we adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which is applicable to our employees and which also includes a Code of Ethics for our CEO and principal financial officer and persons performing similar functions. A code of ethics is a written standard designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote · honest and ethical conduct, · full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in regulatory filings and public statements, · compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, · the prompt reporting violation of the code, and · accountability for adherence to the code. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to this S-1 filing. Any person desiring a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, can obtain one by going to Edgar and looking at the attachments to our this S-1 filing. MANAGEMENT Officer and Director Our sole officer and director will serve until her successor is elected and qualified. Our officers are elected by the board of directors to a term of one (1) year and serve until their successor is duly elected and qualified, or until they are removed from office. The board of directors has no nominating, auditing or compensation committees. The name, address, age and position of our president, secretary/treasurer, and director and vice president is set forth below: NAME AND ADDRESS AGE POSITION(S) Jocelyn Nicholas 3811 Alden Way Sarasota, FL. 34232 44 President, Secretary/ Treasurer, Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and sole member of the Board of Directors The person named above has held her offices/positions since the inception of our company and is expected to hold her offices/positions until the next annual meeting of our stockholders. Business Experience JOCELYN NICHOLAS, SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR Ms. Nicholas is our founder and has served as our sole officer and director since our inception. She has over 15 years experience in the Spa field as a Message Therapist, Esthetician, Hair Stylist, and Nail Specialist. From 2002-2004 she was a Nail Technician and Hair Stylist for Allure Salon, Sarasota, FL, 2005-Present she is a Owner/Operator of Tranquil Moments, Sarasota, FL. Ms. Nicholas launched and managed Tranquil Moments Day Spa providing massage therapy, esthetician services, hair styling, manicures, pedicures specializing with clients of all ages. Ms. Nicholas also provided mobile spa services to assisted living facilities for the elderly. She received her hair styling and cosmetology degree from Capri School of Hair Design, 1987, Nail Specialist diploma from Fashion Focus, 1999, Massage Therapist diploma from Sarasota School of Massage Therapy, 2006 and Esthetician diploma from Sarasota County Technical Institute, 2012. - 32 - CONFLICTS OF INTEREST As of April 30, 2013, we have no employees. Ms. Nicholas, our founder, Sole officer and director, currently devotes 10 to 25 hours per week to our business as required from time to time without compensation. We have not entered into any formal agreement with Ms. Nicholas regarding the provision of her services to the Company. Ms. Nicholas is not obligated to commit her full time and attention to our business and accordingly, she may encounter a conflict of interest in allocating her time between our operations and those of other businesses. Presently, Ms. Nicholas earns her livelihood as a owner of a Tranquil Moments Day Spa. Although Ms. Nicholas is presently able to devote 10 to 25 hours per week to our business while maintaining her own livelihood, this may change. Also, if we require Ms. Nicholas to devote more than 10 to 25 hours per week to our business on a regular basis for an extended period, it is uncertain that she will be able to satisfy our requirements unless we have sufficient resources to compensate her for any lost income from her livelihood. In general, officers and directors of a corporation are required to present business opportunities to the corporation if: · the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity; · the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; and · it would be unfair to the corporation and its stockholders not to bring the opportunity to the attention of the corporation. COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our sole director has not established any committees, including an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee or a Nominating Committee, or any committee performing a similar function. The functions of those committees are being undertaken by our sole director. Because we do not have any independent directors, our sole director believes that the establishment of committees of the Board would not provide any benefits to our company and could be considered more form than substance. We do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates that may be recommended by our stockholders, including the minimum qualifications for director candidates, nor has our sole director established a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees. We have not adopted a policy regarding the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates by our stockholders, including the procedures to be followed. Our sole director has not considered or adopted any of these policies as we have never received a recommendation from any stockholder for any candidate to serve on our Board of Directors. Given our relative size and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage, we do not anticipate that any of our stockholders will make such a recommendation in the near future. While there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed, in the event such a proposal is made, all current members of our Board will participate in the consideration of director nominees. Our sole director is not an “audit committee financial expert” within the meaning of Item 401(e) of Regulation S-K. In general, an “audit committee financial expert” is an individual member of the audit committee or Board of Directors who: · understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements, · is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves, · has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our financial statements, · understands internal controls over financial reporting, and · understands audit committee functions. - 33 - Our Board of Directors is comprised of solely of Ms. Nicholas who was integral to our formation and who is involved in our day to day operations. While we would prefer to have an audit committee financial expert on our board of directors, Ms. Nicholas does not have a professional background in finance or accounting. As with most small, early stage companies until such time our company further develops its business, achieves a stronger revenue base and has sufficient working capital to purchase directors and officers insurance, the Company does not have any immediate prospects to attract independent directors. When the Company is able to expand our Board of Directors to include one or more independent directors, the Company intends to establish an Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. It is our intention that one or more of these independent directors will also qualify as an audit committee financial expert. Our securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our Board members be independent and the Company is not currently otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our Board of Directors include “independent” directors, nor are we required to establish or maintain an Audit Committee or other committee of our Board of Directors. We do not have any independent directors and the Company has not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, stockholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Title XXXVI, Chapter 607, of the Florida Statutes (the “Florida Business Corporation Act”) permits, but does not require, corporations to indemnify a director, officer or control person of the corporation for any liability asserted against her and liability and expenses incurred by her in his capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or arising out of her status as such, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, whether or not the corporation has provided for indemnification in its Articles of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation have no separate provision for indemnification of directors, officers, or control persons. Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Florida law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION We have made no provisions for paying cash or non-cash compensation to our sole officer and director. No salaries are being paid at the present time, no salaries or other compensation were paid in cash, or otherwise, for services performed prior to April 8, , 2013 our date of inception, and no compensation will be paid unless and until our operations generate sufficient cash flows. The table below summarizes all compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to our named executive officer for all services rendered in all capacities to us for the period from inception April 8, 2013 through April 30, 2013.

The committee would have the power to modify, extend or renew outstanding options and to authorize the grant of new options in substitution therefore, provided that any such action may not impair any rights under any option previously granted.

There are no arrangements pursuant to which our Sole director is or will be compensated in the future for any services provided as a director. - 35 - We do not have any agreements for compensating our directors for their services in their capacity as directors, although such directors are expected in the future to receive stock options to purchase shares of our common stock as awarded by our board of directors.

Sarasota, FL. We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of ENVOY GROUP CORP. (a development stage entity) as of April 30, 2013 and the related statement of operations, stockholder’s equity and cash flows for the period from April 8, 2013 (date of inception) through April 30, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as, evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ENVOY GROUP CORP. (a development stage entity) as of April 30, 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from April 8, 2013 (date of inception) through April 30, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred a loss, has not generated revenue, has not emerged from the development stage, and may be unable to raise further equity. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Messineo & Co, CPAs, LLC Clearwater, Florida May 13, 2013 F-2 ENVOY GROUP CORP.

F-6 ENVOY GROUP CORP. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Audited Financial Statements For the Period from April 8, 2013 (Date of Inception) through April 30, 2013 NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS ENVOY GROUP CORP. (the “Company”), a Florida corporation, was formed to develop an ENVOY GROUP CORP. It is the company’s intent to develop a service to provide ADULT DAYCARE CENTER business. The Company was incorporated on April 8, 2013 (Date of Inception) with its corporate headquarters located in Sarasota, Florida and its year-end is April 30, 2013. NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the period ended April 30, 2013, the Company had no operations. As of April 30, 2013, the Company has not emerged from the development stage. In view of these matters, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The significant accounting policies followed are: USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company’s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS All cash, other than held in escrow, is maintained with a major financial institution in the United States. Deposits with this bank may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND VALUATION ALLOWANCE The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740 “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of FASB ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under FASB ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. F-7 ENVOY GROUP CORP. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Audited Financial Statements For the Period from April 8, 2013 (Date of Inception) through April 30, 2013 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Expenditures for research, development, and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. There has been no research and development cost incurred for the period April 8, 2013 (date of inception) through April 30, 2013. COMMON STOCK The Company records common stock issuances when all of the legal requirements for the issuance of such common stock have been satisfied. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earning or loss per share. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and diluted potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised. Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at April 30, 2013. As of April 30, 2013, the Company had no dilutive potential common shares. REVENUE AND COST RECOGNITION The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore the Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost. ADVERTISING Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. There has been no advertising cost incurred for the three months ended April 30, 2013 or for the period April 8, 2013 (date of inception) through April 30, 2013. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements. NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES The Company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The tax benefit for the periods presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses and other temporary differences, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not. For the period April 8, 2013 (date of inception) through April 30, 2013, the Company incurred losses of $92. The net operating loss, resulting from operating activities, result in deferred tax assets at the effective statutory rates. The deferred tax asset has been off-set by an equal valuation allowance.

(A Development Stage Company) Notes to Audited Financial Statements For the Period from April 8, 2013 (Date of Inception) through April 30, 2013 April 8, 2013 (Date of Inception) through April 30, 2013 Tax benefit at U.S. statutory rate $ — State income tax benefit, net of federal benefit. — — Valuation allowance — $ — The Company did not have any temporary differences for the period from April 8, 2013 (Date of Inception) through April 30, 2013. NOTE 5. SHAREHOLDER’S EQUITY COMMON STOCK The authorized common stock of the Company consists of 250,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.0001. The Company issued 9,000,000 shares of our $.0001 par value common stock to Jocelyn Nicholas, our CEO and sole director, on April 8, 2013 for cash in the amount of $9,000 (per share price of $0.001). There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock of the Company. NOTE 6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On April 8, 2013, the Company sold 9,000,000 shares of common stock to its founder for $0.001 per share. The officer and director of the Company is or may be involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities that become available. He may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. The Company does not own or lease property or lease office space. The office space used by the Company was arranged by the founder of the Company to use at no charge. The above is not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would have been incurred had a comparable transaction been entered into with independent parties. NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCY From time to time the Company may be a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. Management believes that there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. NOTE 8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Management has evaluated subsequent events through May 17, 2013, the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Management is not aware of any significant events that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date that would have a material effect on the financial statements thereby requiring adjustment or disclosure. F-9 PART II. INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN THE PROSPECTUS OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION The registrant will pay for all expenses incurred by this offering. Whether or not all of the offered shares are sold, these expenses are estimated as follows: Securities and Exchange Commission registration fee $ 5 Federal Taxes $ — State Taxes and Fees $ — Listing Fees $ — Printing Fees $ 495 Transfer Agent Fees $ 1,625 Accounting fees and expenses $ 2,625 Legal fees and expenses $ 4,250 TOTAL $ 9,000 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Title XXXVI, Chapter 607, of the Florida Statutes (the “Florida Business Corporation Act”) permits, but does not require, corporations to indemnify a director, officer or control person of the corporation for any liability asserted against her and liability and expenses incurred by her in her capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or arising out of her status as such, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, whether or not the corporation has provided for indemnification in its Articles of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation have no separate provision for indemnification of directors, officers, or control persons. Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Florida law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES During the last three fiscal years we have had the following issuances of unregistered securities: (a) On April 8, 2013, we issued 9,000,000 shares to Ms. Jocelyn Nicholas, the Company’s founder, in exchange for cash of $9,000. We relied upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts from registration “transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering It is our belief Ms. Nicholas had such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that she was capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment and therefore did not need the protections offered their shares under Securities and Act of 1933, as amended. Ms. Nicholas certified that she was purchasing the shares for their own accounts, with investment intent. This offering was not accompanied by general advertisement or general solicitation and the shares were issued with a Rule 144 restrictive legend.

That for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act, each post—effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; 3. To remove from registration by means of a post—effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering; and 4.

Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 5.

II-2 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
