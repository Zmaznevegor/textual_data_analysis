We provide lead generation and customer acquisition solutions via our network of financial, news, and business networking portals, and also through real simple syndication, or RSS feeds, blogs, targeted e-mail, banners, search engine optimization, debt settlement referrals, and co-registration opportunities. We also provide our content to other companies in a variety of formats including re-branded portals, investor relations pages, and RSS feeds. We primarily make money from the following three lines of business: (1) Online advertising - We make our content network available without charge to users, and we generate revenue through the sale of display advertisements; advertisers pay us a fee each time a user views or clicks on an ad displayed within our content network; (2) Debt settlement referrals - We receive fees for providing sales and marketing support in connection with debt settlement solutions offered by debt settlement agencies to consumers in the United States; and (3) Lead generation - Utilizing our internally designed and developed lead generation platform, we provide reputable vendors of notable products and services with opportunities to contact qualified and interested potential customers, essentially crafting high-quality new-business leads for the product and service vendors, i.e., delivering buyers to sellers, in return for the lead fees we receive as our compensation. We own and operate an extensive portfolio of 6,477 domain names (commonly referred to as URLs), and we use this portfolio to build consumer-based portals, microsites, and landing pages which are attractive and useful to our users because of the unique information items therein offered. This drives significant new and recurring user traffic to our websites and allows us to generate highly relevant responses and leads for our online advertising, debt settlement referral, and lead generation customers. Financial Information We reported a net loss of approximately $2.4 million during 2006, and $3.3 million during 2007. Our revenues may not be adequate to fund future operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Going Concern” incorporated by reference herein from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES Common Stock We are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share. As of May 6, 2008 we had 23,901,261 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. Our Common Stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of security holders, including the election of directors. There is no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. The holders of Common Stock are entitled to any dividends that may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for payment of dividends subject to the prior rights of holders of Preferred Stock and any contractual restrictions we have against the payment of dividends on Common Stock. In the event of our liquidation or dissolution, holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. Holders of Common Stock have no preemptive rights and have no right to convert their Common Stock into any other securities Preferred Stock We are authorized to issue 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $.001 par value, and as of May 6, 2008 we have issued 54,000 shares of 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 118,875 shares of 8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, our board of directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue Preferred Stock in one or more series from time to time and fix or alter the designations, relative rights, priorities, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the shares of each series. The rights, preferences, limitations and restrictions of different series of Preferred Stock may differ with respect to dividend rates, amounts payable on liquidation, voting rights, conversion rights, redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions and other matters. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to our Common Stock for the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation. In addition, our board of directors can fix limitations and restrictions, if any, upon the payment of dividends on our Common Stock to be effective while any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding. The rights granted to the holders of any series of Preferred Stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of Common Stock and issuance of Preferred Stock may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control. The designations, rights and preferences of the 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provide: · the stated value of each share is $15.00, · the shares pay cumulative dividends of 10% per annum payable quarterly on each of September 1, December 1, March 1 and June 1 commencing on September 1, 2006. Dividends are payable at our option in cash or shares of our Common Stock valued at $0.15 per share; · the shares carry a liquidation preference equal to the stated value plus any accrued but unpaid dividends; 14 · the shares are entitled to vote together with our Common Stock on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Each share of the 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of our Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock; · we cannot sell any shares of Common Stock for a consideration per share less than $0.15, nor issue any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock at an exercise or conversion price below $0.15 per share, without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding. Excluded from this limitation is the issuance of stock options to our management and employees under a qualified stock option plan; · the shares are not redeemable by us nor are they subject to any call option; and · each share of 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $0.15 per share subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends and reclassifications. In the event a public market is established for our common shares, the shares of 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are subject to mandatory conversion by us upon 30 days notice if the average closing price of our Common Stock is $0.40 or more per share for 10 consecutive trading days and the average daily volume is at least 100,000 shares. The designations, rights and preferences of the 8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock provide: · the stated value of each share is $35.00; · the shares pay cumulative dividends of 8% per annum payable quarterly on each of September 1, December 1, March 1 and June 1 commencing on December 1, 2007.

Excluded from this limitation are the issuance of Common Stock as dividend to our 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Holders and issuance of stock options to our management and employees under a qualified stock option plan; · the shares are redeemable by us at any time after June 1, 2012, at a redemption price of $52.50 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends as of the redemption date; and · each share of 8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $0.35 per share subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends and reclassifications. In the event a public market is established for our common shares, the shares of 8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are subject to mandatory conversion by us upon 30 days notice if the average closing price of our Common Stock is $1.00 or more per share for 10 consecutive trading days. The issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by stockholders and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of Common Stock. In certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could depress the market price of the Common Stock. 15 Warrants As of May 6, 2008, Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,899,375 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding. Our Warrants are exercisable for 7 years and expire between 2012 and 2014, with exercise prices ranging from $0.15 to $0.35 per share. All Warrants contain a cashless exercise provision, which permits the holder, rather than paying the exercise price in cash, to surrender a number of Warrants, the shares underlying which have a market value equal to the exercise price of the Warrants being exercised. The exercise price of the Warrants and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants is subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and reorganizations, or in the event we issue shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exchange for shares of our Common Stock at an effective price less than the then exercise price of the Warrants in which event the exercise price would be adjusted downward. Options On December 15, 2006 our board of directors and shareholders adopted the Accelerize New Media, Inc. Stock Option Plan, or the Plan. As of May 6, 2008, options to purchase 7,451,000 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding under the Plan. The purpose of the Plan, is to encourage employees, directors and other individuals (whether or not employees) who render services to Accelerize and its subsidiaries. The Plan is administered by the board of directors. The board determines to whom options shall be granted under the Plan, whether options granted are intended to be incentive stock options, or ISOs, or nonqualified stock options, or NSOs, the terms of the options and the number of shares of Common Stock that may be granted under the Plan. The board may delegate to the Compensation Committee of the board, if any, the authority of the board to make determinations and to take the aforementioned actions. The total number of our shares that may be subject to options under the Plan is 10,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. In certain circumstances, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to options that may be granted to any individual in the aggregate in any calendar year may not exceed 2,000,000 shares. Shares of Common Stock subject to an option that is not fully exercised prior to its expiration or other termination shall again become available for grant under the terms of the Plan. Each option will expire ten years from its date of grant, provided that no ISO granted to an employee who owns stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the company or any subsidiary will expire later than five years from its date of grant.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The selling security holders and any of their pledgees, donees, transferees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of Common Stock on the OTC Bulletin Board, at fixed or negotiated prices or in any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. The selling security holders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: · ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits investors; · block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; · purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; · an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; · privately negotiated transactions; · to cover short sales made after the date that the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part is declared effective by the SEC; · through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; 16 · broker-dealers may agree with the selling security holder to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; · a combination of any such methods of sale; and · any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The selling security holders may also sell shares in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including under Rule 144 thereunder, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the selling security holders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling security holders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. The selling security holders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. The selling security holders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell shares of Common Stock from time to time under this prospectus, or under an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act of 1933 amending the list of selling security holders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling security holders under this prospectus. In connection with the sale of our Common Stock or interests therein, the selling security holders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the Common Stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling security holders may also sell shares of our Common Stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the Common Stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling security holders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). Upon the company being notified in writing by a selling security holder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of Common Stock through a block trade, special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, a supplement to this prospectus will be filed, if required, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, disclosing (i) the name of each such selling security holder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), (ii) the number of shares involved, (iii) the price at which such the shares of Common Stock were sold, (iv) the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable, (v) that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and (vi) other facts material to the transaction. In addition, upon the company being notified in writing by a selling security holder that a donee or pledgee intends to sell shares of Common Stock, a supplement to this prospectus will be filed if then required in accordance with applicable securities law. The selling security holders also may transfer the shares of Common Stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. The selling security holders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be ‘‘underwriters’’ within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Discounts, concessions, commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, that can be attributed to the sale of securities will be paid by the selling security holders and/or the purchasers. Each selling security holder has represented and warranted to the company that it acquired the securities subject to this registration statement in the ordinary course of such selling security holder’s business and, at the time of its purchase of such securities such selling security holder had no agreements or understandings, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute any such securities. Skyebanc, Inc., one of the selling security holders, is a registered broker-dealer and is an underwriter, as set forth above in note 55 under “Selling Security Holders.” The company has advised each selling security holder that it may not use shares registered on the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part to cover short sales of Common Stock made prior to the date on which the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part shall have been declared effective by the SEC. If a selling security holders uses this prospectus for any sale of the Common Stock, it will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. The selling security holders will be responsible for complying with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules and regulations thereunder promulgated, including, without limitation, Regulation M, as applicable to such selling security holders in connection with resales of their respective shares under the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. 17 The company is required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the shares, but the company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock. LEGAL MATTERS The validity of the securities offered by this prospectus has been passed upon for us by Sullivan & Worcester LLP, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10104. Members and employees of this firm own an aggregate of 177,682 shares of our Common Stock, 1,333 shares of our 10% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 1,500 shares of our 8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and Warrants to purchase 72,500 shares of our Common Stock. EXPERTS The financial statements as of December 31, 2007 and for the two years then ended included by being incorporated by reference in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part have been audited by Sherb & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, and have been so included in reliance upon the report of such firm given their authority as experts in accounting and auditing. 18 PART II INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN THE PROSPECTUS Item 13. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution. The estimated expenses payable by Accelerize in connection with the offering of the securities being registered are as follows: SEC Registration and Filing Fee $ 555.77 Legal Fees and Expenses* $ 20,000.00 Accounting Fees and Expenses* $ 20,000.00 Financial Printing* $ 1,500.00 Transfer Agent Fees* $ 1,500.00 Miscellaneous* $ 1,000.00 TOTAL $ 44,555.77 * Estimated Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws provide that we are authorized to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). Section 145 of the DGCL permits a corporation, under specified circumstances, to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any action, suit or proceeding brought by third parties by reason of the fact that they were or are directors, officers, employees or agents of the corporation, if such directors, officers, employees or agents acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reason to believe their conduct was unlawful. In a derivative action, i.e., one by or in the right of the corporation, indemnification may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred by directors, officers, employees or agents in connection with the defense or settlement of any action or suit, and only with respect to a matter as to which they shall have acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made if such person shall have been adjudged liable to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that the defendant directors, officers, employees or agents are fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses despite such adjudication of liability. Our Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision which eliminates, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, director liability for monetary damages for breaches of the fiduciary duty of care or any other duty as a director. Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Following are all issuances of securities by the registrant during the past three years which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). In each of these issuances the recipient represented that he or it was acquiring the shares for investment purposes only, and not with a view towards distribution or resale except in compliance with applicable securities laws. No general solicitation or advertising was used in connection with any transaction, and the certificate evidencing the securities that were issued contained a legend restricting their transferability absent registration under the Securities Act or the availability of an applicable exemption therefrom. Unless specifically set forth below, no underwriter participated in the transaction and no commissions were paid in connection with the transactions. II-1 8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock On August 31, 2007, we completed an offering consisting of 118,875 shares of 8% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock resulting in gross proceeds to us of $4,160,625.

(b) Financial Statement Schedules. None Item 17. Undertakings The registrant undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which it offers or sales securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the registration statement; and notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) To include any additional or changed material information to the plan of distribution. II-4 (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: Each prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
