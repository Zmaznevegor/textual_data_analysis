SUMMARY INFORMATION, RISK FACTORS AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OUR COMPANY Global Green, Inc. (formerly Global Tech Assets, Inc.) ("We," "Us," "Our", "the Company") was initially incorporated on July 12, 2004, in the state of Florida, as a wholly-owned subsidiary, of Global Assets & Services, Inc., a public company. The Company was transferred all of the non-operating licenses held by Global Assets & Services, Inc. At that time, all of the outstanding stock of Global Tech Assets, Inc., 3,141,597 shares, was distributed to the shareholders of Global Assets and Services, Inc. In September of 2004, due to business reasons, management ceased operational activities to further develop the licenses. From that time to the present the business had no viable operations. The Company's name was changed to Global Green, Inc. on April 14, 2010 to reflect the new business model developed by management. On November 30, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Nutritional Health Institute Laboratories, LLC ("NHIL"), a Florida Limited Liability Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary Global Green International, Inc. ("Global Green International"), a Florida corporation. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, NHIL transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Global Green International (a total 600,000,000 shares, held solely by NHIL) to the Company in exchange for 683,097,847 shares of common stock of Global Green, Inc. After the exchange, NHIL held 92.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company and Global Green International became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. At May 31, 2011, NHIL holds 664,717,057 shares of common stock or 89.13% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. Our current Company business plan is focused on the agricultural animal industry, more specifically, "Salmogenics," a poultry salmonella vaccine. NHIL owns the exclusive rights to the Salmogenics Vaccine (hereinafter the "Vaccine") and a Salmonella Antigen (hereinafter the "Antigen") which both provide a method for controlling intestinal pathogenic organisms in animals. The Company has received the exclusive rights to finish the final phase of USDA study, manufacture, distribute, market and sell the vaccines by NHIL through a Licensing Agreement with GGII the wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Green, Inc. Under the Licensing Agreement with NHIL, the Company is responsible for all financial obligations to obtain United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") approval. The Company is in the process of having the Vaccine approved by the United States Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service ("USDA/FSIS"). The Company focuses on the commercialization of the salmonella vaccine for poultry industry markets. In 2008, NHIL obtained the ownership rights to the vaccine and took over the funding of a research study that had been in process since 1996, and initiated the drafting and filings of patent application for the vaccine. Research was being conducted through an unrelated third party, AHPharma, Inc. ("AHPharma."). AHPharma was informally engaged to conduct not only research and development, but also to perform the testing of the vaccine product in the poultry industry. Research focused on the development of the Salmogenics vaccine via in ovo injection delivery. At this time, the USDA has reviewed the results of the research which showed the vaccine used in the study is safe, non toxic and causes no harm to the animal, and reduced the number of salmonella contamination as required by USDA. The USDA has allowed the research to go to the final phase for approval by USDA for the Company to show efficacy of the vaccine in a commercial setting with large numbers of chickens and also to find a potential manufacturer for the vaccine. The Company has begun the final phase and AHPharma has begun collecting salmonella samples from multiple locations within the United States to start the mock study that was requested by USDA. The Company at the time of this filing has not entered into any agreement with a third party to manufacture the vaccine. The Company's product vaccine that is to be exclusively marketed under its licensing arrangement with NHIL is in the last stages of USDA required testing and depending upon the results of such testing may require additional research and development, testing and regulatory approval. The Company's development of its products will be subject to other risks of failure including, among others, the possibilities that any such products will be found to be ineffective or toxic, or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals; that any of the products, if safe and effective, will prove difficult or impossible to manufacture on a large scale or will be -3- uneconomical to market; that the proprietary rights of third parties will preclude the Company or its collaborators from marketing any products developed; that the products will fail to achieve market acceptance; and that third parties will market equivalent or superior products. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company or its collaborators will be able to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize the Company's product candidates within a reasonable time frame or ever. Failure to develop successfully the Company's current product candidates would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. We have no revenues at this time and anticipate that we will need additional capital to support the execution of our business plan. Decisions regarding future participation in acquisitions or other business development activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. We are in the developmental stage of our business, and we anticipate that operations will begin in late 2011. Our Auditors have issued a going concern opinion and the reasons noted for issuing the opinion are our lack of revenues and modest capital. Factors that make this offering highly speculative or risky are: o There is no market for any securities; o We have no revenues or sales; o We are a startup company; o We have no experience in the agricultural business as a company; o We are undercapitalized. Our executive offices are located at 2820 Remington Green Circle, Tallahassee, Florida 32308 and the telephone number is (850) 597-7906 and the facsimile number is (850) 942-6620. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- As at March 31, 2011 --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- Total Assets $235,148 --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- Current Liabilities $500 --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- Shareholders' Equity $234,648 --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- From July 12, 2004 to March 31, 2011 --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- Revenues $ - --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- Accumulated net loss at March 31, 2011 ($58,383) --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- As of December 31, 2010, accumulated deficit for our business was ($5,728). At March 31, 2011, accumulated deficit was ($58,383). We anticipate that we will operate in a deficit position and continue to sustain net losses for the foreseeable future. THE OFFERING We are registering 147,516,080 shares listed for sale on behalf of selling shareholders. As we are registering shares on behalf of our existing shareholders, we will not receive funds from the sale of any shares that are sold by the selling shareholders. ============================================================= ================ Common shares Outstanding Before This Offering 745,761,432 ------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------- Maximum common shares being offered by selling shareholders 147,516,080 ============================================================= ================ -4- We are authorized to issue 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock. Our current shareholders, officers and directors collectively own 745,761,432 shares of restricted common stock as of May 31, 2011. There is currently no public market for our shares as it is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange. OUR COMPANY RISK FACTORS OUR SECURITIES, AS OFFERED HEREBY, ARE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND SHOULD BE PURCHASED ONLY BY PERSONS WHO CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN US. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, AS WELL AS ALL OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS, BEFORE PURCHASING ANY OF THE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR BUSINESS IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND UNPROVEN AND THEREFORE RISKY. We have only very recently adopted the business plan described herein-above. Potential investors should be made aware of the risk and difficulties encountered by a new enterprise in the vaccine business, especially in view of the intense competition from existing businesses in the industry. WE HAVE A LACK OF REVENUE HISTORY AND INVESTORS CANNOT VIEW OUR PAST PERFORMANCE SINCE WE ARE A START-UP COMPANY. We were formed on July 12, 2004, for the purpose of engaging in any lawful business and have adopted a plan to focus on the agriculture industry, more specifically, "Salmogenics," a poultry salmonella vaccine. We have had no revenues in the last five years. We have only had operational activities during the last year. We are not profitable and the business effort is considered to be in an early development stage. We must be regarded as a new or development venture with all of the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, risks and difficulties to which such ventures are subject. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN OR INCREASE PROFITABILITY OR RAISE SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE. Future operating performance is never certain, and if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock will likely decline. We have a history of operating losses. We have not recognized revenues from the sale of our product, as we are still in the testing and trial stages. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis once we are able to begin marketing and sale of the vaccine. Moreover, we anticipate that our operating and capital expenditures will increase significantly in 2011 and in future years primarily due to: o additional spending to support the marketing and sales of vaccines; o working capital requirements for sales of vaccines; o growth in research and development expenses as we progress with the final phase development of our efficacy studies; o leasing of facilities and purchases of capital equipment; o investment in additional marketing capacity for our products and products in development. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow, or to raise sufficient capital, to fund these operating and capital expenditures depends on our ability to improve operating performance. This in turn depends, among other things, on finalizing our study and getting USDA approval and finding a partner to manufacture it and then successfully completing the product and finding a partner for marketing and sales first in USA and then worldwide. We may not successfully develop and commercialize these products. -5- IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. The success of our business depends, in large part, on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for personnel among companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business. WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS OR PROFITABILITY TO OUR INVESTORS. There is no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. There is no assurance that we will generate revenues or profits, or that the market price of our common stock will be increased thereby. WE MAY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. Our capital needs consist primarily of expenses related to final field testing of the vaccine for the USDA approval general and administrative and potential marketing expenses and could exceed $1,900,000 in the next twelve months. Such funds are not currently committed, and we have cash as of the date of this Registration Statement of approximately $200,000. We have no operating history and no revenues and it may be unlikely that we will raise that additional working capital from this Registration. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHICH MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FAVORABLY TO US. Certain conflicts of interest may exist between us and our officers and directors. Our Officers and Directors have other business interests to which they devote their attention and may be expected to continue to do so although management time should be devoted to our business. In addition, our officers and directors are officers, directors and employees of our majority shareholder, NHIL. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through exercise of such judgment as is consistent with fiduciary duties to us. Because shareholders will not be able to manage our business, they should critically assess all of the information concerning our officers and directors. See "Directors and Executive Officers" (page 43), and "Conflicts of Interest" (page 44). Our officers are spending part-time in this business - up to 30 hours per week. WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO COMMITMENTS, AND THIS MAY JEOPARDIZE EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. We have limited funds, and such funds may not be adequate to carryout the business plan in the animal vaccine industry. Our ultimate success depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. We have not investigated the availability, source, or terms that might govern the acquisition of additional capital and will not do so until it determines a need for additional financing. If we need additional capital, we have no assurance that funds will be available from any source or, if available, that they can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If not available, our operations will be limited to those that can be financed with our modest capital. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE ISSUE MORE SHARES WHICH COULD CAUSE A LOSS OF CONTROL BY OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. We may issue further shares as consideration for the cash or assets or services out of our authorized but unissued common stock that would, upon issuance, represent a majority of the voting power and equity of our Company. The result of such an issuance would be those new stockholders and management would control our Company, and persons unknown could replace our management at this time. Such an occurrence would result in a greatly reduced percentage of ownership of our Company by our current shareholders, which could present significant risks to investors. -6- WE HAVE A MINIMAL OPERATING HISTORY, SO INVESTORS HAVE NO WAY TO GAUGE OUR LONG TERM PERFORMANCE. We were formed on July 12, 2004, and only recently adopted a business plan in the vaccine industry. As evidenced by the financial reports, we have had no revenue. We must be regarded as a new or development venture with all of the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, and difficulties to which such ventures are subject. Our venture must be considered highly speculative. WE ARE NOT DIVERSIFIED AND WE WILL BE DEPENDENT ON ONLY ONE BUSINESS. Because of the limited financial resources that we have, it is unlikely that we will be able to diversify our operations. Our probable inability to diversify our activities into more than one area will subject us to economic fluctuations within the animal vaccine industry and therefore increase the risks associated with our operations due to lack of diversification. WE WILL DEPEND UPON MANAGEMENT BUT WE WILL HAVE LIMITED PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT. We currently have two individuals who are serving as our officers and directors for up to 30 hours per week combined, each on a part-time basis. Both directors, Dr. Ghazvini, DC and Dr. Reed, DC, are also acting as our officers. We will be heavily dependent upon their skills, talents, and abilities, as well as several consultants to us, to implement our business plan, and may, from time to time, find that the inability of the officers, directors and consultants to devote their full-time attention to our business results in a delay in progress toward implementing our business plan. Once we receive the proceeds from this offering, other officers and consultants may be employed on a part-time or full time basis under a contract to be determined. See "Management." Because investors will not be able to manage our business, they should critically assess all of the information concerning our officers and directors. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE NOT EMPLOYED FULL-TIME BY US WHICH COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE BUSINESS. Our directors and officers are owners of our majority shareholder, NHIL. In the future they may become, in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling shareholder and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, our officers and directors may have potential conflicts including their time and efforts involved in participation with other business entities. In some circumstances this conflict may arise between their fiduciary duties to us and their fiduciary duties to NHIL'S business divisions. It is possible that in this situation their judgment maybe more consistent with their fiduciary duties to these ventures and may be detrimental to our interests. Each officer and director of our business is engaged in business activities outside of our business, and the amount of time they devote as Officers and Directors to our business will be up to 30 hours per week. As such time as the Company is financially capable of paying salaries, it is anticipated that management will assume full time roles in the Company's operations. (See "Executive Team") We do not know of any reason other than outside business interests that would prevent them from devoting full-time to our Company, when the business may demand such full-time participation. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS AS TO CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN. Presently there is no requirement contained in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or minutes which requires officers and directors of our business to disclose to us business opportunities which come to their attention. Our officers and directors do, however, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to us to disclose to us any business opportunities which come to their attention, in their capacity as an officer and/or director or otherwise. Excluded from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and director of another company. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring business opportunity from any affiliate or officer or director. (See "Conflicts of Interest" at page 44) In addition, our officers and directors are officers, directors and employees of our majority shareholder, NHIL. Our Officers and Directors may be expected to continue to devote time to these ventures although management time should be -7- devoted to our business. As a result, in some circumstances a conflict may arise between their fiduciary duties to us and their fiduciary duties to NHIL. It is possible that in this situation their judgment maybe more consistent with their fiduciary duties to these ventures and may be detrimental to our interests. RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS IF WE ARE UNABLE SELL THE VACCINE, OUR REVENUES FROM THE VACCINE WILL BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE. Because we depend, and expect to continue to depend, on sales of a single vaccine product for a substantial majority of our revenues, decreased or lower-than-anticipated demand for the vaccine, or our inability to meet demand, could materially adversely affect our operating results and harm our business. Because we have not begun marketing vaccines, long-term effects of the vaccine are largely unknown. Adverse developments regarding the long-term safety and efficacy of the vaccines could adversely affect demand for the product, or restrict our ability to market and sell it for its current or potential indications. Other factors that would adversely affect sales of the vaccine include: o competition from existing products or development of new, superior products; o our ability to maintain adequate and uninterrupted sources of supply to meet demand; o events adversely affecting the ability of our manufacturing partners to produce the vaccines; o contamination of product lots or product recalls; and o our inability to gain regulatory approval to market the vaccine. OUR FINAL SAFETY FIELD TRIALS OF POTENTIAL PRODUCTS COULD BE UNSUCCESSFUL, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINAL USDA APPROVAL. Before obtaining final USDA approvals for the sale of any of our potential product, we must subject these products to a regulatory safety field trial to demonstrate the vaccine's effectiveness when applied on a large scale basis. If the final phase is unsuccessful, we will be unable to commercialize new products and, as a result, we may be unable to sustain the Company's growth or potential profitability. Results of initial efficacy are not necessarily indicative of results to be obtained from later efficacy studies and, as a result, we may suffer significant setbacks in advanced efficacy studies. We may not complete our clinical trials of products and the results of the trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of new products to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESSES AND ONGOING REGULATION, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING AND SUBJECT US TO UNANTICIPATED DELAYS OR LOST SALES. The USDA imposes substantial requirements on our products before it permits us to manufacture, market and sell them to the public or producer of poultry. Compliance with these requirements is costly and time-consuming, and could delay sales of products. To meet USDA requirements, we have spent and will continue to spend substantial resources on lengthy and detailed laboratory tests and efficacy studies. It typically takes many years to complete tests and trials for a product. The actual length of time involved depends on the type, complexity and novelty of the product. The USDA may not approve on a timely basis, if at all, some or all of our future products or may not approve some or all of our applications for additional indications for our previously approved products. If we violate regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after marketing approval is obtained, we may be fined or forced to remove a product from the market or may experience other adverse consequences, including delay or increased costs, which could materially harm our financial results. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain approval for the labeling claims necessary or desirable for promoting our products. Even if approval is obtained, we may be required or may elect to undertake post-marketing trials. -8- WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL TRIALS OR CHANGE THE LABELING OF OUR PRODUCTS IF WE OR OTHERS IDENTIFY SIDE EFFECTS AFTER OUR PRODUCTS ARE ON THE MARKET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional efficacy studies, additional changes in labeling of our products and changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required, any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. OUR ABILITY TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP OR COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR RESEARCH AND MARKETING COLLABORATIONS ARE TERMINATED. We have relationships with collaborators who conduct research at our request. Some of our collaborators also have shared marketing rights to products subject to the collaboration. These collaborators are not our employees. As a result, we have limited control over their activities and, except as otherwise required by our collaboration agreements, can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities. Our ability to discover, develop and commercialize products will depend in part on the continuation of these collaborations. If any of these collaborations are terminated, we may not be able to enter into other acceptable collaborations. In addition, our existing collaborations may not be successful. Disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters, including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights. These disputes may be both costly and time-consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of products. THERE ARE OTHER PRODUCTS IN LATE-STAGE DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE TARGETING SALMONELLA. DEPENDING ON THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS OR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS, OUR SALES OF THE VACCINE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. A number of our competitors have substantially more capital, research and development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, human and other resources and experience than we have. Furthermore, large pharmaceutical companies recently have been consolidating, which has increased their resources and concentrated valuable intellectual property assets. As a result, our competitors may: o develop products that are more effective or less costly than any of our current or future products or that render our products obsolete; o produce and market their products more successfully than we do; o establish superior proprietary positions; or o obtain USDA approval for labeling claims that are more favorable than those for our products. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DEFEND LAWSUITS OR PAY DAMAGES FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS. Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We could face substantial product liability and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management's attention or adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our product. We do not maintain product liability insurance coverage. In the future, insurers may not offer us product liability insurance, may raise the price of this insurance or may limit the coverage. OUR FUTURE GROWTH DEPENDS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CURRENT VACCINE PRODUCT. There is no guarantee that our products will be successfully developed and marketed. In addition, we have not cleared the regulatory approval process for our product, and we cannot assure you that final regulatory approval will be obtained. Any delay in our final development of these products may materially adversely affect our revenue growth. Because of a number of factors, our product may not reach the market without lengthy delays, if at all. Some of the factors that may affect our development and marketing of new products include the following: -9- o potential products may require collaborative partners and we may be unable to identify partners or enter into arrangements on terms acceptable to us; o we may not be able to produce or contract for the manufacture of new products at a cost or in quality or quantities necessary to make them commercially viable; o domestic and international regulatory approval of these products may not be obtained or may be obtained only with lengthy delays; o we may not be able to secure additional financing that may be needed to bring a potential product to market; o we may experience unexpected safety, regulatory or efficacy concerns with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to adverse public reaction, product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales; and o we may be unable to accurately predict market requirements and evolving standards. WE FACE RISKS OF COMPETITION AND CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. The poultry vaccine business is especially competitive and dominated by a few large companies with an established global presence. In order for us to expand our sales of the vaccine, these products must be commercially accepted worldwide and compete effectively against the vaccines of these other companies. Our inability to compete successfully in the poultry vaccine sector could materially adversely affect our revenue growth. Our competitors and potential competitors include independent companies that specialize in biotechnology, as well as major agricultural or animal health companies, pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies, universities and public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors are well established and have substantially greater marketing, financial, technological and other resources than we have. Competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that have been or are being developed by us or that could render our technology and products obsolete or non-competitive. IF NHIL LOSES THE PROTECTION OF ITS PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD SUFFER. Importance and Limitations of Patent and Proprietary Rights Protections Some of our products and processes used to produce our products involve proprietary rights, including patents, which are held by our parent NHIL. Our competitors or potential competitors may have filed for or received United States and foreign patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to animal vaccines uses and/or processes which may compete with our existing products and our products under development. We cannot be sure that others will not obtain patents of different technology that we would need to license or circumvent in order to practice our inventions. Even though we strive to take appropriate action to protect our intellectual property, there is a risk that competitive systems currently being developed and marketed could gain acceptance in the United States or elsewhere. We and NHIL believe that patent protection of materials or processes we develop and any products that may result from the research and development efforts of our licensors and us are important to the commercial success of our products. The loss of the protection of these patents and proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business and our competitive position in the market. The patent position of companies such as ours generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Some of the reasons for this uncertainty include the following: o To date, no consistent regulatory policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Consequently, there can be no assurance that future patent applications relating to our products or technology will result in patents being issued or -10- that, if issued, the patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology; o Some patent licenses held by us may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events or become non-exclusive after a specified period; o Companies that obtain patents claiming products or processes that are necessary for or useful to the development of our vaccine could bring legal actions against us claiming infringement (though we currently are not the subject of any patent infringement claim); o Issuance of a valid patent does not prevent other companies from using alternative, non-infringing technology, so we cannot be sure that any of our patents (or patents issued to others and licensed to us) will provide significant commercial protection; o We may not have the financial resources necessary to obtain patent protection in some countries or to enforce any patent rights we may hold; o The laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries; and o We may be required to obtain licenses from others to develop, manufacture or market our products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and we cannot be sure that the patents underlying the licenses will be valid and enforceable. We and NHIL attempt to protect our proprietary materials and processes by relying on trade secret laws and non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees and other persons with access to our proprietary materials or processes or who have licensing or research arrangements with us. We plan to continue to use these protections in the future, but we cannot be sure that these agreements will not be breached or that we would have adequate remedies for any breach. Even with these protections, others may independently develop or obtain access to these materials or processes, which may materially adversely affect our competitive position. If we are sued for infringing the patent or other proprietary rights of a third party, we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel, whether or not the litigation is ultimately determined in our favor. GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RELIANCE ON CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS We currently do not have facilities for the production of our vaccine products. Therefore, we rely principally upon relationships with contract manufacturers. There can be no assurance that we can maintain manufacture and supply agreements on terms and at costs acceptable to us. We have various relationships with manufacturers and suppliers, including those described below. The loss of any of these relationships could materially adversely affect our operating results. There are a number of risks associated with our dependence on contract manufacturers, including: o reduced control over delivery schedules; o potential inability to monitor and maintain inventory levels; o reduced control over quality assurance; o reduced control over manufacturing yields and costs; o potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of unanticipated demand; o limited warranties on products supplied to us; -11- o increases in prices at a higher rate than our ability to recover our increased costs through contractual price adjustments with customers; o reduced control over regulatory efforts; o potential misappropriation of our intellectual property; o catastrophic loss of production capacity due to property damage, either man made or by nature; o the loss of these contract manufacturers due to financial circumstances in their respective businesses or their exit from the business lines that manufacture our devices and products; and o minimum purchase requirements, which could result in excessive inventories if the demand for products falls short of such minimum purchase requirements. If our contract manufacturers failed to provide us with an adequate supply of vaccine products, our business would be harmed. We do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with any of our vendors that guarantee product availability or the continuation of particular payment terms. In addition, we are currently dependent on a single contract manufacturer for several of our key products as described below. Although we believe our relationship with each of the manufacturers is sound, we cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain relationships with them or that they will continue to exist. POULTRY HEALTH AND DISEASE FACTORS AFFECTING OUR CUSTOMERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. Any widespread poultry health problem or disease outbreak, such as avian influenza in poultry, could have a negative impact on global poultry production. Our revenues and earnings derived from both the U.S. and international poultry industry could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the emergence of new disease variants, serotypes and strains in the domestic and/or global markets may reduce the efficacy of our vaccine products and result in reduced revenues and earnings. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. Our future success depends on our ability to attract qualified independent distributors for the vaccine products. We may be unable to attract or retain these independent distributors. If we fail to attract or retain independent distributors, or if our existing independent distributors fail to find end users for the vaccine products, we may be unable to successfully bring the vaccine products to the marketplace and to generate sufficient revenues to offset operating costs. WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS IS PROVIDED BY FLORIDA STATUTE. Florida Statutes provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against attorney's fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or on activities our behalf. We will also bear the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents, upon such person's promise to repay us therefore if it is ultimately determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures by us that we will be unable to recoup. WE RELY ON DR. MEHRAN P. GHAZVINI, DC, OUR PRESIDENT, AND DR. RENE M. REED, DC, OUR VICE PRESIDENT, WHO DO NOT DEVOTE THEIR FULL BUSINESS TIME TO OUR BUSINESS. We rely principally on Dr. Ghazvini and Dr. Reed for their entrepreneurial skills and experience to implement our business plan. Presently Drs. Ghazvini and Reed do not devote their full time and attention to our affairs which could result in delays in implementing our business plan. Our success depends to a critical extent on the continued efforts of services of our President and Vice President. -12- If we were to lose Drs. Ghazvini and Reed, we would be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of a replacement, which would result in both a delay in the implementation of our business plan and the diversion of limited working capital. We can give you no assurance that we can find satisfactory replacements for these key executive officers at all, or on terms that are not unduly expensive or burdensome to our company. We do not currently carry a key-man life insurance policy on Dr. Mehran P. Ghazvini, DC and Dr. Rene M. Reed, DC, which would assist us in recouping our costs in the event of the loss of either of these officers. Moreover, we do not have an employment agreement with any of our directors or officers including Drs. Ghazvini and Reed. Accordingly, if Drs. Ghazvini and Reed do not continue to manage our affairs, or devote sufficient amounts of their business time to enable us to implement our business plan, our business would likely fail and you may lose your entire investment. TWO OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. AS SUCH THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF THEM CONTROLLING THE COMPANY TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUTSIDERS. Together, Dr. Mehran P. Ghazvini, DC and Dr. Rene M. Reed, DC, through direct and indirect ownership, are majority shareholders of Nutritional Health Institute Laboratories ("NHIL"), the majority shareholder of our Company. As such, they will be able to control the operations and the direction of the Company with very little outside influence. Drs. Ghazvini and Reed do not hold direct shares of common stock of the Company. However, they are officers, directors and beneficial shareholders of Nutritional Health Institute Laboratories and have the ability to vote the shares of NHIL, our majority shareholder. o Dr. Mehran P. Ghazvini, DC owns approximately 50% of NHIL, indirectly through family trusts and has the power to vote those interests on behalf of the trusts and disavows any ownership in the equity of NHIL held by family trusts; and o Dr. Rene M. Reed, DC owns approximately 16.66% of NHIL, indirectly through family trusts and has the power to vote those interests on behalf of the trusts and disavows any ownership in the equity of NHIL held by family trusts As such, they are the beneficial holders of the 664,717,057 shares held by NHIL. Through their ownership in NHIL, Drs. Ghazvini and Reed as a group, control approximately 664,717,057 shares of common stock or approximately 89.13% of the voting stock of the Company. WE MAY DEPEND UPON OUTSIDE ADVISORS, WHO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE TERMS AND AS NEEDED. To supplement the business experience of our officers and directors, we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, or other consultants or advisors. Our Board without any input from stockholders will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore, we anticipate that such persons will be engaged on an "as needed" basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us. In the event we consider it necessary to hire outside advisors, we may elect to hire persons who are affiliates, if they are able to provide the required services. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR STOCK BECAUSE DR. MEHRAN P. GHAZVINI,DC, OUR PRESIDENT, CEO, CFO, SECRETARY/TREASURER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND DR. RENE M. REED, DC, VICE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR CONTROL APPROXIMATELY 89.13% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, THEY WILL CONTROL AND MAKE CORPORATE DECISIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS WILL HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO AFFECT CORPORATE DECISIONS. Dr. Ghazvini and Dr. Reed, control approximately 89.13% of the outstanding shares of our common stock beneficially through Nutritional Health Institute Laboratories, our majority shareholder. This beneficial ownership gives them almost complete influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions and business decisions. The interests of Drs. Ghazvini and Reed may differ from the interests of the other stockholders, and since they have the ability to control most decisions through their control of our common stock, our shareholders will have limited ability to affect decisions made by management. -13- THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF OUR SECURITIES. We are a "penny stock" company. None of our securities currently trade in any market and, if ever available for trading, will be subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers or accredited investors. For purposes of the rule, the phrase "accredited investors" means, in general terms, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or having an annual income that exceeds $200,000 (or that, when combined with a spouse's income, exceeds $300,000). For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Effectively, this discourages broker-dealers from executing trades in penny stocks. Consequently, the rule will affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell their securities in any market that might develop therefore because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate "penny stocks". Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities constitute "penny stocks" within the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and to our securities. The rules will further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions. Shareholders should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) "boiler room" practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. WE WILL PAY NO FORESEEABLE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not ever anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. NO PUBLIC MARKET EXISTS FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AT THIS TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF A FUTURE MARKET. There is no public market for our common stock, and no assurance can be given that a market will develop or that a shareholder ever will be able to liquidate his investment without considerable delay, if at all. If a market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Factors such as those discussed in the "Risk Factors" section may have a significant impact upon the market price of the shares offered hereby. Due to the low price of our securities, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in our securities. Even if a purchaser finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in our shares, the combination of brokerage commissions, state transfer taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of our shares as collateral for any loans. OUR STOCK WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE THINLY TRADED AND AS A RESULT YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL AT OR NEAR ASK PRICES OR AT ALL IF YOU NEED TO LIQUIDATE YOUR SHARES. The shares of our common stock, if listed, may be thinly-traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment -14- community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven, early stage company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of any of our Securities until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our Securities is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on Securities price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common Securities will develop or be sustained, or that any trading levels will be sustained. Due to these conditions, we can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell their shares at or near ask prices or at all if they need money or otherwise desire to liquidate their securities of our Company. OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE RISK THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SECURITIES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE THAT YOU MAY PAY FOR THE SECURITY. Because of the limited trading market expected to develop for our common stock and because of the possible price volatility, you may not be able to sell your shares of common stock when you desire to do so. The inability to sell your securities in a rapidly declining market may substantially increase your risk of loss because of such illiquidity and because the price for our securities may suffer greater declines because of our price volatility. The price of our common stock that will prevail in the market after this offering may be higher or lower than the price you may pay. Certain factors, some of which are beyond our control, that may cause our share price to fluctuate significantly include, but are not limited to the following: o Variations in our quarterly operating results; o Loss of a key relationship or failure to complete significant transactions; o Additions or departures of key personnel; and o Fluctuations in stock market price and volume. Additionally, in recent years the stock market in general, and the over-the-counter markets in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In some cases, these fluctuations are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the underlying company. These market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of those companies common stock. If we become involved in this type of litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could have a further negative effect on your investment in our stock. MANY OF OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WILL IN THE FUTURE BE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE. ANY SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, IF IN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS, ARE LIKELY TO DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES. Assuming all of the shares of common stock we are offering under this Registration Statement are sold and all of the shares of common stock held by the selling security holders registered hereby are sold, we would have 147,516,080 shares that are freely tradable. Our officers and directors are registering their shares for sale under this prospectus. Unrestricted sales of 147,516,080 shares of stock by our selling stockholders could have a huge negative impact on our share price, and the market for our shares. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND THE INVESTMENT IS THEREFORE RISKY. Due to the speculative nature of our business, it is probable that the investment in shares offered hereby will result in a total loss to the investor. Investors should be able to financially bear the loss of their entire investment. Investment should, therefore, be limited to that portion of discretionary funds not needed for normal living purposes or for reserves for disability and retirement. -15- WE WILL BECOME A REPORTING COMPANY UPON THE FILING OF THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT, BUT OUR STOCK IS NOT PUBLICLY TRADED. There is no trading market for our common stock. We will be subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, Section 13a, after the effectiveness of this offering, pursuant to Section 15d of the Securities Act and we intend to be registered under Section 12(g). As a result, shareholders will have access to the information required to be reported by publicly held companies under the Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. We intend to provide our shareholders with quarterly unaudited reports and annual reports containing financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles audited by independent certified public accountants and intend to register under the Securities Exchange Act, Section 12(g). WE HAVE DETERMINED AN ARBITRARY OFFERING PRICE OF OUR SHARES. The price of our shares has been determined arbitrarily by us with no established criteria of value. There is no direct relationship between these prices and our assets, book value, lack of earnings, shareholder's equity, or any other recognized standard of value of our business. ITEM 4. USE OF PROCEEDS ----------------------- We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares being registered on behalf of our selling shareholders. At a time when market conditions have improved, we may raise additional funds through a private placement of shares of our common stock. At this time there is no committed source for such funds and we cannot give any assurances of being able to raise such funds. We can assure that we will require additional funds to carry out our business plan. The availability and terms of any future financing will depend on market and other conditions. Our lack of funds could and would severely limit our operations, and might render us unable to carry out our business plan with resulting business failure. ITEM 5. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE --------------------------------------- We have no established market for our common stock. Our selling shareholders plan to sell shares at $0.25 per share, until such time as a market develops for any of the securities and thereafter at such prices as the market may dictate from time to time. There is no market price for the stock and our pricing is arbitrary with no relation to market value, liquidation value, earnings or dividends. --------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------- TITLE PER SECURITY --------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------- Common Stock $0.25 --------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------- We have arbitrarily determined our offering price for shares to be sold pursuant to this offering at $0.25. The Company is authorized to issue 3,000,000,000 shares of $0.00001 par value voting common stock. There were a total of 731,372,217 shares of common stock issued during the year ended December 31, 2010. Of which, 20,000,000 shares were issued at $0.00001 per share (par value) as compensation to existing shareholders for their services. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, the Company sold 11,247,618 shares of common stock as part of a private placement at approximately $0.025 per share. The additional major factors that were included in determining the initial sales price to our founders and private investors were the lack of liquidity since there was no present market for our stock and the high level of risk considering our lack of operating history. -16- The share price bears no relationship to any criteria of goodwill value, asset value, market price or any other measure of value and were arbitrarily determined in the judgment of our Board of Directors. ITEM 6. DILUTION ---------------- We are registering 147,516,080 shares of our outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2011. Since our inception on July 12, 2004, our original officers and directors were issued 3,141,597 shares at $0.0001 (par value) per share. A total of 28,274,370 shares were issued to existing shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2010 as part of a 10 for 1 forward stock split. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, 683,097,847 shares of common stock were issued at $0.00001, par value as part of the acquisition of Global Green International, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2010, 20,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to existing shareholders for services at $0.00001 par value. COMPARATIVE DATA The following table sets forth with respect to existing shareholders and new investors, a comparison of the number of our shares of common stock purchased the percentage ownership of such shares, the total consideration paid, the percentage of total consideration paid and the average price per share. All percentages are computed based upon cumulative shares and consideration assuming sale of all shares in the line item as compared to maximum in each previous line. SHARES PURCHASED TOTAL CONSIDERATION ---------------------- ------------------- AVERAGE NUMBER PERCENT AMOUNT PERCENT (3) PRICE/SHARE (2) ---------------------- ------------------- ----------- Existing Shareholders 147,516,080 100% 1,275 100% $0.00001 -------------------- (1) Percentage relates to total percentage of shares sold up to such increment in the offering. (2) Percentage relates to total percentage of capital raised post offering. "Net tangible book value" is the amount that results from subtracting the total liabilities and intangible assets from the total assets of an entity. Dilution occurs because we determined the offering price based on factors other than those used in computing book value of our stock. Dilution exists because the book value of shares held by existing stockholders is lower than the offering price offered to new investors. As at December 31, 2010, the net tangible book value of our stock was less than ($0.001) per share and at December 31, 2009 was $0 per share. As at March 31, 2011, the net tangible book value of our stock was $0.0003 per share. ITEM 7. SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS -------------------------------- Some of the selling shareholders obtained their shares of our stock as compensation for services and as a part of the 10 for 1 forward stock split. Most of the selling shareholders obtained there shares as a part of a private offering during the three months ended March 31, 2011. Our majority shareholder, NHIL received their 683,097,847 shares as part of the Share Exchange Agreement with the Company. We are authorized to issue 3,000,000,000 shares of $.00001 voting common stock. There were a total of 731,372,217 shares of common stock issued during the year ended December 31, 2010 and, therefore, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 there were a total of 734,513,814 and 3,141,597 shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At March 31, 2011 there are a total of 745,761,432 shares are issued and outstanding. These additional shares were comprised of 11,247,618 shares sold as part of a private placement at $0.025 per share. Other than the stock transactions discussed above, we have not entered into any transaction nor are there any proposed transactions in which any founder, director, executive officer, significant shareholder of our Company or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing had or is to have a direct or indirect material interest. -17- No person who may, in the future, be considered a promoter of this offering, will receive or expect to receive assets, services or other considerations from us except those persons who are our salaried employees or directors. No assets will be, nor expected to be, acquired from any promoter on behalf of us. We have not entered into any agreements that require disclosure to the shareholders. All of the securities listed below are being registered in this Registration Statement. ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- SHARE COMMON SHARES PERCENTAGE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP OFFERED FOR OWNERSHIP OWNERSHIP REGISTERED HOLDER'S NAME BEFORE SHAREHOLDERS BEFORE AFTER (BENEFICIAL OWNER'S NAME) OFFERING ACCOUNT OFFERING OFFERING ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- THE 2003 ABBEY FLP LTD 6,071,429 6,071,429 0.81% 0.81% ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- ALBERT AKULONIS 20,960 20,960 0.00% 0.00% ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- JOHN ALLEN 16,800 16,800 0.00% 0.00% ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- RYAN ALLEN 10 10 0.00% 0.00% ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- ALPINE REAL PROPERTY EQUITY GROUP, INC. 4,650 4,650 0.00% 0.00% ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- MITSUNOBU AMAZAKI 300,000 300,000 0.04% 0.04% ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- BARBARANNE ANDERSEN 10 10 0.00% 0.00% ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- MARK ARGO 14 14 0.00% 0.00% ------------------------------------------ -- --------------- -- ------------------- -- -------------- --- ------------- ROBERT L.

ITEM 11. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE REGISTRANT --------------------------------------------------- A. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS ------------------------ HISTORY OF GLOBAL GREEN, INC. Global Green, Inc. (formerly Global Tech Assets, Inc.) ("We," "Us," "Our", "the Company") was initially incorporated on July 12, 2004, in the state of Florida, as a wholly-owned subsidiary, of Global Assets & Services, Inc., a public company. The Company was transferred all of the non-operating licenses held by Global Assets & Services, Inc. At that time, all of the outstanding stock of Global Tech Assets, Inc., 3,141,597 shares, was distributed to the shareholders of Global Assets and Services, Inc. In September of 2004, due to business reasons, management ceased operational activities to further develop the licenses. From that time to the present the business had no viable operations. The Company's name was changed to Global Green, Inc. on April 14, 2010 to reflect the new business model developed by management. On November 30, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Nutritional Health -26- Institute Laboratories, LLC ("NHIL"), a Florida Limited Liability Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary Global Green International, Inc. ("Global Green International"), a Florida corporation. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, NHIL transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Global Green International (a total 600,000,000 shares, held solely by NHIL) to the Company in exchange for 683,097,847 shares of common stock of Global Green, Inc. After the exchange, NHIL held 92.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company and Global Green International became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. At May 31, 2011, NHIL holds 664,717,057 shares of common stock or 89.13% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. Our current business plan is focused on the agricultural animal industry, more specifically, "Salmogenics," a poultry salmonella vaccine. NHIL owns the exclusive rights to the Salmogenics Vaccine (hereinafter the "Vaccine") and a Salmonella Antigen (hereinafter the "Antigen") which both provide a method for controlling intestinal pathogenic organisms in animals. The Company has received the exclusive rights to finish the final phase of study, manufacture, distribute, market and sell the vaccines by NHIL through a Licensing Agreement with Global Green International, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the Licensing Agreement with NHIL, the Company is responsible for all financial obligations to obtain United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") approval. The Company is in the process of having the Vaccine and Antigen approved by the United States Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service ("USDA/FSIS"). The Company focuses on the commercialization of the salmonella vaccine for poultry industry markets. In 2008, NHIL obtained the ownership rights to the vaccine and took over the funding of a research study that had been in process since 1996, and initiated the drafting and filings of patent application for the vaccine. Research was being conducted through an unrelated third party, AHPharma. AHPharma was informally engaged to conduct not only research and development, but also to perform the testing of the vaccine product in the poultry industry. At this time, the USDA has reviewed the results of the research which showed the vaccine used in the study is safe, non toxic and causes no harm to the animal, and reduced the number of salmonella contamination and therefore has allowed the research to go to the final phase for approval by USDA for the Company to show efficacy of the vaccine in a commercial setting with large numbers of chickens and also to find a potential manufacturer for the vaccine. The Company has begun the final phase and AHPharma has begun collecting salmonella samples from multiple locations within the United States to start the mock study that was requested by USDA. The Company at the time of this filing has not entered into any agreement with a third party to manufacture the vaccine. The Company's product vaccine that is to be exclusively marketed under its licensing arrangement with NHIL is in the last stages of USDA required testing and depending upon the results of such testing may require additional research and development, testing and regulatory approval. The Company's development of its products will be subject to other risks of failure including, among others, the possibilities that any such products will be found to be ineffective or toxic, or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals; that any of the products, if safe and effective, will prove difficult or impossible to manufacture on a large scale or will be uneconomical to market; that the proprietary rights of third parties will preclude the Company or its collaborators from marketing any products developed; that the products will fail to achieve market acceptance; and that third parties will market equivalent or superior products. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company or its collaborators will be able to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize the Company's product candidates within a reasonable time frame or ever. Failure to develop successfully the Company's current product candidates would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. We have no revenues at this time and anticipate that we will need additional capital to support the execution of our business plan. Decisions regarding future participation in acquisitions or other business development activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. The Company's product vaccine that is to be exclusively marketed under its licensing arrangement with NHIL are in the late developmental stage and may require additional research and development, testing and regulatory approval depending upon the results of final large scale testing. The Company's development of its product will be subject to other risks of failure including, -27- among others, the possibilities that any such products may fail to receive final and necessary regulatory approvals; that any of the products, if safe and effective, will prove difficult or impossible to manufacture on a large scale or will be uneconomical to market; that the products will fail to achieve market acceptance; and that third parties will market equivalent or superior products. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company or its collaborators will be able to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize the Company's product candidates within a reasonable time frame or ever. Failure to develop successfully the Company's current product candidate would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. COMPANY OVERVIEW We have been inactive during the last 5 years. We have no recent operating history and no representation is made, nor is any intended, that we will able to carry on our activities profitably. The viability of the proposed business effort is dependent upon sufficient funds being realized from this offering, of which there is no assurance. Our main emphasis will be to finish final phase of the study find a partner to manufacture the vaccine and get USDA approval We have no revenues at this time and anticipate that we will need additional capital to support the execution of our business plan. Decisions regarding future participation in acquisitions or other business development activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. We are a scientific research and development company of biologics products to domestic and international markets. Our background and expertise is in the research, testing, and development of vaccines for applications to animals to make the growing of these animals for human food sources both healthy for the animals, economical for the growers and most importantly our vaccine protect humans from diseases that are transmittable from animal food sources for adult and child safety. Our product, Salmogenics, is in the form of a vaccine that is injected in the egg, before it hatches, to give immunity to the Salmonella bacteria to the chick (Gallus domesticus -genus and species) Salmogenics is a multi-valent vaccine designed to protect against several strains of Salmonella bacteria and other opportunistic bacteria that frequently associate with Salmonella bacteria that further endangers the host's (chick's) survivability. The advantages of our vaccine when injected in ovo (into the fertilized egg) are: o While the animal health industry has developed a variety of treatments for the prevention of poultry diseases, these treatments are not always administered to the birds in ways that ensure effective and consistent results. o Conventional application has been post hatch (administered the 1st week after the chick is born, through feed and drinking water, via a spray that treats the birds through their mucus membranes or costly hand vaccinations. o Such treatments require multiple post-hatch vaccinations and field boosters, involving costly guesswork and are labor intensive. The result is inefficient, costly, inconsistent vaccine delivery. In ovo delivery of the vaccine overcomes problems that have arisen over the years when using water borne or spray vaccinations with chickens: o Many poultry caretakers and/or broiler farmers are involved o A variety of vaccination equipment is used on different farms o Re-use of containers with viable vaccine residues o Blocked spray nozzles o Incorrect spray pressure resulting in defective distribution patterns o Poor water quality (pH, minerals) o Use of hot water to reconstitute freeze dried vaccine pellets o Mixing heat and time sensitive vaccines for a complete day of vaccinations -28- o Incorrect dosage of vaccine for reconstitution o Incorrect dosage of diluent for dilution o Water lines contaminated with bacteria and/or carrying heavy biofilm loads o Too long or too short time within waterlines o Blocked needles or tubing o Defective vaccine reservoirs o Use of improperly handled diluents o Incorrect calibrated syringes o All of the above problems require added human interactions and added labor costs, as well as stress on the birds increasing mortality rates and negatively affecting "Food Conversion". The laboratory concept of `in the egg' vaccination was initially used for a Marek's disease (MD) vaccine and has been expanded into a commercially applied technology platform that is capable of placing several antigens and compounds simultaneously into over 50,000 eggs per hour. In ovo vaccination enables downstream process improvements in efficiencies such as high speed separation of chick and un-hatched eggs, rapid placement or reduced time from hatcher to farm, targeted precise therapeutic intervention and reduction of handling stress on the birds. In ovo vaccination offers many advantages over other treatments, such as: o Earlier immunity - an earlier exposure to various vaccines improves the bird health and disease resistance at the time when they are placed on the farm. o Uniform delivery - in ovo vaccination allows an automated and uniform process for delivering consistent volumes and concentrations of vaccines to every bird when compared to the previously used subcutaneous method of vaccination at day of hatch. The current cost can be as much as $.40-$.60 per chick to hand vaccinate. o Fast delivery - time is reduced from hatcher to farm with vaccinations after hatching being eliminated. o Reduced stress - birds are less stressed when vaccinated in ovo versus handling and injection after hatch. o Reduced labor costs - a reduction in the need for the labor associated with day of hatch subcutaneous vaccination is immediately realized. Compared to the day of hatch vaccination method there is a reduction in labor required to vaccinate the embryos. o Future products - new products and vaccines have recently been marketed and more are being developed that will effectively control diseases when applied in ovo. The manufacturing of our vaccine will be with seasoned pharmaceutical vaccine manufacturers. SALMOGENICS VACCINE Salmogenics stimulates an immune response in inoculated poultry to fight several intestinal pathogenic organism that include seven field strains of e. Coli, Psedomona aeruginosa, Aerobacter aerogenes, and four Salmonella strains. The chicken egg when properly vaccinated with Salmogenics hatches a Salmonella resistant chick that requires fewer antibiotics. Therefore humans consume higher quality meat grown with fewer antibiotics. HOW SALMOGENICS WILL POSITIVELY EFFECT LIVES Management estimates that 40 billion chickens will benefit form the Salmogenics Vaccine. Approximately, 1.3 billion humans get some form of Salmonella infection per year, based upon industry statistics. The Salmogenics vaccine improves the immune system of the fowl, thereby improving the health and welfare of the bird and those that eat chicken, turkey and other fowl. The birds will be healthier and experience increased weight gain and reduced mortality, a benefit for the poultry industry worldwide and humans consuming chickens. This means not only a healthier chicken, but a healthy source of protein for humans to consume with much less fear that they will become infected by Salmonella bacteria and suffer long-term illness or a worst case scenario, death. -29- WHAT IS SALMONELLA? Salmonella is the scientific name for over 2,500 of types of bacteria. The types are known to cause disease in humans, animals, and birds (especially poultry) worldwide. The bacteria is widespread and found mainly in the intestines of birds, reptiles and mammals. People can acquire the bacteria via a variety of different foods of animal origin. The illness it causes is called SALMONELLOSIS. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF SALMONELLOSIS? The symptoms of Salmonellosis typically include fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. In persons with poor underlying health or weakened immune systems, Salmonella can invade the bloodstream and cause life-threatening infections. Symptoms usually appear 12-72 hours after the ingestion of food contaminated with Salmonella and the illness from Salmonella usually last 4-7 days; mild cases can usually recover, but it may be several months before your bowel habits are entirely normal. According to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") this common food-borne illness can do more than just give one diarrhea or a stomach ache, but can cause the following long-term problems that appear 1-3 weeks following infection: o Joint pain o painful urination o conjunctivitis o knee pain WHAT IS SALMOGENICS VACCINE? Salmogenics vaccine is a patented vaccine for Salmonella. Salmogenics stimulates an immune response in inoculated poultry to several intestinal pathogenic organisms that include various Salmonella strains and several wild strains of other frequent pathogenic bacteria. Salmogenics contains the Sotomayor Antigen, which has been patented by the Company. An antigen is a substance that, when introduced into a body, triggers the production of an antibody by the immune system, which will then kill or neutralize the antigen that is recognized as a foreign and potentially harmful invader. The Sotomayor Antigen pertains to a particular composition of multiple germs mainly of the Genus Salmonella in order to control intestinal pathogenic organisms in the chicken species. HOW SALMOGENICS WILL POSITIVELY EFFECT LIVES Approximately, 40 billion chickens a year will benefit from the Salmogenics vaccine The Salmogenics vaccine improves the immune system of the chick, thereby improving the health and welfare of the bird and those that consume chicken, turkey and other poultry. The birds are less susceptible to illness and experience increased weight gain and reduced mortality, a big plus for the poultry industry worldwide. This means not only a healthier chicken, but a healthier source of protein for humans to consume with much less fear infection by Salmonella bacteria. HOW SALMOGENICS DIFFERS FROM OTHER VACCINES ON THE MARKET o Some current vaccines may interfere with efficacy of other vaccines or medications administered simultaneously with and/or subsequent to vaccination. o Salmogenics can be administered alone or with other vaccines. This makes Salmogenics very cost effective for chicken growers who grow 40 billion chickens per year for worldwide consumption. -30- o Additionally, some antigens may interfere with or affect the accuracy of traditional test or screening tools used to detect active or prior infections. o Salmogenics does not affect the accuracy of diagnostic procedures and does not reduce the effectiveness of other vaccines. It can be administered alone or with other vaccines thereby reducing the cost of administration. o Other vaccines are administered orally or through nasal passages or by individual injection which requires man hours to handle the birds at a cost of $0.40-$0.60 per injection. The Salmogenics vaccine can be administered with other vaccines directly into the egg before the egg is hatched without additional handling costs and without human handling of the chick and stress to the live bird. Prior vaccines generally failed to provide a Salmonella-containing multivalent vaccine composition which is as effective as Salmogenics in inducing an immune response to at least one intestinal pathogenic organism. The USDA has recently ordered the poultry industry to reduce the percentage of Salmonella infected chicken allowed on the market from 10% to 5%. Salmogenics has been shown in efficacy studies to help accomplish these strict requirements set forth by the USDA. MARKETING STRATEGY AND SIZE The Company intends to market to the USA broiler young chicken and parental industry initially followed by commercial egg-type laying hen and egg markets. USDA/FSIS regulatory approval is required for each specie and label claim. USA young progeny broiler market consists of 8.64 billion processed annually in 2010 produced from approximately 40 million laying hens- both are considered viable profitable markets for new technology vaccine markets. Following initial market entry into the young broiler chicken and parental markets, the Company is responsible for all financial obligations as NHIL will proceed to obtaining federal regulatory approval and initiate marketing efforts into the commercial egg-type laying hen and egg markets (218 million at any one time in the United States. It is well recognized that the Salmonella organism, once it infects the laying hen, will continue to contaminate the egg as it tracks down the oviduct. Once the organism is present in the egg, almost a perfect nutrient environment will assure that those persons consuming an uncooked egg (a common practice in most parts of the world) will become infected. Weaker human immune systems (i.e., the very young and very elderly) have a greater chance of Salmonella infection. The international animal industry is approximately 4-times the size of the United States chicken industry. Single-organism Salmonella vaccines have been used extensively in the United Kingdom plus those markets outside the United Kingdom. The UK's regulatory agencies have strongly encouraged Salmonella vaccines of both animal progeny and their parents. PRODUCT CUSTOMER DECISIONS The immediate customers are the poultry farms, specifically in the chicken industry and in particular Poultry Company Veterinarians. Vaccine product use decisions are fairly straightforward in the United States due to a limited number of Poultry Company Veterinarians who will determine technology need/worth, safety, efficacy and bottom-line profitability of the vaccine. Each Veterinarian must persuade their top management and cost accountants by conducting company field studies and demonstrations of cost-effectiveness as to the reason to use the product. -31- TOP 10 BROILER CHICKEN COMPANIES Representing 73 % of the total chickens processed annually include: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Annually Annual Rank Broiler Chicken Company Processed (million)(1) R-T-C (2) (lbs.) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #1 Tyson Foods, Inc.........................1,944 .............8,372 #2 Pilgrim's Pride Corp.....................1,676..............6,578 #3 Perdue Farms, Inc..........................626..............2,787 #4 Sanderson Farms, Inc.......................405..............2,566 #5 Koch Foods, Inc............................494..............1,828 #6 Wayne Farms, LLC ..........................289..............1,807 #7 Mountaire Farms, Inc.......................263..............1,740 #8 House of Raeford Farms, Inc................198..............1,217 #9 Foster Farms, Inc..........................296..............1,037 #10 Peco Foods, Inc............................176................986 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 TOTAL .............................. 6,369 million.....28,920 million ANNUAL TOTAL ................................8.64 billion.......38.8 billion TOP 10 (% of total) ................................73.7 %.............74.5 % -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Number of birds that represents "MARKET SIZE" for the Company's product.

MARKET PENETRATION TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED United States markets will be penetrated with a market entry program that will include: o Research data publications, including efficacy and safety research. o Company and product name(s) recognition. o Strong and reliable regulatory approvals and label claim development. o Company presents at an imal meetings (particularly and initially poultry meetings and conventions). o Company and product advertising in prominent animal production (especially and initially the chicken production industry) and food safety publications. o A strong and well-experience technical staff that will work with the technical experts in the poultry industry, such staff has not been identified at the time of this filing. o Strong sales force, with experience in the poultry industry. COMPETITION, AREAS OF INTENDED USAGE, AND SUCCESS RATE Historically, vaccines have generally fail to provide a multivalent antigen (an antigen which stimulates production of multiple antibodies) composition which can be easily and effectively administered in a commercial farm environment at a reduced cost, while failing to provide a multivalent antigen composition that can be utilized alone or in combination with vaccine products for use with other diseases without reducing the efficacy of either vaccine component and/or the ability to detect or diagnose particular diseases within inoculated birds. Current vaccines competitive to the Company's include: o Sorulin(TM), with the active ingredients BACILLUS SUBTILIS and BACILLUS LICHENIFORMIS, is fed via animal feed additive with intended use in live performance general bacteria issues. Typically, this product is used in live broiler young chicken production operations. The product has been introduced with very limited success. o FloraMax-B11(TM) that is a probiotic for poultry only and administered as a water soluble additive with intended use in SALMONELLA and E. COLI food safety issues. Typically this product is used in commercial -32- egg-type and breeder hen production operations. The product has had some success in commercial egg-type laying hen operations. o LAYERMUNE(R) SE currently sets the standard in SALMONELLA ENTERITIDIS protection of commercial egg-type laying hens in the USA. CEVA, a French pharmaceutical company, received the first USDA license for a poultry vaccine against S. enteritidis with multiple strains aids for the reduction of salmonella colonization of the intestinal tract thereby reducing the risk of SE shed in the environment and egg shell contamination. Introduced in 1992, LAYERMUNE(R) SE has been instrumental in earning CEVA the #1 ranking in salmonella vaccines in the U.S. The oil-based bacteria product is administered to chickens via subcutaneous injections. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The Company has successfully completed the requirements of Phase I, Phase II and Phase III efficacy studies as set forth by the USDA and the Salmogenics product has currently entered into the final phase of becoming a USDA approved vaccine for the in ovo vaccination of chicken eggs. On January 28, 2011, strains of Salmogenics Vaccine were deposited with the American Type Culture Collection Repository. The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) is a private, not-for-profit biological resource center whose mission focuses on the acquisition, authentication, production, preservation, development and distribution of standard reference microorganisms, cell lines and other materials for research in the life sciences. The deposit was made in order to have ATCC determine whether the Salmogenics vaccines meet industry standards. On February 15, 2011, with USDA approval, AHPharma began the final phase of Salmogenics vaccine consisting of in house study ordered and required by USDA for the chicken industry. The Company completed all prior requirements of the USDA to include: 1. Phase I which involved independent research with Dr. James McNaughton, PhD and AHPharma, Inc. which demonstrated that Salmogenics Vaccine: o Reduced fecal bacteria loads significantly for E coli and Salmonella bacteria. o Produced an average weight gain of 2% per bird. o Reduced mortality. 2. Phase II demonstrated: o In this phase various dosages of Salmogenic were tested to determine the most efficient and cost effective amount of vaccine to be administered to produce a chicken born with less or no Salmonella bacteria. o Clinical testing also showed that eggs treated with Salmogenics Vaccine had a reduced mortality as compared to the control groups. 3. Phase III involved proving that Salmogenics vaccine: o When tested clinically Salmogenics Vaccine showed to help reduce the incidence of Salmonella and reach a point that meets the USDA regulatory requirements. o As of August 13, 2010 the USDA issued an edict that the acceptable incidence of Salmonella for chicken growers had been reduced from 7% to a 5% tolerance. Additionally, Salmogenics vaccine was concomitantly administered with Mareks vaccine and found to not alter the effects of Mareks Vaccine nor the effectiveness of Salmogenics Vaccine. 4. As of February 16, 2011, the Company was able to announce that the final phase of USDA approval had begun, which will involve: a. Meeting with the USDA for a review of the final steps. b. Selecting a vaccine manufacturer. c. The collection of salmonella strains for the mock study requested by USDA. -33- d. The approval of AHPharma by the USDA that their facilities will be approved to perform the final field study for Salmogenics Vaccine. The number of birds to be tested is to be determined. This field study is done to determine if any variations exist between previous efficacy studies and studies done in the commercial field. 5. On May 3, 2011 the US Patent Office issued the final patent for Salmogenics Vaccine. OUR PRODUCT We have developed and tested one product, Salmongenics, which we intend to market in the United States initially and later worldwide. The Company owns the rights to Salmogenics in the United States and Canada. The Company has been granted with all marketing rights to Salmogenics in all other countries under the License Agreement. Salmongenics contains the Sotomayor Antigen, which has been patented by the Company. An antigen is a substance that, when introduced into a body, triggers the production of an antibody by the immune system, which will then kill or neutralize the antigen that is recognized as a foreign and potentially harmful invader. The Sotomayor Antigen pertains to a particular composition of multiple germs mainly of the Genus Salmonella in order to control intestinal pathogenic organisms in the chicken species. OUR STRATEGY The Company's objective is to be a leader in the commercialization of salmonella vaccine products. To achieve this objective, we intend to: o Management's current focus is on the final approval by the USDA of the Company's sole product, the Salmogenic vaccine. As the Company, moves closer to final approval, it will begin to develop and focus efforts on marketing and sales of the Salmongenic vaccine. o EXPAND OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS. The Company intends to expand its existing portfolio of product candidates. The Company will take into account market attractiveness, technical feasibility, the potential to develop a proprietary position and the productiveness of animal models in choosing among new product development opportunities. Though, at the time of this filing, management has not taken any efforts and has no plans to take any efforts in this direction. o BROADEN OUR LICENSEE. The Company plans to broaden its portfolio of licenses of and other technologies to develop new products and attract corporate and academic collaborators. We intend to accomplish this through internal and sponsored research, in-licensing and technology acquisitions. Though, at the time of this filing, the Company has not identified any such opportunities. RELATIONSHIP WITH NHIL NHIL owns 89.13% of the Company's common stock and as such is not only the Company's parent company, but also its majority and controlling shareholder. NHIL owns all of the patents and trademarks associated with the salmogenic vaccine. On November 29, 2010, the Company entered into License Agreement with NHIL, our majority shareholder. The License Agreement provides us with exclusive license to performe final phase of USDA study, manufacture, distribute, market and sell the Salmonella Vaccine and the Salmonella Antigen, not only in the United States, but also worldwide. Though, at this time, the Company has not made any plans regarding operations outside of the United States. As part of the consideration of the License Agreement, the Company has agreed to undertake the financial obligations for the acquisition of any patents and obtaining USDA approval, in addition to the issuance of the 683,097,847 shares to NHIL. The License Agreement has no provisions for termination and is perpetual. -34- COMPETITION: Competition among entities attempting to identify and develop new therapies is intense. The Company faces, and will continue to face, competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic and research institutions and government agencies, both in the United States and abroad. Many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, facilities, manufacturing and marketing experience, distribution channels and human resources than the Company. Future competition will likely come from existing competitors, as well as other companies seeking to develop new treatments. At this time, the Company has an exclusive license from NHIL. The Company may be dependent on NHIL for support of certain of its technologies and intends to rely on NHIL for development of any future products. Product candidates of the Company, as it begins to pursue its strategy as discussed above, therefore, may be subject to competition with a potential product under development by NHIL. Rapid technological development by the Company or others may result in products or technologies becoming obsolete before the Company can recover development expenses. Products developed by the Company could be made obsolete by less expensive or more effective technologies, even technologies unrelated to salmonella vaccine. For example, competitors may also develop vaccines that may compete with or obviate the need for the Company's products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to make the enhancements to its technology necessary to compete successfully with existing or newly emerging technologies. GOVERNMENT REGULATION: Prior to marketing, any products developed by the Company must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process in the United States and other countries. This regulatory process, which includes efficacy studies, and may include post-marketing surveillance of each compound to establish its safety and efficacy, can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Data obtained from efficacy studies are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Delays or rejections may also be encountered based upon changes in USDA policies for vaccine approval during the period of product development and USDA regulatory review. Similar delays may also be encountered in obtaining regulatory approval in foreign countries. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of any vaccine developed by the Company or its corporate collaborators, impose costly procedures upon the Company's or its corporate collaborators' activities, diminish any competitive advantages that the Company may attain and adversely affect the Company's receipt of revenues. There can be no assurance that regulatory approval will be obtained for products developed by the Company. Furthermore, regulatory approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses of a proposed product. The regulation of the Company's products and its ongoing research is subject to change, and future legislative or administrative acts in the United States or other countries could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory requirements ultimately imposed could adversely affect the ability of the Company's corporate collaborators to perform efficacy studies, manufacture or market products, and could significantly delay or reduce the milestone or royalty payments payable to the Company. Even if regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continuing review. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in withdrawal of the product from the market, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, including efficacy studies, the approval process, post-approval or in GMP, may result in various adverse consequences to the Company, including the USDA's delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, withdrawal of an approved product from the market or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer and license holder. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to conduct efficacy studies or obtain necessary approvals from the USDA or other regulatory authorities for any products. Further, the terms of approval of any marketing application, including the labeling content, may be more restrictive than we desire and could affect the marketability of the Company's proposed products. Failure to obtain required governmental approvals will delay or preclude the Company or its corporate collaborators from marketing products or limit the commercial use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. -35- FACILITIES The Company operates out of facilities leased by NHIL.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ----------------- We are not a party to any pending legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any civil proceeding or government authority contemplating any legal proceeding. D. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS -------------------------------------------------------- MARKET INFORMATION Currently there is no public trading market for our stock, and we have not applied to have the common stock quoted for trading in any venue. We intend to apply to have the common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board ("OTC/QB") immediately after filing this registration statement. The offering of the shares registered hereby could have a material negative effect on the market price for the stock if it is approved for quotation on the OTC/QB. -37- RULES GOVERNING LOW-PRICE STOCKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO RESELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK Our stock currently is not traded on any stock exchange or quoted on any stock quotation system. After filing the registration statement in which this prospectus is included, we intend to solicit a broker to apply for quotation of common stock on the FINRA's OTC/QB. Quotations on the OTC/QB reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, markdown or commission and may not reflect actual transactions. Our common stock will be subject to certain rules adopted by the SEC that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks." Penny stocks generally are securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that the exchange or system provides current price and volume information with respect to transaction in such securities. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers are and may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of shares in the secondary market. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to make a special suitability determination for the purchaser to receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to sale, to deliver standardized risk disclosure documents prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer's account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks. HOLDERS As of the filing of this prospectus, we have 290 shareholders of record of our common stock. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Under Rule 144(k), a person who has not been one of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least 6 months, is entitled to sell shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144. As of the date of this prospectus, our selling shareholders hold 745,761,432 shares, 147,516,080 shares may be sold pursuant to this Registration Statement, including those of our majority shareholder NHIL for whom we are registering 66,471,705 shares. DIVIDENDS As of the filing of this prospectus, we have not paid any dividends to shareholders. There are no restrictions which would limit our ability to pay dividends on common equity or that are likely to do so in the future. The Florida Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend; we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or our total assets would be less than the sum of the total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.

(A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) (FORMERLY, THE GLOBAL TECH ASSETS, INC.) CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT AND INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT MARCH 31, 2011 (UNAUDITED) AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 (AUDITED) (with Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Thereon) F-1 ACCELL INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Global Green, Inc. We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Green, Inc. (a development stage company) and its wholly owned subsidiary (together, the "Company") as of March 31, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the three months then ended, in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. All information included in these financial statements is the representation of the Board of Directors of Global Green, Inc. A review consists principally of inquiries of Association personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data. It is substantially less in scope than an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying financial statements in order for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. /s/ Accell Audit & Compliance, P.A. Tampa, Florida June 6, 2011 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4868 West Gandy Boulevard * Tampa, Florida 33611 * 813. 440.6380 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- F-2 ACCELL INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Global Green, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Green, Inc. (a development stage company) and its wholly owned subsidiary (together, the "Company") as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended and the cumulative period from July 12, 2004 (inception) to December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Global Green, Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluation of the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Global Green, Inc., as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended and the cumulative period from July 12, 2004 (inception) to December 31, 2010, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in effect in the United States. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company raised additional capital (see Notes 2 and 6). /s/ Accell Audit & Compliance, P.A.

(A Development Stage Company) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2011 (unaudited) and December 31, 2010 and 2009 NOTE 1 NATURE OF ORGANIZATION Global Green, Inc. (the "Company") is a Florida Corporation incorporated on July 12, 2004 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Assets & Services, Inc. In September 2004, the Company was spun out into a separate legal entity. The Company changed its name from The Global Tech Assets, Inc. to Global Green, Inc. in April 2010 and its fiscal period end is December 31. The Company is in the development stage. The principal activities during the development stage include organizing the corporate structure, implementing the Company's business plan and raising capital. Although the Company was formed in 2004, it did not have any operating activities until 2010. In November 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of Global Green International, Inc. ("GGII"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutritional Health Institute Laboratories, LLC ("NHIL"). The Company issued approximately 683 million shares of its common stock, representing 93% of the ownership of the Company, to NHIL. After the above mentioned acquisition, the Company has become a majority-owned subsidiary of NHIL. GGII, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been granted the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, distribute, market and sell a Salmonella and Antigen vaccine (the "Vaccine"). The Licensing Agreement was executed between NHIL and GGII before the Company acquired the 100% ownership of GGII. In February 2011, the Vaccine has been entered into the final phase of becoming a United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") approved vaccine for the in ovo vaccination of chicken eggs to provide immunity against Salmonella bacteria. In May 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted a patent for the method and composition in the Vaccine. NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As seen in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses of $58,383 since inception (July 12, 2004). Management's plans include raising capital through the equity markets to fund operations and eventually, the generating of revenue through its business; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in such activities. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") on the accrual basis of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The significant accounting policies, estimates and related judgments underlying the Company's financial statements are summarized F-8 Global Green, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2011 (unaudited) and December 31, 2010 and 2009 below. In applying these policies, management makes subjective judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at March 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010 and 2009. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company will recognize revenue when a sales transaction closes and the product is accepted by the customer. INCOME TAXES Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Additionally, the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, is required to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset is required. A valuation allowance is provided for the portion of the deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. The Company files income tax returns in the United States and Florida, which are subject to examination by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions. Generally, the statute of limitations related to the Company's federal and state income tax return is three years. The state impact of any federal changes for prior years remains subject to examination for a period up to five years after formal notification to the states. Management has evaluated tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("FASB ASC") 740 and has not identified any significant tax positions, other than those disclosed. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events, the Company evaluated subsequent events through the date of this audit report, the date the financial statements were available for issue.

LIQUIDITY THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM'S REPORT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD THEN ENDED, INCLUDES A "GOING CONCERN" EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH, THAT DESCRIBES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.

At March 31, 2011, the Company had total current liabilities of $500, consisting solely of $500 due to shareholders.

SHORT TERM On a short-term basis, the Company has not generated any revenue or revenues sufficient to cover operations. For short term needs the Company will be dependent on receipt, if any, of offering proceeds. CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has only common stock as its capital resource. The Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures within the next year, however if operations are commenced, substantial capital will be needed to pay for participation, investigation, exploration, acquisition and working capital. NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING The Company does not have capital sufficient to meet its cash needs. The Company will have to seek loans or equity placements to cover such cash needs. Once manufacturing and sales efforts commence, its needs for additional financing is likely to increase substantially. No commitments to provide additional funds have been made by the Company's management or other stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available to the Company to allow it to cover the Company's expenses as they may be incurred. The Company will need substantial additional capital to support its proposed -41- operations. The Company has NO revenues. The Company has NO committed source for any funds as of the date hereof.

Any such borrowing will increase the risk of loss to the investor in the event it is unsuccessful in repaying such loans.

Our officers are spending up to 30 hours per week on our business at this time. At such time as the Company is financially capable of paying salaries, it is anticipated that management will assume full time roles in the Company's operations and be paid accordingly. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST - GENERAL. Our directors and officers are, or may become, in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling shareholder and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, there exist potential conflicts of interest including, among other things, time, efforts and corporation opportunity, involved in participation with such other business entities. While each officer and director of our business is engaged in business activities outside of our business, the amount of time they devote to our business will be up to approximately 30 hours per week. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST - CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES Presently no requirement contained in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or minutes which requires officers and directors of our business to disclose to us business opportunities which come to their attention. Our officers and directors do, however, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to us to disclose to us any business opportunities which come to their attention, in their capacity as an officer and/or director or otherwise. Excluded from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and director of another company. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring an affiliate, associate person or business opportunity from any affiliate or any client of any such person. PROJECTED STAFF STAFFING Currently, we have no employees aside from the President who is part time. This lean staffing is possible in this phase because of our determination to outsource all operating functions. Our staff positions will be filled as budget allows and business demands require, and the positions may be altered in response to business needs. -44- L.

To the best ability and in the best judgment of our officers and directors, any conflicts of interest between us and the personal interests of our officers and directors will be resolved in a fair manner which will protect our interests. Any transactions between us and entities affiliated with our officers and directors will be on terms which are fair and equitable to us. Our Board of Directors intends to continually review all corporate opportunities to further attempt to safeguard against conflicts of interest between their business interests and our interests.

DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Florida Business Corporation Act requires us to indemnify officers and directors for any expenses incurred by any officer or director in connection with any actions or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, brought against such officer or director because of his or her status as an officer or director, to the extent that the director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of the action or proceeding. The Florida Business Corporation Act permits a corporation to indemnify an officer or director, even in the absence of an agreement to do so, for expenses incurred in connection with any action or proceeding if such officer or director acted in good faith and in a manner in which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of us and such indemnification is authorized by the stockholders, by a quorum of disinterested directors, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion authorized by a majority vote of a quorum of directors consisting of disinterested directors, or by independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of disinterested directors cannot be obtained. The Florida Business Corporation Act prohibits indemnification of a director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that the officer's or director's acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law and were material to the cause of action. Despite the foregoing limitations on indemnification, the Florida Business Corporation Act may permit an officer or director to apply to the court for approval of indemnification even if the officer or director is adjudged to have committed intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law. The Florida Business Corporation Act also provides that indemnification of directors is not permitted for the unlawful payment of distributions, except for those directors registering their dissent to the payment of the distribution. -49- According to our bylaws, we are authorized to indemnify our directors to the fullest extent authorized under Florida Law subject to certain specified limitations. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, we are advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. -50- [OUTSIDE BACK COVER PAGE OF PROSPECTUS] DEALER PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS Until one hundred twenty (120) days from the effective date of this registration statement, all dealers that effect transactions in these securities, whether or not participating in this offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus.
