We may redeem any of the Notes beginning on May 1, 2013 at the redemption prices specified in this prospectus. We may also redeem any of the Notes at any time prior to May 1, 2013 at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest and a make-whole premium. At any time prior to May 1, 2013, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes, at a redemption price of 111% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, with the net proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings.

We have not authorized any person to provide you with different information. This prospectus is not an offer to sell, nor is it an offer to buy, these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted. The information in this prospectus is complete and accurate as of the date on the front cover of this prospectus, but our business, financial condition or results of operations may have changed since that date. Table of Contents CAUTIONARY INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain of the statements contained in this prospectus are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenue or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, business trends, the impact of fresh-start accounting, the impact of our bankruptcy on our future performance and other information that is not historical information. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as estimate, believe, expect, anticipate, plan, may, should, continue, budget or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Many of these forward-looking statements have been based on expectations and assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Our actual results (including the results of our joint ventures) could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to:  if we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit facilities and other financing arrangements, those obligations could be accelerated, which we may not be able to repay;  we may be unable to incur additional indebtedness or obtain financing on terms that we deem acceptable, including for refinancing of our current obligations; higher interest rates and costs of financing would increase our expenses;  our ability to implement business strategies may be negatively affected or restricted by, among other things, governmental regulations or policies;  the cost of raw materials represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses, and energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas; price volatility can significantly affect our results of operations and we may be unable to pass raw material and energy cost increases on to our customers;  industry production capacities and operating rates may lead to periods of oversupply and low profitability;  uncertainties associated with worldwide economies create increased counterparty risks, which could reduce liquidity or cause financial losses resulting from counterparty exposure;  the negative outcome of any legal, tax and environmental proceedings may increase our costs;  we may be required to reduce production or idle certain facilities because of the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply-demand balance in the chemical and refining industries, which would negatively affect our operating results;  we may face operating interruptions due to events beyond our control at any of our facilities, which would negatively impact our operating results, and because the Houston refinery is our only North American refining operation, we would not have the ability to increase production elsewhere to mitigate the impact of any outage at that facility;  regulations may negatively impact our business by, among other things, restricting our operations, increasing costs of operations or requiring significant capital expenditures;  we face significant competition due to the commodity nature of many of our products and may not be able to protect our market position or otherwise pass on cost increases to our customers;  we rely on continuing technological innovation, and an inability to protect our technology, or others technological developments could negatively impact our competitive position; and ii Table of Contents  we are subject to the risks of doing business at a global level, including fluctuations in exchange rates, wars, terrorist activities, political and economic instability and disruptions and changes in governmental policies, which could cause increased expenses, decreased demand or prices for our products and/or disruptions in operations, all of which could reduce our operating results. Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations (including those of our joint ventures) and the ultimate accuracy of the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results and future developments (including those of our joint ventures) may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward-looking statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels. iii Table of Contents PROSPECTUS SUMMARY This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus and does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should read the entire prospectus, including the financial data and related notes and the information incorporated by reference into this prospectus, before making an investment decision. In this prospectus, the terms our, we, us, LyondellBasell, the Company, and similar terms refer to LyondellBasell Industries N.V. and include all of our consolidated subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise. When we use Lyondell Chemical or LCC, we are referring to our wholly owned subsidiary and the issuer of the notes, Lyondell Chemical Company. The Company Overview We are the worlds third largest independent chemical company based on revenues and an industry leader in many of our product lines. We are a top worldwide producer of ethylene and polyethylene as well as propylene oxide (PO) and polyethylene (PE) and the worlds largest producer of polypropylene and polypropylene compounds (PP compounds). Additionally, we are a leading provider of technology licenses and a supplier of catalysts for polyolefin production. Our refinery in Houston, Texas (the Houston Refinery) is among North Americas largest full conversion refineries capable of processing significant quantities of heavy, high-sulfur crude oil. We participate in the full petrochemical value chain, from refining to specialized end uses of petrochemical products, and we believe that our vertically integrated facilities, broad product portfolio, manufacturing flexibility, superior technology base and operational excellence allow us to extract value across the full value chain. Emergence from Chapter 11 Proceedings We were formed to serve as the parent holding company for certain subsidiaries of LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A. (LyondellBasell AF) after completion of proceedings under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. LyondellBasell AF and 93 of its subsidiaries were debtors (the Debtors) in jointly administered bankruptcy cases (the Bankruptcy Cases) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). Other subsidiaries of LyondellBasell AF were not involved in the Bankruptcy Cases. On April 23, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court approved our Third Amended and Restated Plan of Reorganization and we emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2010 (the date of our emergence from bankruptcy being the Emergence Date). Prior to the Emergence Date, we had not conducted any business operations. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted or suggested by context, all financial information and data and accompanying financial statements and corresponding notes, as of and prior to the Emergence Date, as contained in this prospectus, reflect the actual historical consolidated results of operations and financial condition of LyondellBasell AF for the periods presented and do not give effect to the Plan of Reorganization or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or the adoption of fresh-start accounting. Thus, such financial information may not be representative of our performance or financial condition after the Emergence Date. Except with respect to such historical financial information and data and accompanying financial statements and corresponding notes or as otherwise noted or suggested by the context, all other information contained in this prospectus relates to us and our subsidiaries following the Emergence Date. As of the Emergence Date, LyondellBasell AFs equity interests in its indirect subsidiaries terminated and we now own and operate, directly and indirectly, substantially the same business as LyondellBasell AF owned and operated prior to emergence from the Bankruptcy Cases. References herein to our historical consolidated financial information (or data derived therefrom) should be read to refer to the historical financial information of LyondellBasell AF. We are the successor to the combination in December 2007 of Lyondell Chemical Company and Basell AF S.C.A. (Basell), which created one of the worlds largest petrochemical companies with significant worldwide scale and leading product positions. 1 Table of Contents General Corporate Information We are a public company with limited liability ( naamloze vennootschap ) incorporated under Dutch law by deed of incorporation dated October 15, 2009.

You should carefully consider the risks below, as well as those contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference, together with all of the other information contained in this prospectus, before deciding to invest in the Notes. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to an Investment in the Notes The value of the security interest in the collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy all our obligations under the Notes. The Notes are secured by (subject to exceptions and permitted liens) a third priority lien on (i) substantially all of the Issuers and each Subsidiary Guarantors existing and future property and assets, (ii) the capital stock of all U.S. subsidiaries of LyondellBasell and each Subsidiary Guarantor (other than any such subsidiary that is a subsidiary of a non-U.S. subsidiary) and (iii) 65% of the capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of all first-tier non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Issuer or of LyondellBasell (subject in the case of the pledges of certain stock to the 3-16 Exemption). In the event of enforcement of the liens securing the Notes, the proceeds thereof will first be applied to repay obligations secured by senior priority liens, including our Senior Term Loan Facility, our ABL Facility and our First Lien Notes, in full before making any payments on the Notes. In the event the proceeds from the collateral are not sufficient to repay the Notes, any remaining Notes outstanding will be general unsecured claims. Many of our assets, such as assets owned by our foreign subsidiaries, are not part of the collateral securing the Notes. In addition, our foreign subsidiaries will be permitted to incur substantial indebtedness in compliance with the covenants under the indenture governing the Notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness. There are no limitations on our ability to transfer assets and cash flow to our non-Guarantor subsidiaries under the indenture, although we have no present intention of transferring any material portion of the Notes collateral in this manner. Upon such a transfer, those assets would be released automatically from the lien securing the Notes. The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers for the collateral. By its nature, some or all of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, competition or other future trends. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the collateral securing our obligations will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes in full or at all. There also can be no assurance that the collateral will be saleable, and, even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the collateral and the ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the collateral. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the collateral securing the Notes and the obligations under the Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. With respect to some of the collateral, the collateral agents security interest and ability to foreclose may be subject to perfection, priority issues, state law requirements and practical problems associated with the realization of the trustees security interest or lien in the collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on the collateral within the time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making additional filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. If we are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that 5 Table of Contents any such required consents can be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. The Note are effectively subordinated to all liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries and structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of all of our foreign subsidiaries. The Notes are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or Guarantors of the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, these non-Guarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to LyondellBasell Industries N.V. or the Issuer. The Notes are not guaranteed by any of LyondellBasell Industries N.V.s non-U.S. subsidiaries. LyondellBasell Industries N.V.s non-U.S. subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the Notes, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that LyondellBasell Industries N.V., the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors have to receive any assets of any of the non-U.S. subsidiaries of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Notes and our other debt agreements allow us to incur substantial debt at our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, all of which would be effectively senior to the Notes and the guarantees to the extent of the assets of those non-Guarantor subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2011, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries had approximately $343 million of outstanding indebtedness, which would rank effectively senior to the Notes offered hereby, with respect to the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, there are no restrictions in the indenture governing the Notes relating to the transfer of funds between restricted subsidiaries, including between Guarantor and non-Guarantor restricted subsidiaries. Holders of the Notes are structurally subordinated to creditors of the non-Guarantors and are subject to the foregoing risks concerning the amount of such structural subordination, among others. Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the Notes, is dependent on cash flow generated by our foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our foreign subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our foreign subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each foreign subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our foreign subsidiaries. While the indenture governing the Notes limits the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from our foreign subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. Holders of notes will not control decisions regarding collateral. Pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, until such time as the outstanding debt under the First Lien Notes is no longer outstanding, the collateral agent for the First Lien Notes and for the ABL Facility will be able to control substantially all matters related to the collateral securing the Notes. The holders of the First Lien Notes (in the case of the Notes Collateral) and the lenders under the ABL Facility (in the 6 Table of Contents case of the ABL Facility Collateral) may cause the collateral agent to dispose of, release or foreclose on, or take other actions with respect to, the shared collateral with which holders of the Notes may disagree or that may be contrary to the interests of holders of the Notes. To the extent liens on shared collateral securing the First Lien Notes and the ABL Facility are released, the liens securing the Notes may also automatically be released. These are substantial consequences to holders of Notes in not having control over decisions with respect to collateral in the first instance, which are described under Description of Notes  Security  Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement that should be carefully reviewed by investors in the Notes. Furthermore, notwithstanding the above paragraph, the security documents generally allow us and our subsidiaries to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, to freely operate, and to collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing the Notes. In addition, to the extent we sell any assets that constitute collateral, the proceeds from such sale will be subject to the lien securing the Notes only to the extent such proceeds would otherwise constitute collateral securing the notes under the security documents. To the extent the proceeds from any such sale of collateral do not constitute collateral under the security documents, the pool of assets securing the notes would be reduced and the notes would not be secured by such proceeds. For instance, if we sell any of our domestic assets which constitute collateral securing the Notes and, with the proceeds from such sale, purchase assets in Europe which we transfer to one of our foreign subsidiaries, the holders of the Notes would not receive a security interest in the assets purchased in Europe and transferred to our foreign subsidiary because the pool of assets which constitutes collateral securing the Notes under the security documents excludes assets owned by our foreign subsidiaries. There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral securing the Notes and guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee. Under various circumstances, collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including:  a sale, transfer or other disposition of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture; and  with respect to collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its guarantee. The guarantee of a subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically released to the extent it is released in connection with a sale of such subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture. The indenture also permits us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a Guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture governing the Notes, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the Notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries that is senior to the claim of the holders of the Notes. See Description of Notes. The collateral securing the Notes may be diluted under certain circumstances. The collateral that secures the Notes also secures our obligations under our first lien indebtedness, on a higher priority basis. This collateral may secure additional indebtedness that we incur in the future on a higher priority basis than the Notes. Your rights to the collateral would be diluted by any increase in the indebtedness secured on a higher priority basis. The collateral securing the Notes may be subject to material exceptions, defects and encumbrances that adversely impact its value. Any exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections on the collateral that secures the first lien indebtedness could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the Notes as well as the 7 Table of Contents ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose on such collateral. In addition, our business requires numerous federal, state and local permits and licenses. Continued operation of properties that are the collateral for the Notes depends on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited. Our business is subject to substantial regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or changes in applicable regulations or requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may result and the value of the collateral may be significantly decreased. State law may limit the ability of the collateral agent, trustee and the holders of the Notes to foreclose on the real property and improvements included in the collateral. The Notes will be secured by, among other things, liens on real property and improvements located in the States of Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana and Texas. The laws of those states may limit the ability of the trustee and the holders of the Notes to foreclose on the improved real property collateral located in those states. Laws of those states govern the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage liens against real property interests which secure debt obligations such as the Notes. These laws may impose procedural requirements for foreclosure different from and necessitating a longer time period for completion than the requirements for foreclosure of security interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even it is has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts and a right of redemption after foreclosure. Governing laws may also impose security first and one form of action rules which can affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral regardless of the location of the collateral and may limit the right to recover a deficiency following a foreclosure. The holders of the Notes and the trustee also may be limited in their ability to enforce a breach of the no liens covenant. Some decisions of state courts have placed limits on a lenders ability to accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens or leasehold estates may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lenders security or to protect against an increased risk of default. Although the foregoing court decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws, the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the trustee and the holders of the Notes from declaring a default and accelerating the Notes by reason of a breach of this covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders to enforce the covenant. Rights of holders of Notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on certain collateral delivered after the issue date or acquired in the future. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest or lien can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the trustee or the collateral agent will monitor, or that we will inform the collateral agent or the administrative agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the lien on such after-acquired collateral. The collateral agent for the Notes has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interests therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the practical benefits of the liens thereon or of the priority of the liens securing the Notes. If we, or any Subsidiary Guarantor, were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, any liens recorded or perfected after the issue date of the Notes would face a greater risk of being invalidated than if they had been recorded or perfected on the issue date of the Notes. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date of the Notes beyond the time period provided for perfecting as permitted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, such as the mortgage described above, may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien 8 Table of Contents perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing debt is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date of the indebtedness. Accordingly, if we or a subsidiary Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the Notes and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the Notes may be especially subject to challenge as a result of having been perfected after their issue date. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, you would lose the benefit of the security that the collateral was intended to provide. The pledge of the capital stock or other securities of the Issuers subsidiaries that secure the Notes will automatically be released from the lien on it and will no longer constitute collateral for so long as the pledge of such capital stock or such other securities would require the filing of separate financial statements with the SEC for such subsidiary. The Notes and the guarantees are secured by a pledge of the stock of some of our subsidiaries. Under the SEC regulations, if the par value, book value as carried by us or market value (whichever is greatest) of the capital stock or other securities of a subsidiary pledged as part of the collateral for any class of securities registered or to be registered is greater than or equal to 20% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, such a subsidiary would be required to provide separate financial statements in filings with the SEC. Therefore, the indenture and the collateral documents provide that any capital stock and other securities of any of our subsidiaries will be excluded from the collateral for so long as the pledge of such capital stock or other securities to secure the Notes would cause such subsidiary to be required to file separate financial statements with the SEC pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X (as in effect from time to time). We have agreed that the 3-16 Exemption will not apply to the pledges of stock of Lyondell Chemical and LyondellBasell Subholdings B.V. and we will file separate financial statements for those entities, if required to do so. As a result, it may be more difficult, costly and time-consuming for holders of the Notes to foreclose on the assets of a subsidiary than to foreclose on its capital stock or other securities, so the proceeds realized upon any such foreclosure could be significantly less than those that would have been received upon any sale of the capital stock or other securities of such subsidiary. See Description of Notes  Security. In the event of bankruptcy, the ability of the holders of the Notes to exercise remedies in respect of the collateral will be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations. The ability of holders of Notes to realize upon the collateral will be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of our bankruptcy following the issuance of the Notes. Under applicable federal bankruptcy laws, upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case, an automatic stay goes into effect which, among other things, stays:  the commencement or continuation of any action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy case to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case;  any act to obtain possession of, or control over, property of the bankruptcy estate or the debtor;  any act to create, perfect or enforce any lien against property of the bankruptcy estate; and  any act to collect or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case. Bankruptcy law could thus prevent, or at a minimum delay, the collateral agent from repossessing and disposing of, or otherwise exercising remedies in respect of, the collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default if a bankruptcy proceeding were to be commenced by or against us or the Guarantors prior to the collateral agent having repossessed and disposed of, or otherwise exercised remedies in respect of, the collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the collateral agent is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from such debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to 9 Table of Contents continue to retain and to use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instrument; provided that the secured creditor is given adequate protection. The meaning of the term adequate protection may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditors interest in the collateral. The court may find adequate protection if the debtor pays cash or grants additional security, if and at such times as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term adequate protection and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments with respect to the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the trustee could repossess or dispose of the collateral or whether or to what extent holders would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of adequate protection. The collateral is subject to casualty risks. We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the Notes and the guarantees. In the event of a total or partial loss to any of the mortgaged facilities, certain items of equipment, fixtures and other improvements may not be easily replaced. Accordingly, even though there may be insurance coverage, the extended period needed to manufacture or construct replacement of such items could cause significant delays. The terms of our indenture governing the Notes may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. The indenture governing the Notes contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to:  incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;  pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;  prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;  make loans and investments;  incur liens;  restrict dividends, loans or asset transfers from our subsidiaries;  sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;  consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person;  enter into transactions with affiliates; and  enter into new lines of business. In addition, our senior secured term loan facility (the Senior Term Loan Facility) requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of the covenants under the indenture that governs the Notes or under the credit agreement governing the Senior Term Loan Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. 10 Table of Contents Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our Senior Term Loan Facility would permit the lenders under our Senior Term Loan Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our Senior Term Loan Facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or holders of Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:  limited in how we conduct our business;  unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or  unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans. In the event of a bankruptcy of us or any of the Guarantors, holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the Notes exceed the fair market value of the collateral securing the Notes. In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to us or any of the Guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the Notes. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim in an amount equal to the value of the collateral and an unsecured claim with respect to the remainder of its claim which would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would be, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the Notes to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs or charges and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes to receive adequate protection under federal bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at any time prior to such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments would be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the Notes. Insolvency laws of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes. Although the Issuer is incorporated in Delaware, LyondellBasell Industries N.V. is organized in The Netherlands. In addition, LyondellBasell Industries N.V. is party to certain of the key agreements affecting your rights as holders of the Notes and your ability to recover under the Notes are incorporated in jurisdictions other than the U.S. The insolvency laws of The Netherlands may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the U.S. or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. U.S. investors in the Notes may have difficulties enforcing certain civil liabilities. The Issuer is an entity incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. However, LyondellBasell Industries N.V. is organized under the laws of The Netherlands. LyondellBasell Industries N.V. has agreed, in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the Notes will be issued, to accept service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the indenture or the Notes brought in any federal or state court located in New York City by an agent designated for such purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits, actions or proceedings. However, it may be difficult for securityholders to enforce judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against certain of LyondellBasell Industries N.V.s assets. A judgment of a U.S. court based solely upon civil liability under those laws may be unenforceable outside of the U.S. In 11 Table of Contents addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the U.S. or elsewhere may be unenforceable in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Fraudulent transfer and other laws may permit a court to void the guarantees, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the guarantees. The issuance of the Notes and the guarantees may be subject to review under federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes if a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit, including under circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were commenced at some future date by us, by the Guarantors or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a Guarantor. While the relevant laws may vary from state to state, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the Notes and the guarantees, and the granting of the security interests in respect thereof, will generally be a fraudulent conveyance if (i) the consideration was paid with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) we or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the Notes or a guarantee, and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true:  we or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors were or was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the Notes or the guarantees;  payment of the consideration left us or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business; or  we or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our or its ability to pay as they mature. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the Notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or such subsidiary Guarantor, require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such guarantee or void or otherwise decline to enforce the security interests and related security agreements in respect thereof. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. Further, the voidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of our Subsidiary Guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:  the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;  the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or  it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the Subsidiary Guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or regardless of the standard used, that the issuance of the Notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any Subsidiary Guarantors other debt. If the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Subsidiary Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable subsidiary Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable subsidiary Guarantors other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes. In addition, a recent bankruptcy court decision in Florida questioned the validity of a customary savings clause in a guarantee. 12 Table of Contents The Issuer may not be able to fulfill its repurchase obligations in the event of a change of control. Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. Additionally, under the indenture governing our 8% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the First Lien Notes), upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events (as defined therein), we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding First Lien Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. Further, under the Senior Term Loan Facility, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the respective agreements and the commitments to lend would terminate. The source of funds for any purchase of the Notes and repayment of borrowings under our Senior Term Loan Facility will be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes and events of default and potential breaches of the credit agreement governing our new Senior Term Loan Facility, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us. Our failure to make the change of control offer or to pay the change of control purchase price when due would result in a default under the indenture governing the Notes. See Description of Notes  Change of Control. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture governing the Notes, constitute a change of control that would require us to repurchase the Notes, notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the Notes. See the section titled Description of Notes  Change of Control. In addition, the definition of change of control in the indenture governing the Notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase substantially all under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. If an active trading market does not develop for the Notes, you may not be able to resell them. There is no established trading market for the Notes and an active trading market for the Notes may not develop, in which case the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. In addition, you may not be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or at a price favorable to you. Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including:  our operating performance and financial condition;  our prospects or the prospects for companies in our industry generally;  the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Notes;  the market for similar securities; and  prevailing interest rates. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused volatility in the prices of these securities. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. A disruption may have a negative effect on you as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects or performance. 13 Table of Contents A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by any rating agency to the Notes or to us could cause the liquidity or market value of the Notes to decline. We and the Notes have been rated by nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations, and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. Any rating so assigned may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agencys judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse change to our business, so warrant. Any lowering or withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency could reduce the liquidity or market value of the Notes. USE OF PROCEEDS We are registering the resale of the Notes pursuant to registration rights granted to the selling security holders in the Registration Rights Agreement dated April 30, 2010 (the Registration Rights Agreement). We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The Notes being offered by this prospectus may be sold from time to time to purchasers directly by the selling security holders listed in the table set forth in Selling Security Holders and their donees, pledges, transferees or any of their successors-in-interest or, alternatively, through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. The selling security holders may offer the Notes at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected in one or more transactions, which may involve block transactions, transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options or a combination of any such methods of resale. In connection with sales of the Notes, the selling security holders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, who may in turn engage in short sales of the Notes in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling security holders may also sell the Notes short and deliver them to close out the short positions, or loan or pledge the Notes to broker-dealers that in turn may sell them. The selling security holders and any of their brokers, dealers or agents who participate in the distribution of the Notes may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, and any profits on the sale of the Notes by them and any discounts, commissions, or concessions received by any brokers, dealers or agents might be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act of 1933. Selling security holders who are deemed to be underwriters will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no plans, arrangements or understandings between any selling security holders and any broker, dealer agent or underwriter regarding the sale of the Notes by the selling security holders. There can be no assurance that the selling security holders will sell any or all of the Notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. Further, we cannot assure that any selling security holder will not transfer, devise or gift the Notes by other means not described in this prospectus. At any time a particular offer of the Notes is made, a revised prospectus or supplement, if required by applicable law, will be distributed that will set forth the aggregate principal amount of Notes being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any underwriters, dealers or agents, any discounts, commissions and other items constituting compensation from the selling security holders and any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers. Any supplement and, if necessary, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the disclosure of additional information with respect to the distribution of the Notes. In addition, the Notes covered by this prospectus may be sold in private transactions or under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. 14 Table of Contents Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify, which indemnification may be against public policy, the selling security holders against specified liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933 and to pay substantially all of the expenses incidental to the registration, offering and sale of the Notes to the public other than commissions, fees and discounts of underwriters, brokers, dealers and agents. SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS This prospectus covers the offering of up to $602,883,016 principal amount of Notes by the selling security holders. When we refer to selling security holders in this prospectus, we mean the persons listed in the table below, and the pledgees, donees, transferees, assignees, successors-in-interest and others who later come to hold any of the selling security holders Notes other than through public sale. The selling security holders may from time to time offer and sell all or a portion of their Notes in over-the-counter market or privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices. See Plan of Distribution. In addition, the selling security holders may have sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, at any time or from time to time, the Notes in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 after the date on which they provided the information set forth below. The following table sets forth information as of June 24, 2011, regarding the selling security holders beneficial ownership of the Notes. The selling security holders acquired all of the Notes being registered in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy proceedings on April 30, 2010 in exchange for certain claims against our predecessor in the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The selling security holders may offer and sell, from time to time, any or all of the Notes. Because the selling security holders may offer all or only some portion of the Notes, no estimate can be given as to the amount or percentage of these Notes that will be held by the selling security holders upon termination of the offering.

RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES The following table sets forth our consolidated ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the periods: Successor Predecessor Three Months May 1 January 1 Three Months Ended through through Ended March 31, December 31, April 30, March 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2010 2010 2009 2008 2007 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges(a) 6.14 x 3.71 x 10.73 x 0.95 x   3.44x (a) For the years 2009 and 2008, earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $4,076 million and $8,131 million, respectively. We computed our consolidated ratios of earnings to fixed charges by dividing earnings available for fixed charges by fixed charges. For this purpose, earnings available for fixed charges consists of earnings before income taxes, undistributed earnings from affiliated companies non-controlling interests, cumulative effect of accounting changes, and fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest. Fixed charges are interest, whether expensed or capitalized, amortization of debt expense and discount on premium relating to indebtedness, and such portion of rental expense that can be demonstrated to be representative of the interest factor in the particular case. We did not have any preferred stock outstanding and there were no preferred stock dividends paid or accrued during the periods presented above. DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES General In this Description of the Notes, the term the Company refers only to LyondellBasell Industries N.V. and references to the Issuer refer to Lyondell Chemical Company. Additionally, the term Guarantors refers to any Person (other than the Issuer) that executes the Indenture relating to the Notes or who executes a 16 Table of Contents supplemental indenture in which such Person agrees to be bound by the terms of the Indenture as a guarantor, as more fully described under  The Guarantees. The Notes were issued under the indenture dated April 30, 2010 between the Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee), and the other parties thereto (the Indenture). The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Security Documents and the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of those agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein and those terms made a part thereof by the Trust Indenture Act. Capitalized terms used in this Description of Notes and not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth under  Certain Definitions. We have issued Notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of $3,240,225,105. The Issuer may issue additional Notes from time to time. Any offering of additional Notes is subject to the covenants described under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and  Certain Covenants  Liens. The Notes and any additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture may, at our election, be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of Notes, references to the Notes include any additional Notes actually issued. There can be no assurances, however, that any additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as fungible with the Notes of the relevant series for United States federal income tax purposes or under the laws of any other jurisdiction. Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable, and the Notes may be transferred, at the office or agency designated by the Issuer (which initially will be the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee, as Paying Agent). The Notes were issued by the Issuer in denominations of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof. Terms of the Notes The Notes are senior Obligations of the Issuer, have the benefit of the third priority security interest in the Notes Collateral and the ABL Facility Collateral described under  Security and mature on May 1, 2018. Each Note bears interest at a rate of 11.000% per annum from the Issue Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semiannually to holders of record at the close of business on the January 15 and July 15 immediately preceding the interest payment date on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Redemption Optional Redemption At any time prior to May 1, 2013, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any additional Notes), at a redemption price of 111.000% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, with the net proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that: (1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture (together with any additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Company and its Subsidiaries); and (2) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering. In addition, prior to May 1, 2013, the Issuer may redeem the Notes (including any additional Notes) at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior 17 Table of Contents notice mailed by first-class mail to each holders registered address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). On or after May 1, 2013, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Notes (including any additional Notes) upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice mailed by first-class mail to each holders registered address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Selection Selection of Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable; provided that no Notes of $100,000, as applicable, principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Issuer has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest (if any) on, the Notes to be redeemed. If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time in connection with an optional redemption, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption as follows:  if the Notes to be redeemed are listed, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which such Notes are listed; or  if the Notes to be redeemed are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase or redeem Notes as described under  Change of Control and  Certain Covenants  Asset Sales. The Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliates of the Company may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise. Ranking The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, and senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer. The Notes have the benefit of (i) a third priority security interest in the Notes Collateral that is junior in priority to the Senior Term Loan Facility, the First Lien Notes, the ABL Facility and all other existing and future First Priority Lien Obligations and Second Priority Lien Obligations with respect to all Notes Collateral, (ii) a third priority security in the ABL Facility Collateral that is junior in priority to the ABL Facility, the Senior Term Loan Facility, the First Lien Notes and all other existing and future First Priority Lien Obligations and Second Priority Lien Obligations, in each case subject to Permitted Liens and exceptions described under  Security  General. In addition, the Notes are pari passu in priority with all other existing and future Junior Lien Obligations with respect to all Collateral, in each case subject to Permitted Liens and exceptions described under  Security  General. 18 Table of Contents The covenants under the Indenture permit substantial amounts of additional Indebtedness to be Incurred at Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors and that may be secured with assets that are not Collateral for the Notes, as well as Indebtedness that may be secured on a pari passu or junior basis on the Collateral. The Guarantees The Guarantors The Company, each existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect Wholly-Owned Domestic Subsidiary of the Company, and each other entity, if any, that guarantees the First Lien Notes or the Senior Term Loan Facility (other than any Excluded Subsidiary) (each such entity, a Guarantor), jointly and severably, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee on a senior third-priority secured basis the performance and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes (the Guarantee). Such Guarantors agree that they will pay principal of, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any, on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise. Such Guarantors agree to pay, in addition to the amounts stated above, any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the holders in enforcing any rights under the Guarantees. The Guarantees of the Notes are:  senior secured Obligations of the Guarantors; and  equal in right of payment to all existing and future unsubordinated Indebtedness of the Guarantors. The Obligations of any Guarantor, including the Company, under its Guarantee of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged when any of the following occurs: (1) upon the full and final payment by or on behalf of the Issuer of all of its Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes; (2) except with respect to the Guarantee of the Company (subject to the provisions described under  Certain Covenants  Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All of the Assets), any issuance, sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including, without limitation, by way of acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, transfer, conveyance or otherwise), directly or indirectly, of Capital Stock of such Guarantor (or any parent of such Guarantor) to any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that results in such Guarantor ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; provided that such issuance, sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition is made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture; (3) except with respect to the Guarantee of the Company, the designation of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture; (4) except with respect to the Guarantee of the Company (subject to the provisions described under  Certain Covenants  Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All of the Assets), upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor; provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred or is continuing or would be caused thereby; (5) except for the guarantee by the Company, the occurrence of legal defeasance or covenant defeasance in accordance with the Indenture; (6) except for Guarantee by the Company and for those limitations described in the following paragraph, in the event that the continued Obligation of such Guarantor under its Guarantee or the continued existence of such Guarantee will result in a violation of applicable law that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company or such Guarantor; provided that all guarantees, if any, of all First Priority Lien Obligations by such Guarantor are also released; or 19 Table of Contents (7) upon such Guarantor being designated as an Excluded Subsidiary in compliance with the Indenture and the Company gives written notice of such release to the Trustee. In addition to the existing Guarantors, other Domestic Subsidiaries may become Guarantors as provided in the Indenture. The Obligations of the Guarantors under their Guarantees are limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Notes  Fraudulent transfer and other laws may permit a court to void the guarantees, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the guarantees. Withholding Taxes All payments made under or with respect to the Notes and Guarantees by the Issuer, the Company, or any successors or assignees thereof (each such person, a  Payor ) will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and other similar liabilities related thereto) of whatever nature (collectively,  Taxes ) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which any Payor is organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or through which any Payor makes any payment on the Notes or its Guarantee or any department or political subdivision thereof (each, a  Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction ), unless such Payor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If any Payor is required by law to withhold or de-duct any amount for or on account of Taxes of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or such Guarantee, the Payor, shall make all such deductions and with-holdings in respect of Taxes, and shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld in respect of Taxes to the relevant taxation authority or other governmental authority in accordance with the applicable requirements of law. If any Payor is so required by law to withhold or deduct, such Payor shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts in respect of such withholding or deduction on account of Taxes to the holders of the Notes. Security General The Notes and the Guarantees are secured by third priority security interests in the Notes Collateral and by third priority security interests in the ABL Facility Collateral, in each case subject to Permitted Liens. The First Lien Notes and the Senior Term Loan Facility are secured by first priority security interests in the Notes Collateral and second priority security interests in the ABL Facility Collateral. The ABL Facility is secured by first priority security interests in the ABL Facility Collateral and second priority security interests in the Notes Collateral. The Notes Collateral consists of (i) substantially all the present and after-acquired assets of the Issuer and the Pledgors, including, without limitation, the following property: all accounts receivable and inventory (other than the ABL Facility Collateral), equipment, general intangibles, investment property, intellectual property, Owned Real Property (subject to clause (i) of the definition of Excluded Assets as described below), 65% of the voting Capital Stock and 100% of the non-voting Capital Stock of all first-tier Foreign Subsidiaries of the Issuer and 100% of the Capital Stock of all Domestic Subsidiaries of the Issuer and each Pledgor, intercompany notes and proceeds of the foregoing of the Issuer and each Pledgor, (ii) 65% of the voting Capital Stock of all first-tier Foreign Subsidiaries of the Company and 100% of the non-voting Capital Stock of all first-tier Foreign Subsidiaries of the Company and 100% of the Capital Stock of all Domestic Subsidiaries of the Company, including the Issuer and (iii) any other assets that secure the First Lien Notes. The Notes Collateral does not include, subject to certain exceptions, (i) any fee-Owned Real Property with a value of less than $25.0 million and all leasehold interests (other than interest in ground leases agreed on the Issue Date), (ii) motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title, letter of credit rights and commercial tort claims, (iii) assets specifically requiring perfection through control agreements ( i.e. , cash, 20 Table of Contents deposit accounts or other bank or securities accounts, etc.), (iv) the Capital Stock of any Joint Venture, or of any special purpose subsidiary whose material assets are comprised solely of the Capital Stock of such Joint Venture, where the pledge of such Capital Stock would be prohibited by any applicable contractual requirement pertaining to such Joint Venture, (v) the ABL Facility Collateral, (vi) preferred stock issued in connection with a Structured Finance Transaction that is (x) on the Issue Date is subject to an existing Lien on the Issue Date or (y) prohibited from being pledged, and (vii) certain other exceptions described in the Security Documents (all such excluded assets referred to as Excluded Assets ). In addition, to the extent that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act requires or would require (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, that would require) the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any Subsidiary of the Company due to the fact that such Subsidiarys Capital Stock secures the Notes, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed not to be part of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement and only for so long as required to not be subject to such requirement (such requirement, the 3-16 Exemption ); provided that the 3-16 Exemption will not apply to the capital stock of the Issuer and LyondellBasell Subholdings, B.V. In such event, the Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder of such Notes, to the extent necessary to release the security interests in favor of the Collateral Agent on the shares of Capital Stock of such Subsidiary that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Notes Collateral. In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, that would permit) such Subsidiarys Capital Stock to secure the Notes in excess of the amount then pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary will automatically be deemed to be a part of the Notes Collateral. The 3-16 Exemption will apply to the Collateral securing the Notes if it applies to the Collateral securing the First Lien Notes. The ABL Facility Collateral consists of all present and after-acquired inventory, accounts receivable, related contracts and other rights, deposit accounts into which proceeds of the foregoing are credited and books and records related thereto, together with all proceeds of the foregoing, in each case to the extent of the rights, title and interest therein of any Borrower under the ABL Facility. In connection with any enforcement action with respect to the Notes Collateral or any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, all proceeds of the Notes Collateral (after paying the fees and expenses of the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent, Senior Term Loan Collateral Agent, First Lien Paying Agent and First Lien Trustee and any expenses of selling or otherwise foreclosing on the Notes Collateral) will be applied pro rata to the repayment of the First Priority Lien Obligations and the Second Priority Lien Obligations, with any excess proceeds applied to the repayment of the Obligations under the Notes. In connection with any enforcement action with respect to the ABL Facility Collateral or any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, all proceeds of the ABL Facility Collateral (after paying the fees and expenses of the ABL Collateral Agent and any expenses of selling or otherwise foreclosing on such collateral) will be applied to the repayment of the Obligations under the ABL Facility, with any excess proceeds of such enforcement action applied first to the repayment of the First Priority Lien Obligations and any other then outstanding Second Priority Lien Obligations and any additional excess proceeds applied to the repayment of the Obligations under the Notes, each on a pro rata basis after payment of all fees and expenses of the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent, Senior Term Loan Collateral Agent, First Lien Paying Agent and First Lien Trustee. The Company, the Issuer and the Pledgors will be able to Incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could share in the Collateral, including Additional First Priority Lien Obligations, and Additional Second Priority Lien Obligations. Under certain circumstances, the amount of such Additional First Priority Lien Obligations, Additional Second Priority Lien Obligations and additional Indebtedness could be significant. 21 Table of Contents After-Acquired Collateral Subject to Permitted Liens and the 3-16 Exemption and the Excluded Assets limitations, if any of the Issuer, the Company or any Pledgor creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset that would constitute Notes Collateral to secure any First Priority Lien Obligations (which include Obligations in respect of Secured Credit Facility Indebtedness), it must concurrently grant (i) a first priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon such property as security for the First Lien Notes and the Senior Term Loan Facility, (ii) a second priority security interest upon such property as security for the ABL Facility and (iii) a third priority security interest upon such property as security for the Notes. In addition, if granting a security interest in such property requires the consent of a third party, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent (i) with respect to the first priority security interest for the benefit of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the First Lien Notes and for the benefit the Senior Term Loan Agent on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Term Loan Facility, (ii) with respect to the second priority security interest for the benefit of the ABL Collateral Agent on behalf of the lenders under ABL Facility and (iii) with respect to the third priority security interest for the benefit of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes. If such third party does not consent to the granting of the first priority security interest after the use of such commercially reasonable efforts, the applicable entity will not be required to provide such security interest. The Issuer, the Company and the Pledgors will also ensure that first, second and third priority security interests are maintained as security for the Notes in any property or assets pledged to secure the First Priority Lien Notes, the Senior Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility. Security Documents The Company, the Issuer, the Pledgors, and the Collateral Agent entered into a security agreement (as amended, supplemented, modified, extended, restructured, renewed, restated or replaced in whole or in part from time to time, the Security Agreement ) that established the terms of the security interests and Liens that secure the Notes. These security interests secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and the Guarantors under the Guarantee, as provided in the Security Documents. Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Company, the Issuer and the Pledgors have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Notes Collateral (other than any cash, securities, Obligations and Cash Equivalents constituting part of the Notes Collateral and deposited with the administrative agent under the Senior Term Loan Facility in accordance with the provisions of the Security Documents and other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Notes Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement The First Lien Notes Collateral Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the First Priority Lien Notes, the Senior Term Loan Collateral Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the ABL Collateral Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of the administrative agent and lenders under the ABL Facility, the Trustee (together with the Collateral Agent, the Senior Term Loan Collateral Agent and the ABL Collateral Agent, the Applicable Collateral Agents ), on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Notes, the Company, the Issuer and the Pledgors entered into an intercreditor agreement (the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement ) that sets forth the relative priority of the Liens securing any First Priority Lien Obligations, the Liens securing the ABL Obligations and the Liens securing any Junior Lien Obligations, including the Notes (collectively, the Applicable Obligations ). Although the holders of First Priority Lien Obligations, ABL Obligations and Junior Lien Obligations are not parties to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, by their acceptance of the Notes, the loans under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the loans under the ABL Facility or the First Lien Notes, respectively, each agreed to be bound thereby. In addition, the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that it may be amended from time to time without the consent of the holders of the Notes to add Additional First Lien Secured Parties with respect to Additional First Priority Lien Obligations and/or additional secured parties with respect to 22 Table of Contents Additional Junior Lien Obligations, in each case to the extent permitted to be Incurred under the First Lien Indenture, the Senior Term Loan Facility, the ABL Facility and the Indenture. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides, among other things:  Lien Priority. Notwithstanding the time, order or method of grant, creation, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any ABL Obligations (the ABL Facility Liens ), the Liens securing any First Priority Lien Obligations (the First Priority Obligation Liens ) or the Liens securing any Junior Lien Obligation (the Junior Priority Liens ) or the enforceability of any such Liens or Obligations, (1) the ABL Facility Liens on the ABL Facility Collateral will rank senior to any First Priority Obligation Liens or Junior Priority Liens on the ABL Facility Collateral, (2) the First Priority Obligation Liens on the Notes Collateral will rank senior to any ABL Facility Liens or Junior Priority Liens on the Notes Collateral, (3) the ABL Facility Liens on the Notes Collateral will rank senior to any Junior Priority Liens on the Notes Collateral, (4) the First Priority Obligation Liens on the ABL Facility Collateral will rank senior to any Junior Priority Liens on the ABL Facility Collateral and (5) the Junior Priority Liens on all Collateral will rank junior to the ABL Facility Liens on all Collateral and the First Priority Obligation Liens on all Collateral.  Prohibition on Contesting Liens and Obligations. No Applicable Collateral Agent or holder of any Applicable Obligation may contest or support any other person in contesting the validity or enforceability of the Liens of any other Applicable Collateral Agent or holder of any other class of Applicable Obligations.  Similar Liens. So long as there are at least two classes of Applicable Obligations outstanding, neither the Company nor any Guarantor will grant any Lien to secure any class of Applicable Obligations unless the Company or such Guarantor has granted a Lien to secure each other class of then outstanding Applicable Obligations; provided that (i) the Company may secure obligations under the Notes with Liens on certain European assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by the Senior Term Loan Facility, the ABL Facility and the Indenture, without granting a Lien on such European assets to secure the ABL Obligations or any First Priority Lien Obligations and (ii) the foregoing provisions shall not be deemed violated by virtue of the operation of the 3-16 Exemption with respect to the Notes or the First Lien Notes. Any proceeds from any Lien granted in contravention of the foregoing will be subject to distribution in accordance with  Application of Proceeds and Turn-Over Provisions below.  Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to ABL Facility Collateral. Subject to the provisions described below under  Standstill Period, the ABL Collateral Agents will have the sole power to exercise remedies against the ABL Facility Collateral (subject to the right of any First Lien Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee to take limited protective measures with respect to the First Priority Obligation Liens and the Junior Priority Liens, respectively, and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the ABL Facility Collateral.

The Applicable Collateral Agent that is then entitled to exercise remedies against the ABL Facility Collateral pursuant to the three prior sentences shall be referred to as the Authorized ABL Collateral Agent and each other Applicable Collateral Agent at such time shall be referred to as the Non-Authorized ABL Collateral Agent . Upon any sale of any ABL Facility Collateral in connection with any enforcement action consented to by the Authorized ABL Collateral Agent, which results in the release of the Liens of such Authorized ABL Collateral Agent on such item of ABL Facility 23 Table of Contents Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item of ABL Facility Collateral will be automatically released.  Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to Notes Collateral. Subject to the provisions described below under  Standstill Period, the First Lien Notes Collateral Agents (subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) will have the sole power to exercise remedies against the Notes Collateral (subject to the right of the ABL Collateral Agent and the Trustee to take limited protective measures with respect to the ABL Facility Liens and the Junior Priority Liens, respectively, and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the Notes Collateral.

No Applicable Collateral Agent or holder of Applicable Obligations may support any plan of reorganization or file any proof of claim in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding which, in either case, is not in accordance with the intercreditor provisions described above.  Standstill Period. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, notwithstanding any of the provisions described above, if prior to the commencement of an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, after a period (the ABL Collateral Standstill Period ) of 180 consecutive days has elapsed from the date of delivery of written notice to the Authorized ABL Collateral Agent stating that the existence of an Event of Default as defined under the debt documents of any Non-Authorized ABL Class of Obligations has occurred and is continuing thereunder, and as a result of such Event of Default the principal and interest under such other Non-Authorized ABL Class of Obligations has become due and payable, then, upon notice to the Authorized ABL Collateral Agent indicating that applicable Non-Authorized ABL Collateral Agent intends to exercise remedies and enforce against the ABL Facility Collateral, then such Non-Authorized ABL Collateral Agent may exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff) with respect to any ABL Facility Collateral (including, without limitation, the enforcement of or execution on any judgment Lien) or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies only so long as the Authorized ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of the Authorized ABL Class of Obligations shall not have commenced and be diligently pursuing (within such 180 consecutive day period) the exercise of any of their rights or remedies with respect to the ABL Facility Collateral; provided that if the Authorized Collateral Agent shall have provided notice as set forth above and shall have commenced and be diligently pursuing (within such 180 consecutive day period) the exercise of any of their rights or remedies with respect to the ABL Facility Collateral, then the Trustee shall be prohibited from exercising remedies against ABL Facility Collateral. In addition, the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that, notwithstanding any of the provisions described above, if prior to the commencement of an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, after a period (the Notes Collateral Standstill Period ) of 180 consecutive days has elapsed from the date of delivery of written notice to the Authorized Notes Collateral Agent stating that the existence of an Event of Default as defined under the debt documents of any Non-Authorized Notes Class of Obligations has occurred and is continuing thereunder, and as a result of such Event of Default the principal and interest under such Non-Authorized Notes Class of Obligations has become due and payable, then, upon notice to the Authorized Notes Collateral Agent indicating that applicable Non-Authorized Notes Collateral Agent intends to exercise remedies and enforce against the Notes Collateral, then such Non-Authorized Notes Collateral Agent may exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff) with respect to any Notes Collateral (including, without limitation, the enforcement of or execution on any judgment Lien) or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies only so long as the Authorized Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the Authorized Notes Class of Obligations shall not have commenced and be diligently pursuing (within such 180 consecutive day period) the exercise of any of their rights or remedies with respect to the Notes Collateral; provided that if the ABL Collateral Agent shall have provided notice as set forth above and shall have commenced and be diligently pursuing (within such 180 consecutive day period) the exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Notes Collateral, then the Trustee shall be prohibited from exercising remedies against Notes Collateral. 26 Table of Contents Release of Collateral Subject to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, Liens on Collateral securing the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released: (1) as to any property or asset (including Capital Stock of a Subsidiary of the Company), to enable the Company, the Issuer and the Pledgors to consummate the disposition of such property or asset to the extent not prohibited by clause (5) below or under the covenants described under  Certain Covenants  Asset Sales or  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Restricted Payments; (2) upon the release of all Liens on such property or assets securing First and Second Priority Lien Obligations (including all commitments and letters of credit thereunder); provided , however , that if the Issuer or the Company subsequently incurs (i) First Priority Lien Obligations that are secured by Liens on property or assets of the Issuer or the Company of the type constituting the Collateral and the related Liens are incurred in reliance on clauses (6)(B) or (6)(D) of the definition of Permitted Liens or (ii) Second Priority Lien Obligations that are secured by Liens on property or assets of the Issuer or the Company of the type constituting the Collateral and the related Liens are incurred in reliance on clause (6)(C) of the definition of Permitted Liens, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be required to reinstitute the security arrangements with respect to the Collateral in favor of the Notes, which, in the case of any such subsequent First Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations, will be junior priority Liens on the Collateral securing such First Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations to the same extent provided by the Security Documents and on the terms and conditions of the security documents relating to such First Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations, with the junior priority Lien held either by the administrative agent, collateral agent or other representative for such First Priority Lien Obligations or Second Priority Lien Obligations and subject to an intercreditor agreement that provides the administrative agent or collateral agent substantially the same rights and powers as afforded under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement; (3) in respect of the property and assets of a Pledgor, upon the designation of such Pledgor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant described under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Restricted Payments and the definition of Unrestricted Subsidiary; (4) in respect of the property and assets of a Guarantor upon release of the Guarantee with respect to the Notes of such Guarantor; (5) in the case of the property and assets of a specific Pledgor, upon such Pledgor making a Transfer of such assets to any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Pledgor; provided that (i) such Transfer is not subject to the covenant described under  Mergers or Transfers of Assets and (ii) the aggregate net book value of the assets of Restricted Subsidiaries that are at any time Notes Collateral (excluding cash proceeds of accounts receivable, inventory and related assets) that are so transferred pursuant to this clause (5) shall not exceed 5% of the Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries per year and shall not be in an amount that will result in an Excluded Subsidiary ceasing to qualify as an Excluded Subsidiary in accordance with the definition thereof; provided further, that Liens on all property and assets of any Subsidiary of Lyondell Europe Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, will be automatically and unconditionally released upon any transfer of such Subsidiary; (6) as described under  Amendments and Waivers below; or (7) as to the pledge of Capital Stock of first-tier Foreign Subsidiaries, in connection with a reorganization, change or modification of the direct or indirect ownership of Foreign Subsidiaries by the Company, the Issuer or a Pledgor, as applicable, in compliance with the Indenture, a release may be obtained as to such Capital Stock in connection with the substitution of pledge of 65% of the voting Capital Stock and 100% of the non-voting Capital Stock of any one or more new or replacement first- tier Foreign Subsidiaries pursuant to valid Security Documents. 27 Table of Contents Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (2), if an Event of Default exists on the date of Discharge of First and Second Priority Lien Obligations, the Junior Priority Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes will not be released, except to the extent that the Collateral or any portion thereof was disposed of in order to repay the First and Second Priority Lien Obligations secured by the Collateral, and thereafter the Trustee (or another designated representative acting at the direction of holders of a majority of outstanding principal amount of the Notes and other Junior Lien Obligations) will have the right to direct the Agent to foreclose upon the Collateral (but in such event, the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes will be released when such Event of Default and all other Events of Default cease to exist). The security interests in all Collateral securing the Notes also will be released upon (i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), are paid (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as described under  Satisfaction and Discharge) , (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as described under  Defeasance, or (iii) the holders of at least 66% in aggregate principal amount of all Notes consent to termination of the Security Documents. Any certificate or opinion required by Section 314(d) of the TIA may be made by an Officer of the Issuer, except in cases where Section 314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent engineer, appraiser or other expert. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will not be required to comply with all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the TIA if they determine, in good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of that section and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC and its staff, including no action letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the TIA is inapplicable to the released Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, certain no action letters issued by the SEC have permitted an indenture qualified under the TIA to contain provisions permitting the release of collateral from Liens under such indenture in the ordinary course of the issuers business without requiring the issuer to provide certificates and other documents under Section 314(d) of the TIA. The Issuer, the Company and the Pledgors may, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee, the Collateral Agent or Senior Term Loan Collateral Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation:  selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien of the Security Documents that has become worn out, defective, obsolete or not used or useful in the business;  abandoning, terminating, canceling, releasing or making alterations in or substitutions of any leases or contracts subject to the Lien of the Indenture or any of the Security Documents;  surrendering or modifying any franchise, license or permit subject to the Lien of the Security Documents that it may own or under which it may be operating;  altering, repairing, replacing, changing the location or position of and adding to its structures, machinery, systems, equipment, fixtures and appurtenances;  granting a license of any intellectual property;  selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of inventory or accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business;  making cash payments (including for the repayment of Indebtedness or interest) from cash that is at any time part of the Collateral in the ordinary course of business that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture and the Security Documents; and 28 Table of Contents  abandoning any intellectual property that is no longer used or useful in the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Change of Control Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such holders Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to the extent the Issuer has previously or concurrently elected to redeem Notes as described under  Redemption  Optional Redemption. In the event that at the time of such Change of Control the terms of any First Priority Lien Obligation or Second Priority Lien Obligation restrict or prohibit the repurchase of Notes, then within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will (i) repay in full all such Indebtedness under the First or Second Priority Lien Obligations, as applicable, that contains such restriction or prohibition or, if doing so will allow repurchase of Notes, offer to repay in full all such Credit Facility Indebtedness and repay such Credit Facility Indebtedness owed to each lender and/or noteholder who has accepted such offer or (ii) obtain the requisite consent under the agreements governing such First Priority Lien Obligation or Second Priority Lien Obligation, as applicable, to permit the repurchase of the Notes as provided for in the immediately following paragraph; it being understood that failure to repay in full all such Indebtedness under the First Priority Lien Obligation or Second Priority Lien Obligation, as applicable, or obtain such requisite consent, shall not release the Issuer of its obligation to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) and repurchase the Notes as required hereunder. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes by delivery of a notice of redemption as described under  Redemption  Optional Redemption, the Issuer shall mail a notice (a Change of Control Offer ) to each holder with a copy to the Trustee stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Issuer to repurchase such holders Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of Control; (3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and (4) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased. Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. In addition, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the consummation of a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the time and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. 29 Table of Contents Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers of the Notes. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuers capital structure or credit rating. The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would also constitute an event of default under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the First Lien Indenture and the ABL Facility. Future Credit Facilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Credit Facilities to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Credit Facility, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuers ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuers then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. Certain Covenants Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that are contained in the Indenture, which (in the absence of a Covenant Suspension Event (as defined below)) will bind the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. If on any date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below) (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a Covenant Suspension Event ), the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Description of Notes will not be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the Suspended Covenants ): (1)  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (2)  Limitation on Restricted Payments; (3)  Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries; (4)  Asset Sales; 30 Table of Contents (5)  Transactions with Affiliates; and (6) clause (c)(iv) under  Mergers or Transfers of Assets. At any time the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the holders of the Notes will be entitled to substantially less, and materially limited, covenant protection. If on any date subsequent to a Covenant Suspension Event (the Reversion Date ) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to as the Suspension Period. On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified as having been Incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph, or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph, under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock below (to the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock would be permitted to be Incurred or issued thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred or issued prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock would not be so permitted to be Incurred or issued pursuant to those provisions, such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (d) of the second paragraph under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Restricted Payments will be made as though the covenant described under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Restricted Payments had been in effect since the Issue Date and throughout the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Restricted Payments. As described above, however, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. For purposes of the covenant described under  Certain Covenants  Asset Sales, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings. Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock The Indenture provides that: (1) the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock; and (2) the Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer or any Guarantor) to issue any shares of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer and any Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and, subject to the third paragraph of this covenant, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), issue shares of Disqualified Stock or issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 1.75 to 1.00 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net cash proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been Incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, 31 Table of Contents as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period. The foregoing limitations do not apply to: (a) (i) Indebtedness under the First Lien Notes issued on the Issue Date, and the guarantees thereof, and (ii) an aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding in the form of any other series of notes representing First Priority Lien Obligations ( other first lien notes ) issued in one or more tranches under the Indenture, and the guarantees by the Guarantors thereof, if on a pro forma basis after giving effect thereto (including a pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Secured Indebtedness Leverage Ratio of the Company would not exceed 2.25 to 1.00; (b) Indebtedness under the Notes outstanding on the Issue Date; (c) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to Credit Facilities, as follows: (i) Indebtedness under any Credit Facilities (other than Asset Backed Credit Facilities) in the aggregate principal amount of $1,500 million plus an aggregate additional principal amount of Indebtedness secured by a Lien outstanding at any one time such that on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the proceeds therefrom) the Secured Indebtedness Leverage Ratio of the Company would not exceed 2.25 to 1.00; provided that the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to this subclause (i) shall be reduced by the amount of any (x) prepayments of term loans under Credit Facilities or (y) permanent reductions of Indebtedness under any revolving credit facility (other than any such prepayments of the ABL Facility), in the case of each of (x) and (y) with the proceeds of an Asset Sale (other than any Asset Sale in respect of Specified ABL Facility Assets); (ii) Indebtedness under Asset Backed Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $2,250 million and (B) the sum of 90% of the net book value of the accounts receivable of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and 70% of the net book value of the inventory of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (the Borrowing Base ) less (x) in the case of the calculation of the Borrowing Base under this subclause (ii) (B), the amount of the Borrowing Base that is the subject of an on balance sheet Qualified Receivables Financing (it being understood that any of the Borrowing Base that is subject to arrangements for disposition or transfer in connection with an off-balance sheet Qualified Receivables Financing shall not be included in the Borrowing Base) and (y) in the case of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred under this subclause (ii)(B), the amount of any Indebtedness Incurred under any Oil Index Credit Facility; provided that any assets or property securing any Project Financing Incurred pursuant to clause (e)(ii) below shall be excluded when determining the Borrowing Base; provided further that Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to this subclause (ii) shall be reduced by the amount of any permanent reductions of Indebtedness under any revolving credit facility (other than any such prepayments of revolving credit facilities Incurred pursuant to clause (c)(i) above) with the proceeds of an Asset Sale (other than any Asset Sale in respect of Specified ABL Facility Assets); provided further that, in the event of an Asset Acquisition, Indebtedness may be Incurred against the Borrowing Base pursuant to the foregoing in anticipation of the completion of such Asset Acquisition on the assumption that the Borrowing Base of the subject of the Asset Acquisition has been acquired; (iii) Indebtedness under any Oil Indexed Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $750.0 million; provided that amounts Incurred pursuant to an Oil Index Credit Facility will be required to reduce the amount of Indebtedness Incurred under the Borrowing Base to the extent Indebtedness in such amount as would no longer be permitted to be Incurred under subclause (ii) above (without duplication for the requirements of subclause (ii) above); (d) Indebtedness existing on the Issue Date (other than the First Lien Notes and Indebtedness described in clauses (b) and (c) above) in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $600.0 million, after giving effect to the consummation of the Reorganization Plan and guarantees of Indebtedness of Joint Ventures outstanding on the Issue Date, and operating leases of the Company and the Restricted 32 Table of Contents Subsidiaries outstanding on the Issue Date to the extent characterized as a Capitalized Lease Obligation after the Issue Date; (e) (i) Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations) Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, Disqualified Stock issued by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and Preferred Stock issued by any Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company to finance (whether prior to or within 270 days after) the acquisition, lease, construction, repair, replacement or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment (whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets); provided that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (e)(i) is not Incurred to finance a Business Acquisition, (ii) Indebtedness Incurred in connection with any Project Financing or (iii) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to a Catalyst Sale/Leaseback Transaction; (f) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries constituting reimbursement Obligations with respect to letters of credit and bank guarantees issued in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, letters of credit in respect of workers compensation claims, health, disability or other benefits to employees or former employees or their families or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance or similar requirements, and letters of credit in connection with the maintenance of, or pursuant to the requirements of, environmental or other permits or licenses from governmental authorities, or other Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement type obligations regarding workers compensation claims; (g) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in each case, Incurred in connection with any acquisition or disposition of any business, assets or a Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, other than guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business, assets or Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition; (h) Indebtedness of the Company to a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (except in respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with the cash management operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) any such Indebtedness owed to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor is subordinated in right of payment to the Obligations of the Company under the Notes; provided further that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary or any pledge of such Indebtedness constituting a Permitted Lien) shall be deemed, in each case, to be an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (h);

Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, amortization of original issue discount, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Future Subsidiary Guarantors The Indenture provides that the Company will cause each (i) Domestic Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Issuer) that is Wholly Owned other than, at the election of the Issuer, an Excluded Subsidiary and (ii) Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Issuer), in each case, that guarantees the First Lien Notes or the Senior Term Loan Facility to execute and deliver to the Trustee (a) a supplemental indenture joining each such Subsidiary of the Company to the Indenture; and (b) Security Documents and intercreditor agreements providing for Junior Lien Obligations, pursuant to which such Subsidiary will 50 Table of Contents guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms and subject to the same conditions and limitations as those described under  The Guarantees and in the Indenture (each such guarantee of the Notes, an Additional Guarantee ). Notwithstanding the foregoing and the other provisions of the Indenture, any Additional Guarantee of the Notes by a Domestic Subsidiary of the Company that is Wholly Owned shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged in the circumstances described under  The Guarantees. Any Additional Guarantee shall be considered a Guarantee as described under  The Guarantees, and any such Domestic Subsidiary of the Company providing such Additional Guarantee shall be considered a Guarantor as described under  The Guarantees. After-Acquired Property Subject to Permitted Liens and the 3-16 Exemption and Excluded Assets limitations, the Indenture provides that, if any of the Company, the Issuer or any Pledgor acquires any First or Second Priority After-Acquired Property, the Company, the Issuer or such Pledgor shall execute and deliver such mortgages, deeds of trust, security instruments, financing statements and certificates and opinions of counsel as shall be reasonably necessary to vest in the Collateral Agent a perfected third priority security interest, subject only to Permitted Liens, in such First or Second Priority After-Acquired Property and to have such First or Second Priority After-Acquired Property added to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such First or Second Priority After-Acquired Property to the same extent and with the same force and effect. In addition, if granting a security interest in such property requires the consent of a third party, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent (i) with respect to the first priority security interest for the benefit of the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the First Lien Notes and for the benefit of the Senior Term Loan Collateral Agent on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Term Loan Facility, (ii) with respect to the second priority security interest for the benefit of the ABL Collateral Agents on behalf of lenders under ABL Facility (or a first priority security interest with respect to the ABL Facility Collateral) and (iii) with respect to the third priority security interest for the benefit of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes. If such third party does not consent to the granting of the first priority security interest after the use of such commercially reasonable efforts, the applicable entity will not be required to provide such first, second and third priority security interests. The Issuer, the Company and the Pledgors will also ensure that third priority security interests are maintained as security for the Notes in any property or assets pledged to secure the First Lien Notes, the Senior Term Loan Facility or the ABL Facility. Mergers or Transfers of Assets The Indenture provides that the Company may not, directly or indirectly, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up or convert into (whether or not the Company is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) the Company is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, winding up or conversion (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, Canada or any province thereof or any state which was a member of the European Union on December 31, 2003 (other than Greece) (the Company or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the Successor Company ); provided that in the case where the surviving Person is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation; (2) the Successor Company (if other than the Company) expressly assumes all the Obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form required by the Indenture and in compliance with the intercreditor agreements; 51 Table of Contents (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an Obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an Obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), either (a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first sentence of the covenant described under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be greater than such ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and (5) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the Indenture. The Successor Company (if other than the Company) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Company under the Indenture and the Notes, and in such event the Company will automatically be released and discharged from its Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this covenant, without complying with the foregoing clause (4), the Company may (A) merge with an Affiliate that has no material assets or liabilities and that is incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Issuer in any state of the U.S., the District of Columbia, Canada or any province thereof or any state which was a member state of the European Union on December 31, 2003 (other than Greece) and (B) may otherwise convert its legal form under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. The Indenture further provides that the Issuer may not, directly or indirectly, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up or convert into (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) the Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, winding up or conversion (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (the Issuer or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the Successor Issuer ); provided that in the case where the surviving Person is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation; (2) the Successor Issuer (if other than the Issuer) expressly assumes all the Obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form required by the Indenture and in compliance with the intercreditor agreements; (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an Obligation of the Successor Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an Obligation of the Successor Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), either (a) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first sentence of the covenant described 52 Table of Contents under  Certain Covenants  Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be greater than such ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and (5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the Indenture. The Successor Issuer (if other than the Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, and in such event the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this covenant, without complying with the foregoing clause (4), the Issuer may (A) merge with an Affiliate that has no material assets or liabilities and that is incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Issuer, as the case may be, in any state of the U.S. or the District of Columbia and (B) may otherwise convert its legal form under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization so long as there remains a corporate co-obligor. This covenant described under  Mergers or Transfers of Assets will not apply to a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the LCC Assumption or the Emergence Transactions. The Indenture further provides that, subject to certain limitations in the Indenture governing release of assets and property securing the Notes upon the sale or disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is a Pledgor, no Pledgor will, and the Company will not permit any Pledgor to, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such Pledgor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person unless: (1) either (a) such Pledgor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger (if other than such Pledgor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (such Pledgor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the Successor Pledgor ) and the Successor Pledgor (if other than such Pledgor) expressly assumes all the Obligations of such Pledgor under the Indenture and the Security Documents pursuant to documents or instruments in form required by the Indenture and in compliance with the intercreditor agreements, or (b) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger is not in violation of the covenant described under  Certain Covenants  Asset Sales; and (2) the Successor Pledgor (if other than such Pledgor) shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Pledgor (if other than such Pledgor) will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Pledgor under the Indenture and such Pledgors Obligations in respect of the Notes, and such Pledgor will automatically be released and discharged from its Obligations under the Indenture and such Pledgors Obligations in respect of the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Pledgor may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing such Pledgor in another state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any territory of the United States so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Pledgor is not increased thereby and (2) a Pledgor may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with another Pledgor or the Company or may convert its legal form under the laws of reorganization of its jurisdiction. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, any Pledgor may consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets (collectively, a Transfer ) to the Company or any Pledgor. 53 Table of Contents Defaults An Event of Default is defined in the Indenture as: (1) a default in any payment of interest (including any additional interest) on any Note when due, continued for 30 days, (2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any Note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise, (3) the failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the Notes or the Indenture, (4) the failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $100.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent (the cross-acceleration provision ), (5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (the bankruptcy provisions ), (6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $100.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts which are covered by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days (the judgment default provision ), (7) the Guarantee of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or the Company denies or disaffirms its Obligations under the Indenture and such Default continues for 10 days, (8) unless all of the Notes Collateral has been released from the third priority Liens in accordance with the provisions of the Security Documents, the third priority Liens on all or substantially all of the Notes Collateral cease to be valid or enforceable and such Default continues for 30 days, or the Company, the Issuer or any Pledgor shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and, in the case of any such Person that is a Subsidiary of the Company, the Company fails to cause such Subsidiary to rescind such assertions within 30 days after the Company has actual knowledge of such assertions, or (9) the failure by the Company, the Issuer or any Pledgor to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the Security Documents except for a failure that would not be material to the holders of the Notes and would not materially affect the value of the Collateral taken as a whole (together with the defaults described in clause (8) the security default provisions ). The foregoing constitutes Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a default under clause (3) or (9) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the default and the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clause (3) or (9) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 54 Table of Contents 30% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuer may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or the Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the Notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity and security against any loss, liability or expense acceptable to the Trustee in its sole discretion. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy, (3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and reasonable indemnity against any loss, liability or expense acceptable to the Trustee in its sole discretion, (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity, and (5) the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and security satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, annually, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after an occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Amendments and Waivers Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture and Security Documents may be amended with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and any past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal 55 Table of Contents amount of the Notes then outstanding. However, without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected, no amendment may, among other things: (1) reduce the amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, (2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note, (3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any Note, (4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed as described under  Redemption  Optional Redemption above, (5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note, (6) expressly subordinate the Notes to any other Indebtedness of the Company, the Issuer or any Pledgor, (7) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such holders Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holders Notes, (8) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holders consent or in the waiver provisions, (9) make any change in the provisions in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture dealing with the application of proceeds of Collateral that would adversely affect the holders of the Notes, or (10) except as expressly provided by the Indenture, modify or release the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary in any manner adverse to the holders of the Notes. Without the consent of the holders of at least 66% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien of the Indenture and the Security Documents with respect to the Notes. Without the consent of any holder, the Issuer, the Guarantors and Trustee may amend the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by a Successor Issuer of the Obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, to provide for the assumption by a Successor Company of the Obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes, to provide for the assumption by a Successor Pledgor of the Obligations of a Pledgor under the Indenture and the Security Documents, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes ( provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), to add a Pledgor with respect to the Notes, to secure the Notes, to release Collateral in compliance with the Indenture or the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to add additional secured creditors holding Other First-Lien Obligations, other Junior Lien Obligations or any other secured Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred, so long as such Obligations are in compliance with the Indenture, the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, to add to the covenants of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder, to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement to any provision of the Description of Third Lien Notes contained in the Plan Supplement filed with the Bankruptcy Court on April 5, 2010 to the extent that such provision in the Description of Third Lien Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, to effect any provision of the Indenture , to make certain changes to the Indenture to provide for the issuance of additional Notes or to provide for the consummation of the LCC Assumption and the Emergency Transactions. 56 Table of Contents The consent of the noteholders will not be necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. After an amendment under the Indenture becomes effective, the Issuer will be required to mail to the respective noteholders a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all noteholders entitled to receive such notice, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment. No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Managers and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, manager, incorporator or holder of any Equity Interests in the Company, the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent corporation, as such, has any liability for any Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such Obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws. Transfer and Exchange A noteholder may transfer or Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the registrar and the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuer may require a noteholder to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Notes to be redeemed. The Notes were issued in registered form and the registered holder of a Note is treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration or transfer or exchange of Notes, as not prohibited by the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when: (1) either (a) all the Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the Notes (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Issuer, are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee funds in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to the date of deposit together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuer directing the Trustee to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be; (2) the Issuer has paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with. Defeasance The Issuer at any time may terminate all its Obligations under the Notes and the Indenture with respect to the holders of the Notes ( legal defeasance ), except for certain Obligations, including those respecting the 57 Table of Contents defeasance trust and Obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Notes. The Issuer at any time may terminate its Obligations under the covenants described under  Certain Covenants for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision described under  Defaults (but only to the extent that those provisions relate to the Defaults with respect to the Notes) and the undertakings and covenants contained under  Change of Control and  Mergers or Transfers of Assets ( covenant defeasance ) for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor will be released from all of its Obligations with respect to the Notes and the Security Documents. The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4) and (5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under  Defaults or because of the failure of the Company to comply with the first clause (4) under  Mergers or Transfers of Assets. In order to exercise its defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the defeasance trust ) with the Trustee money or Government Obligations for the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable Federal income tax law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by the immediately preceding sentence with respect to a legal defeasance need not be delivered if all of the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and payable or (y) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer. Concerning the Trustee and Collateral Agent Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the Trustee under the Indenture, is initially the Collateral Agent under the Indenture and has been appointed by the Issuer as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to the Notes.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Assumed Indemnification Obligations LyondellBasell Industries N.V. assumed certain indemnification obligations for any person who served as a director or officer of any of the Debtors in the Bankruptcy Cases during the period beginning January 6, 2009, subject to certain exceptions. All of our current executive officers and most of our officers will be indemnified pursuant to this assumption under the Plan of Reorganization. Furthermore, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, to the extent that indemnification claims relate to acts or omissions prior to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, any individual covered by the assumed indemnification obligations must first demonstrate that he or she has taken all reasonable actions to obtain payment under any applicable insurance policies, and that the insurers under the policies have disclaimed coverage or have informed such individual that the available limits of liability under the applicable policies have been exhausted. We will only be required to make a payment under the assumed indemnification obligations after the insurance policy has been exhausted or is not otherwise available. With respect to acts or omissions after the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases and prior to the Emergence Date, an insurance policy took effect on December 20, 2007 which covers such acts or omissions. New Indemnification Arrangements Article 26 of Chapter XI of our Articles of Association contains mandatory indemnification provisions for our current and former directors and officers, as well as directors and officers of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, including Lyondell Chemical and the Subsidiary Guarantors, as described generally below. We are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he (or a person or entity for whom he) is or was a member of our Management Board or a member of our Supervisory Board or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company or a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. Our indemnification obligation applies to all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees) II-1 Table of Contents reasonably incurred, except that our indemnification does not apply in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the person is adjudged to be liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his duty to us, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action suit or proceeding was brought or any other court having appropriate jurisdiction determines otherwise. Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending a proceeding may be paid by us in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon a resolution of our Management Board which will have been approved by our Supervisory Board with respect to the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the member of our Management Board, member of our Supervisory Board, director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by us. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our current directors and will enter into similar agreements with executive officers and certain officers and employees of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. We believe that these indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as our directors and executive officers and as officers and employees of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. The SEC has noted, however, that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. We maintain directors and officers liability insurance coverage. Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) provides that a corporation may indemnify any person, including an officer and director, who was or is, or is threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of such cooperation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of such corporation, and, with respect to any criminal actions and proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. A Delaware corporation may indemnify any person, including an officer or director, who was or is, or is threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending or contemplated action or suit by or in the right of such corporation, under the same conditions, except that no indemnification is permitted without judicial approval if such person is adjudged to be liable to such corporation. Where an officer or director of a corporation is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to above, or any claim, issue or matter herein, the corporation must indemnify such person against the expenses (including attorneys fees) which such officer or director actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith. Article VII of Lyondell Chemicals Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Section 5.11 of Lyondell Chemicals Amended and Restated By-Laws provide for indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Section 102 of the DGCL permits a corporation to eliminate the personal liability of its directors or its shareholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except where the director breached his or her duty of loyalty, failed to act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated a law, authorized the payment of a dividend or approved a stock repurchase in violation of Delaware corporate law or obtained an improper personal benefit. Lyondell Chemicals Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that no director of Lyondell Chemical shall be personally liable to Lyondell Chemical or its shareholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability, except to the extent that the DGCL prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty II-2 Table of Contents ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES On April 30, 2010, we issued 563,901,979 shares in exchange for bankruptcy claims and in connection with a rights offering. We also issued warrants to purchase 11,508,204 shares with an exercise price of $15.90 per share and issued 1,771,794 shares of restricted stock to our Chief Executive Officer as compensation. These issuances, as well as the issuance of shares upon exercise of the warrants, were exempt from registration requirements under the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 1145 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and exempt from any state or local law requiring registration for offer or sale of a security or registration or licensing of an issuer of, underwriter of, or broker dealer in, a security. Additionally, up to 22,000,000 shares are authorized for issuance to certain senior management and members of the Supervisory Board of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. and its subsidiaries, pursuant to our incentive plans. Pursuant to LyondellBasell Industries N.V.s LTIP, effective as the Emergence Date, in addition to the restricted stock issued to Mr. Gallogly, we issued 8,200,130 options to purchase our shares at an exercise price of $17.61 and 1,713,513 restricted stock units, which entitle the recipients thereof to receive shares upon vesting. These restricted share units vest in full five years after the date of grant of April 30, 2010. The LTIP issuances were deemed not to require registration under the so-called no-sale theory, or were otherwise exempt from registration requirements under Section 4(2) and Rule 701 of the Securities Act, related to securities issued not involving a public offering and pursuant to compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation.

UNDERTAKINGS The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) to file, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to: (a) include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (b) reflect in the prospectus any facts or events after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (c) include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (5) insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
