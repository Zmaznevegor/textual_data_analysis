There is no current market for the securities. Although the registrants common stock has a par value of $0.001, the registrant believes that the calculations offered pursuant to Rule 457(f)(2) are not applicable and, as such, the registrant has valued the common stock in good faith and for the purposes of the registration fee, based on $0.03 per share. In the event of a stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction involving our common stock, the number of shares registered shall automatically be increased to cover the additional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to Rule 416 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. REGISTRANT HEREBY AMENDS THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON DATES AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO DELAY ITS EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL THE REGISTRANT SHALL FILE A FURTHER AMENDMENT WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT SHALL THEREAFTER BECOME EFFECTIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8(a) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, OR UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON DATES AS THE COMMISSION, ACTING UNDER SAID SECTION 8(a), MAY DETERMINE . 2 Prospectus THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT COMPLETE AND MAY BE CHANGED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED. BENACO, INC 3,000,000 Shares of Common Stock $0.03 per share This is the initial offering of common stock of Benaco, Inc. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. A public market may never develop for the securities being offered, or, if a market develops, may not be sustained. We are offering on a best-effort basis 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.03 per share in a direct public offering, without any involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers. The offering does not require that we sell a minimum number of shares; therefore not all of the shares may be sold. The amount raised may be minimal and there is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient amount to cover our expenses and may not even cover the costs of the offering. This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. Ms. Belykh will sell the shares and intends to offer them to friends, family members and business acquaintances. In offering the securities on our behalf, she will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.03 per share for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days from the effective date of this prospectus, unless extended by our board of directors for an additional 90 days. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the date when Benaco, Inc. decides to do so, or (ii) when the offering is fully subscribed for. Benaco, Inc. is a development stage company and currently has limited operation. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully read and consider the section of this prospectus entitled Risk Factors on page 6 through 11 before buying any shares of Benaco, Inc.s common stocks. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for Benaco, Inc. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have not made any arrangements to place funds in an escrow, trust or similar account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws. If a creditor sues us and obtains a judgment against us, the creditor could garnish the bank account and take possession of the subscriptions. As such, it is possible that a creditor could attach your subscription which could preclude or delay the return of money to you. If that happens, you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay the creditors. NEITHER THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY AS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, WE, US, OUR, AND BENACO, INC. REFERS TO BENACO, INC. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS NOT COMPLETE AND DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. BENACO, INC. We are a development stage company. We were incorporated on November 18, 2010, under the laws of the State of Nevada, and intend to commence operations in the distribution of Bohemian Crystal Chandeliers. We are a company without revenues and have limited operations; we have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. Our financial statements for the period from November 18, 2010 (date of inception) to February 28, 2011, report no revenues and a net loss of $499. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for Benaco, Inc. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, the only operations we have engaged in are the development of a business plan and the execution of a Sales Distribution Agreement with Hascrone S.R.O, a private Czech company on March 2, 2011. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with your business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum funding of approximately $30,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a minimum period of one year. Even if we raise $30,000 from this offering or more, we may need more funds to develop growth strategy and to continue maintaining a reporting status; therefore we will have to obtain financing to complete our twelve month business plan. Our principal office is located at K Cervenemu Vrchu 845/2b, Apt. 223, Prague 6, Czech Republic 160 00. Our telephone number is 011-420-77777-2181; fax number is 011- 420-22720-4956. Our fiscal year end is February 28. As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop. THE OFFERING The Issuer: Benaco, Inc. Securities Being Offered: 3,000,000 shares of common stock Price Per Share: $0.03 Duration of the Offering: The shares will be offered for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days from the effective date of this prospectus, unless extended by our board of directors for an additional 90 days. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the date when the sale of all 3,000,000 shares is completed, (ii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 3,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part.

Risk Factors See Risk Factors and other information in this prospectus for a discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. Address: K Červenemu Vrchu 845/2b, Apt. 223, Prague 6, Czech Republic 160 00 Telephone Number: 011-420-77777-2181 5 Selected financial data The following financial information summarizes the more complete historical financial information at the end of this prospectus. As of February 28, 2011 Balance Sheet Total Assets $ 4,000 Total Liabilities $ 499 Stockholders Equity $ 3,501 Period from November 18, 2010 (date of inception) to February 28, 2011 Income Statement Revenue $ - Total Expenses $ 499 Net Loss $ (499) RISK FACTORS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A TRADING PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. IF AND WHEN OUR COMMON STOCK BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR TRADING ON THE OVER-THE-COUNTER BULLETIN BOARD, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT We are a new company with no operating history and we face a high risk of business failure which would result in the loss of your investment. We are a development stage company formed recently to carry out the activities described in this prospectus and thus have only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of its prospectus can be made. We were incorporated on November 18, 2010 and to date have been involved primarily in the development of our business plan. We have limited business operations. Thus, there is no internal or industry-based historical financial data upon which to estimate our planned operating expenses. We expect that our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of market factors including, among others, the entry of new competitors offering a similar product; the initiation, renewal or expiration of our customer base; pricing changes by the Company or its competitors, specific economic conditions in the construction and home renovation market, and general economic conditions. Accordingly, our future sales and operating results are difficult to forecast. As of the date of this prospectus, we have earned no revenue. Failure to generate revenue will cause us to go out of business, which could result in the complete loss of your investment. Because our auditors have raised a going concern opinion, there is substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment. 6 Without the funding from this offering we will be unable to implement our business plan. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations in distribution of Bohemian Crystal Chandeliers. We will need the funds from this offering to commence activities that will allow us to begin seeking financing of our business plan. As of February 28, 2011, we had total assets in the amount of $4,000 and liabilities of $499. As of this date, we have had limited operations and no income. We are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business, the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues. We may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available . We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations. Our offering has no minimum structure. Specifically, there is no minimum number of shares that needs to be sold in this offering for us to access the funds. Given that the offering is a best effort, self-underwritten offering, we cannot assure you that all or any shares will be sold. We have no firm commitment from anyone to purchase all or any of the shares offered. We may need additional funds to complete further development of our business plan to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. There is substantial doubt as to whether we will continue operations. If we discontinue operations, you could lose your investment. We were incorporated on November 18, 2010. Our net loss since inception is $ 499. Our business prospects are difficult to predict because of our limited operating history, early stage of development, and unproven business strategy. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the ability of our business to continue as a going concern. We anticipate that we will incur increased expenses without realizing enough revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to find customers for our products in the North American market. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in finding customers and in generating revenues and profit in the future. Failure to generate revenues and profit will cause us to suspend or cease operations. If this happens, you could lose all or part of your investment. Because our sole officer and director has other business interests, she may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations, causing our business to fail. Our sole Chief Executive Officer and director, Ms. Natalia Belykh, will only be devoting limited time to our operations. Ms. Belykh intends to devote approximately 10 hours/week of her business time to our affairs. Because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to her. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations. It is possible that the demands on Natalia Belykh from her other obligations could increase with the result that she would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. In addition, Ms. Belykh may not possess sufficient time for our business if the demands of managing our business increase substantially beyond current levels. If we are unable to retain key personnel, then we may not be able to implement our business plan. We depend on the services of our sole officer and director, Natalia Belykh, for the future success of our. The loss of the services of Ms. Belykh could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not carry any key personnel life insurance policies on Ms. Belykh and we do not have a contract for her services. 7 Because our sole officer and director will own 57.14% or more of our outstanding common stock, she will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders . If maximum offering shares will be sold, Ms. Belykh, our sole officer and director, will own 57.14% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, she will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Ms. Belykh may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. Because companys headquarters are located outside of the United States, U.S. Investors may experience difficulties in attempting to affect service of process and to enforce judgments based upon U.S. Federal Securities Laws against the company and its non U.S. Resident officer and director. While we are organized under the laws of State of Nevada, Natalia Belykh, our sole officer and director is a non-U.S. resident, and our headquarters are located outside of the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process on her in the United States and to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in United States courts against her based on the civil liability provisions of the United States securities laws. Since all our assets will be located in Czech Republic it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. investors to collect a judgment against us. As well, any judgment obtained in the United States against us may not be enforceable in the United States. All our products will be purchased from one supplier. If that supplier decreased or terminated its relationship with us, our business would likely fail if we are unable to find a substitute for that company. As a result of being totally dependent on a single wholesale supplier located in Czech Republic, we may be subject to certain risks, including changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers, increased pressure, timing and availability of export licenses, the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and treaties, and uncertainties relative to regional, political and economic circumstances. We purchase our products from Hascrone S.R.O, a private Czech company. Our agreement with this company does not prevent it from supplying its Bohemian crystal chandeliers to our competitors or directly to consumers. If this company decreased, modified or terminated its association with us for any other reason, we would suffer an interruption in our business unless and until we found a substitute for that supplier. If we were unable to find a substitute for that supplier, our business would likely fail. We cannot predict what the likelihood would be of finding an acceptable substitute supplier. We face intense competition for our products and as a result, we may be unable to compete in the market of crystal chandeliers distribution. The market for crystal chandeliers is highly competitive and fragmented. The Company expects competition to intensify in the future. We compete in each of our markets with numerous national, regional and local companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, managerial and other resources that are presently not available to us. Numerous well-established companies are focusing significant resources on providing different kind of chandeliers that will compete with our products. No assurance can be given that we will be able to effectively compete with these other companies or that competitive pressures, including possible downward pressure on the prices we charge for our products, will not rise. In the event that we cannot effectively compete on a continuing basis or competitive pressures arise, such inability to compete or competitive pressures will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 8 Our success depends on third party distribution channels. We intend to sell our product ourselves and through a series of resellers and distributors. Our future revenue growth will depend in large part on sales of our product through these relationships. We may not be successful in developing distribution relationships. Entities that distribute our product may compete with us. In addition, these distributors may not dedicate sufficient resources or give sufficient priority to selling our product. Our failure to develop distribution channels, the loss of a distribution relationship, or a decline in the efforts of a material reseller or distributor could prevent us from generating sufficient revenues to become profitable. The industry in which we compete is highly cyclical and recent downturn in new residential and commercial and home improvement activity results in lower demand on home accessories that could have materially adverse impact on our financial results. The building material and home accessories distribution industry is subject to cyclical market pressures caused by a number of factors that are out of our control, such as general economic and political conditions, levels of new construction, home and office improvement and remodeling activity, interest rates, weather and population growth. We are most impacted by changes in the demand for new homes and commercial real estate as well as renovations and in general economic conditions that impact the level of home and office improvements. Changes in market demand for new homes and commercial real estate as well as for home and office improvements occur periodically and vary in severity. Because of the latest subprime mortgage crisis and current recession there was severe downturn in economy and construction industry. There is no assurance that our industry will recover in the near future and will grow. Price competition could negatively affect our gross margins. Price competition could negatively affect our operating results. To respond to competitive pricing pressures, we will have to offer our products at lower prices in order to retain or gain market share and customers. If our competitors offer discounts on certain products in the future, we will need to lower prices to match the competition, which could adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. Changes in economic conditions that impact consumer spending could harm our business. Our financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, particularly home renovation and improvement spending. Future economic conditions affecting consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other products. A general reduction in the level of consumer spending or shifts in consumer spending to other products could have a material adverse effect on our growth, sales and profitability. Because we will distribute our products from overseas, a disruption in the delivery of imported products may have a greater effect on us than on our competitors. We will import our product from Czech Republic. Because we import our product and deliver it directly to our customers, we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who manufacture and/or warehouse products in the United States or Canada. Deliveries of our products may be disrupted through factors such as: (1) raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political unrest; (2) problems with ocean shipping, including work stoppages and shipping container shortages; (3) increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments; and (4) economic crises, international disputes and wars. Most of our competitors warehouse products they import from overseas, which allows them to continue delivering their products for the near term, despite overseas shipping disruptions. If our competitors are able to deliver products when we cannot, our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers to our competitors. 9 Our business could be harmed if we are sold damaged or misrepresented merchandise by our supplier. We plan on purchasing products only from reliable and established suppliers with excellent reputation. However, we are a development stage corporation and just recently started operations, we do not have pre-established relationships with our supplier and might bear the risk of being sold damaged or misrepresented products. If we are not able to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. We may in the future issue additional shares of common stock, which would reduce investors percentage of ownership and may dilute our share value. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 4,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding. The future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. We arbitrarily determined the price of the shares of our common stock to be sold pursuant to this prospectus, and such price does not reflect the actual market price for the securities. Consequently, there is an increased risk that you may not be able to re-sell our common stock at the price you bought it for. The initial offering price of $0.03 per share of the common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus was determined by us arbitrarily. The price is not based on our financial condition or prospects, on the market prices of securities of comparable publicly traded companies, on financial and operating information of companies engaged in similar activities to ours, or on general conditions of the securities market. The price may not be indicative of the market price, if any, for our common stock in the trading market after this Offering. If the market price for our stock drops below the price which you paid, you may not be able to re-sell out common stock at the price you bought it for. Our common stock may never be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. When/if our shares of common stock commence trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, the trading price will fluctuate significantly and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares. As of the date of this Registration Statement, our common stock does not yet trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Our common stock may never be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. When/if our shares of common stock commence trading on the Bulletin Board, there is a volatility associated with Bulletin Board securities in general and the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock: (i) disappointing results from our development efforts; (ii) failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget; (iii) decline in demand for our common stock; (iv) downward revisions in securities analysts' estimates or changes in general market conditions; (v) technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies; (vi) lack of funding generated for operations; (vii) investor perception of our industry or our prospects; and (viii) general economic trends. In addition, stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile. These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors may be unable to sell their shares at a fair price and you may lose all or part of your investment. 10 Our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the trading market in our securities will be limited, which will make transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock market. A broker-dealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer, and sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for stock that becomes subject to those penny stock rules. If a trading market for our common stock develops, our common stock will probably become subject to the penny stock rules, and shareholders may have difficulty in selling their shares. There is no current trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop, purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their shares. There is currently no established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. We intend to have a market maker apply for admission to quotation of our securities on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board after the Registration Statement relating to this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. If for any reason our common stock is not quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or a public trading market does not otherwise develop, purchasers of the share may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so. No market makers have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so. We will incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance, making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all. Our business plan allows for the payment of the estimated $10,000 cost of this registration statement to be paid from existing cash on hand and loans from our sole officer and director, Natalia Belykh. Ms. Natalia Belykh, our Chairman, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process; however, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement and there is no assurance that additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. 11 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.03. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 33.33%, 66.67% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company.

The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. DILUTION OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. As of February 28, 2011, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was $3,501 or approximately $0.0009 per share based upon 4,000,000 shares outstanding. If 100% of the Shares Are Sold: Upon completion of this offering, in the event all of the shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 7,000,000 shares then outstanding will be $83,501 or approximately $0.0119 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0109 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.03 per share to $0.0119 per share. After completion of this offering, if 3,000,000 shares are sold, investors in the offering will own approximately 42.86% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $90,000, or $0.03 per share. Our existing stockholders will own approximately 57.14% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totaling $4,000.00 or $0.001 per share. If Two-Third of the Shares Are Sold Upon completion of this offering, in the event 2,000,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 6,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $53,501, or approximately $0.0089 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0079 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.03 per share to $0.0089 per share. After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own approximately 33.33% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $60,000, or $0.03 per share. Our existing stockholders will own approximately 66.66% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totaling $4,000.00 or $0.001 per share. If One-Third of the Shares Are Sold Upon completion of this offering, in the event 1,000,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 5,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $23,501, or approximately $0.0047 per share. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0037 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.03 per share to $0.0047 per share. After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own 20% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $30,000, or $0.03 per share. Our existing stockholders will own 80% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which they have made contributions of cash totaling $4,000.00 or $0.001 per share. 13 The following table compares the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders. Existing Stockholders if all of the Shares are Sold: Price per share $ 0.001 Net tangible book value per share before offering $ 0.0009 Potential gain to existing shareholders $ 80,000 Net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0119 Increase to present stockholders in net tangible book value per share after offering $ 0.0109 Capital contributions $ 4,000 Number of shares outstanding before the offering 4,000,000 Number of shares after offering assuming the sale of the maximum number of shares 7,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 57.14 % Purchasers of Shares in this Offering if all Shares Sold Price per share $ 0.03 Dilution per share $ 0.0181 Capital contributions $ 90,000 Number of shares after offering held by public investors 3,000,000 Percentage of capital contributions by existing shareholders 4.26 % Percentage of capital contributions by new investors 95.76 % Percentage of ownership after offering 42.86 % Purchasers of Shares in this Offering if Two-third of Shares Sold Price per share $ 0.03 Dilution per share $ 0.0211 Capital contributions $ 60,000 Number of shares after offering held by public investors 2,000,000 Percentage of capital contributions by existing shareholders 6.25 % Percentage of capital contributions by new investors 93.75 % Percentage of ownership after offering 33.33 % Purchasers of Shares in this Offering One-third of Shares Sold Price per share $ 0.03 Dilution per share $ 0.0253 Capital contributions $ 30,000 Percentage of capital contributions by existing shareholders 11.76 % Percentage of capital contributions by new investors 88.24 % Number of shares after offering held by public investors 1,000,000 Percentage of ownership after offering 20 % 14 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION; TERMS OF THE OFFERING Benaco, Inc. has 4,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION This section of the prospectus includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. We are a development stage corporation and only recently started our operations. We have not generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. Our cash balance is $4,000 as of February 28, 2011. Our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months and to qualify our minimum cash requirements necessary to fund 12 months of operations, if we are unable to successfully raise money in this offering. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Natalia Belykh, our Chairman, President, and Secretary, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. Ms. Belykh, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to achieve our business plan goals, we will need the funding from this offering and substantial additional funding. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues. We do not expect to have revenues until at least eight months after this prospectus becomes effective. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by shareholders in our company. We must raise cash to implement our projected plan of operations. If we sell 50% of the securities offered for sale by the Company, the proceeds will satisfy cash requirements for 12 months and we will not be required to raise additional funds to meet operating expenses but our growth strategy will be limited. If we sell more than half of the shares in this offering, we believe the money will last for more than a year, and also provide funds for growth strategy. If we need more money we will have to revert to obtaining additional financing as described in this paragraph. If we are unable to successfully find enough customers to buy our products we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. 16 We plan to raise additional funding for development by way of a private debt or equity financing, but have not commenced any activities to raise such funds and have no current plans on how to raise such funds. If we experience such a shortage of funds prior to funding during the next 12 months, we may utilize funds from Natalia Belykh, our Sole Officer and Director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses, however she has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans. No proceeds will be used as direct or indirect payments to Ms. Belykh or her affiliates. Plan of Operation Our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months, if we are unable to successfully raise money in this offering. However, if we sell half of the securities offered for sale by the Company and raise the gross proceeds of $45,000, the net proceeds of $35,000 will satisfy cash requirements for 12 months and we will not be required to raise additional funds to meet operating expenses, but our growth strategy will be limited. If we sell more than half of the shares in this offering, we believe the money will last for more than a year, and also provide funds for growth strategy. If we need more money we will have to revert to obtaining additional financing by way of a private debt or equity financing. We may also utilize funds from Ms. Natalia Belykh, our Sole Officer and Director. Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. We will not be conducting any product research or development. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. Our plan of operations is as follows: Complete our public offering We expect to complete our public offering within 180 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. In the twelve months, following completion of our public offering we plan to do the following activities to expand our business operations. Establish our office. Time Frame: 1 st -2 nd months. Estimated cost $2,500 . Upon completion of the offering we plan to set up office in Czech Republic and acquire the necessary equipment to begin operations. We believe that it will cost at least $2,500 to set up office and obtain the necessary equipment to begin operations. Our sole officer and director will handle our administrative duties. Office requirements: Print/Scan/Fax $ 500 PC and Software $ 800 Furnishings $ 600 Phone $ 200 Misc $ 500 17 Develop our website. Time Frame: 2 nd - 5 th months. Estimated Cost $2,500. During this period, we intend to begin developing our website. Our sole officer and director, Natalia Belykh will be in charge of registering our web domain. Once we register our web domain, we plan to hire a web designer to help us with the design and develop our website. We do not have any written agreements with any web designers at current time. The website development costs, including site design and implementation will be approximately $2,500. Updating and improving our website will continue throughout the lifetime of our operations. Contact shipping companies. Time Frame: 3 rd - 5 th months. No material costs. While we develop our website, we will contact well-known shipping companies to research the shipping costs from Czech Republic to the USA and Canada. Shipping costs will be added automatically to customers final bills. It will work for both our retail customers, purchasing Bohemian crystal chandeliers from our website and for wholesale customers. Commence marketing campaign. Time Frame: 5 th -12 th months. Estimated cost $12,000. Once our website is operational we will start our marketing campaign. We intend to develop and maintain a database of potential customers who may want to purchase Bohemian crystal chandeliers from us. We will follow up with these clients periodically, send them our new catalogues and offer them presentations and special discounts from time to time. We plan to print catalogues and flyers and mail them to potential customers. We intend to use marketing strategies, such as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We also expect to get new clients from "word of mouth" advertising where our clients will refer their colleagues to us. We will encourage such advertising by rewarding those people who referred new clients to us. We also plan to attend shows and exhibitions in our industry. We intend to spend at least $12,000 on marketing efforts during the first year. Marketing is an ongoing matter that will continue during the life of our operations. Negotiate agreements with our potential wholesale customers. Time Frame: 5 th -12 th months. At the same time as we start our marketing campaign and our website is operational, we will begin to negotiate agreements with our potential wholesale customers. Initially, our sole officer and director, Ms. Belykh, will look for potential customers. Even though the negotiation of additional agreements with potential customers will be ongoing during the life of our operations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find successful agreements, in which case our business may fail and we will have to cease our operations. Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of agreements at the end of the twelve month period, there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. Hire a salesperson. Time Frame: 10 th -12 th months. Estimated cost $12,000-15,000. If we sell at least two-third of the shares in this offering, we intend to hire one salesperson with experience and established network in the wholesale and retail market. The salespersons job would be to find new potential customers, and to execute agreements with them to buy our Bohemian crystal chandeliers. We therefore expect to incur the following costs in the next 12 months in connection with our business operations and SEC filing requirements: Office Set Up $2,500 Marketing costs $12,000 Website development costs $2,500 Legal and Professional fees $10,000 Other expenses $3,000 Total $30,000 The funds under Other Expenses from Use of Proceeds will remain in our bank account and will be spent on any unplanned costs and expenses. 18 In summary, we should be in full operation and selling our service within 12 months of completing our offering. Until we start to sell our products, we do not believe that our operations will be profitable. If we are unable to find customers we may have to suspend or cease operations. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to continue operations, we will suspend or cease operations. If we cease operations we likely will dissolve and file for bankruptcy and shareholders would lose their entire investment in our company. Natalia Belykh, our president will be devoting approximately 25% (10 hours/week) of her time to our operations. Once we expand operations, and are able to attract more and more customers to buy our product, Ms. Belykh has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Ms. Belykh will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations. Limited operating history; need for additional capital There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Results of operations From Inception on November 18, 2010 to February 28, 2011 During the period we incorporated the company, and prepared a business plan . Our loss since inception is $499. We have not started our proposed business operations and will not do so until we have completed this offering. We expect to begin operations within 12 months after we complete this offering. Liquidity and capital resources As of February 28, 2011, the Company had $4,000 cash and our liabilities were $499, comprising $499 owed to Natalia Belykh, our sole officer and director. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. Since inception, we have sold 4,000,000 shares of common stock in one offer and sale, which was to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $4,000. To meet a small part of our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise the necessary funds to proceed with all phases of our plan of operation. The sources of funding we may consider to fund this work is a private placement of our securities or loans from our director or others. As of the date of this registration statement, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status. The companys sole officer and director, Natalia Belykh, has indicated that he may be willing to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company; however, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety. 19 Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting company. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000. Management believes that if subsequent private offerings of our equity or debt securities generate sufficient funds so that we can complete our development program, we will likely generate revenue by the end of 2012. However, such additional equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities, as described herein. Therefore, the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible for the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a development stage company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities, or secure a loan, the Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors would lose all of their investment. Management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Companys success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations. Should the Company fail to sell less than half of its shares under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abort completely the implementation of its 12-month plan of operation. BUSINESS General We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010. We just recently started our operations. We intend to distribute Czech Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the USA and Canada. We have not generated any revenues and the only operation we have engaged in is the development of a business plan and execution of the Sales Distribution Agreement with Hascrone S.R.O on March 2, 2011. We maintain our statutory registered agent's office at 2360 Corporate Circle, Suite 400, Henderson, Nevada 89074-7722. Our business office is located at K Červenemu Vrchu 845/2b, Apt. 223, Prague 6, Czech Republic 160 00. Our telephone number is 011-420-77777-2181, our fax number is 011- 420-22720-4956. We need proceeds from this offering to start our 12 months plan of operation. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever begin operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and will have to cease operations due to the lack of funding. Our working capital as at February 28, 2011 was $4,000. The total estimated amount of funds required to develop our business is $30,000. We need funds for general administrative expenses, business development, marketing costs, support materials and costs associated with being a publicly reporting company. We have not generated any revenue from operations to date. In order to expand our business operations, we anticipate that we will have to raise additional funding. The most likely source of future funds available to us is through the sale of additional shares of common stock or advances from our sole director Ms. Belykh, though we do not have an agreement from Ms. Belykh for such cash advances. 20 Our business is the distribution of Bohemian crystal chandeliers produced in Czech Republic. We will distribute our chandeliers in the North American market to both retail and wholesale customers. Our products will be offered at prices marked-up from 20% to 30% of our purchase price to retail customers and 15% of our purchased price to wholesale customers. We plan to accept retail orders on-line only. Orders made by our wholesale customers will be also accepted by email, phone and fax. We do not intend to offer any credit terms relating to order payments. Our customers will be asked to 100% prepay for the products. Customers will have three options to pay for our products: by credit card, by wire transfer or by sending a check/money order. If customer decides to pay by check/money order, then we will apply a certain amount of days before shipping to have the check/money order cleared. Customers will be responsible to cover the shipping costs. Shipping costs will be added automatically to a customers final bill. It will work for both retail and wholesale customers purchasing our Bohemian crystal chandeliers. We do not intend to store inventory for any period of time. The orders will be shipped to the customers depending on customers requests. Customers will be responsible for the custom duties, taxes or any other additional charges that might incur. All shipments will be 100% insured for the value of the shipping, insurance cost will be customers responsibility. To avoid potential issues associated with non-familiarity of Czech Republic chandelier market and language barrier, time difference, and finally time and effort involved in finding reliable Bohemian crystal chandelier suppliers, we expect North American customers to purchase chandeliers from us rather than directly from chandelier distributers in Czech Republic. Product Overview Bohemia crystal is a decorative glass produced in regions of Bohemia and Silesia, now in the current state of the Czech Republic, since the 13th century. Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the Lusatian Mountains of Northern Bohemia. Bohemia was a part of the former Czechoslovakia, now part of the Czech Republic, and was famous for its beautiful and colorful glass. The history of Bohemian glass started with the abundant natural resources found in the countryside. Bohemian glass-workers discovered potash combined with chalk created a clear colorless glass that was more stable than glass from Italy. It was at that time when the term Bohemian crystal emerged for the first time in history to distinguish its qualities from the glass coming from other places. For a long period of time, Bohemian crystal has been a synonym of beauty and perfect quality processing. It was in the chandelier that crystal found its natural expression. At the beginning of the 18th century, Bohemian crystal chandeliers became a popular article and influential rulers started to decorate their palaces by these precious chandeliers. Even nowadays, at the beginning of the 21st century, crystal chandeliers are still made by small Czech family enterprises using the same processing methods, emphasizing the quality and the unique quality of workmanship. The art of glass cutting was born in Prague in the 1500's immediately following the establishment of a diamond cutting workshop. A local cutter began using the diamond tools to engrave mouth blown glass, unleashing a revolution in the decoration of glass and crystal. By the beginning of the 17th century, Bohemian glassmakers were manufacturing glass mass closely resembling natural crystal. That is why it was later named Bohemian crystal and became highly prized for its limpidity. From the 1700's to the early 1920's Bohemian Crystal surpassed the popularity of other European nations as the most sought after glass products in the world. Our Products There is a certain difference between glass and crystal, which, however, changes from country to country or region to region. In most western countries, the word crystal stands for the presence of lead. According to the rules of the European Community, glass goods containing more than 4 per cent of lead monoxide is defined as glass. Glass goods containing more than 10 per cent of lead monoxide is deemed crystal, and finally, glass goods containing over 30 per cent of lead monoxide are classified as lead crystal. In the U.S., 1 per cent of lead is enough for a glass to be classified as crystal (1). In Bohemia (the Czech Republic), such classification is a matter of interpretation and the term crystalcan be used for any refined, high-quality glass. (1) http://quazen.com/shopping/home-and-garden/difference-between-crystal-and-glass/ 21 Our mission is to provide customers with the finest hand crafted Bohemian crystal chandeliers at the competitive prices. Our supplier agreed to supply us with many kinds of Bohemian crystal chandeliers from different manufactures in Czech Republic. Our supplier also agreed to take special orders to manufacture chandeliers according to a customers design. All our Bohemian crystal chandeliers come with a manufacturers warranty and are guaranteed against any factory defects. We plan on purchasing products only from reliable and established suppliers with excellent reputation. However, we are a development stage corporation, we do not have pre-established relationships with our supplier and might bear the risk of being sold damaged or misrepresented products. If we are not able to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. To minimize problems associated with the purchase of damaged or misrepresented products only suppliers providing a 30 day full-money-refund return policy (which entitles the consumer to return the goods within that period for a full money refund) will be used by us to purchase merchandise. However, rectification of the above mentioned problems as well shipping time needed to return damaged or misrepresented merchandise to a supplier can be time consuming, which may negatively affect our operating results. Potential customers Our target market includes retail customers willing to purchase Bohemian crystal chandeliers from our website, potential customers with significant special orders and wholesale customers. Our President and sole director, Ms. Natalia Belykh will market our products and negotiate special individual orders and agreements with wholesale potential customers. We intend to develop and maintain a database of potential customers who may want to purchase Bohemian crystal chandeliers from us. We will follow up with these clients periodically and offer them free samples, presentations and special discounts from time to time. We plan to attend trade shows in our industry to showcase our product with a view to find new customers. We will ask our satisfied customers for referrals. If we sell more than two-third of the shares in this offering, we plan to hire a sales representative. The salespersons job will be to find new potential customers for big special orders as well as wholesale customers, and execute agreements with them to buy our Bohemian crystal chandeliers. We expect that our potential clients will consist of the following: 1. Retail customers purchasing our chandeliers on-line for themselves; 2. Lighting stores and distributors selling all kinds of chandeliers; contractors, homebuilders and developers; 3. Other on-line stores selling crystal chandeliers; 4. When/if we start to earn enough revenue to develop our business we will negotiate agreements to sell our products in big department stores and retail outlets such as home renovation stores; 5. Special orders from clients such as theaters, opera houses, concert halls, hotels, casinos, government buildings, art centers, museums and so on. Competition Winning customers will be critical to our ability to grow our business. Failing to obtain orders for our products from potential customers, for competitive reasons or otherwise, would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The crystal chandelier distribution market is extremely fragmented and competitive. Competitors will include companies with substantial customer bases and working history. There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing, service and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 22 Some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows: 1. Number of Competitors Increase: other companies may follow our business model of distributing lower priced Bohemian crystal chandeliers, which will reduce our competitive edge. 2. Price: Our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell our product at loss. 3. Substitute Products: Bohemian crystal chandeliers may be substituted by similar product such as glass, crystal, plastic chandeliers; Swarovski or contemporary chandeliers. Consumer preferences for Bohemian crystal chandeliers may change overtime which may affect our business positively or negatively depending on whether Bohemian crystal chandeliers is preferred more or less. Marketing Our Products Our sole officer and director, Natalia Belykh, will be responsible for marketing of our services and product. We intend to develop and maintain a database of potential customers who may want to purchase Bohemian crystal chandeliers from us. We will follow up with these clients periodically, send them our new catalogues and offer them presentations and special discounts from time to time. We plan to print catalogues and flyers and mail them to potential customers. We intend to use marketing strategies, such as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We also expect to get new clients from "word of mouth" advertising where our clients will refer their colleagues to us. We will encourage such advertising by rewarding those people who referred new clients to us. We also plan to attend shows and exhibitions in our industry. If we sell more than two-third of the shares offered, we plan to hire additional sales personnel to help advertise and sell our products. Website Marketing Strategy We plan to develop a website to market and display our products. To accomplish this, we plan to contract an independent web designing company. Our website will describe our products in detail, show our contact information, and include some general information and pictures of Bohemian crystal chandeliers. We will market and advertise our product on our web site by showing its advantages. We intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics such as registering with top search engines using selected key words (meta tags) and utilizing link and banner exchange options. We intend to promote our website by displaying it on our promotion materials. To enhance our sales and to advertise our product we plan to keep improving and developing our website to make it as user friendly as possible. Our website will offer a large array of Bohemian crystal chandeliers and by becoming a "one-stop shopping" destination will significantly enhance the efficiency of the purchasing process simultaneously reducing the time and cost of finding reasonably priced Bohemian crystal chandeliers. Our online store will provide customers with an easy-to-use shopping alternative. The website will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week allowing customers to shop for our products directly from their home or office. We will attempt to provide a customer service department via email where consumers can resolve order and product questions. Agreement with our supplier On March 2, 2011 we signed a Sales Distribution Agreement with Hascrone S.R.O, a private company from Czech Republic. Hascrone S.R.O specializes in distribution of broad variety of Bohemian chandeliers in Czech Republic and abroad. The agreement with Hascrone S.R.O contains the following material terms: 4.

A copy of the Sales Distribution Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this registration statement. 23 Natalia Belykh, our president will be devoting approximately 25% (10 hours per week) of her time to our operations. Once we begin operations, and are able to attract more and more customers to use our service, Ms. Belykh has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Ms. Belykh will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to her. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations. Description of property We do not have an ownership or leasehold interest in any property. Insurance We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. Director Independence Our board of directors is currently composed of one member, Natalia Belykh, who does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees. We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director Natalia Belykh.

We do not have an audit committee financial expert because we believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because we have no operations, at the present time, we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted. Conflicts of Interest The only conflict that we foresee are that our sole officer and director will devote time to projects that do not involve us.

We will provide audited financial statements to our stockholders on a quarterly basis; the statements will be audited by a firm of Certified Public Accountants. Our financial statements from inception (November 18, 2010) to February 28, 2011 immediately follow: INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-1 Financial Statements F-2 Balance Sheet  February 28, 2011 F-2 Statement of Operations  Inception (November 18, 2010) through February 28, 2011 F-3 Statement of Stockholders Equity (Deficit)  Inception (November 18, 2010) through February 28, 2011 F-4 Statement of Cash Flows  Inception (November 18, 2010) through February 28, 2011 F-5 Notes to Financial Statements F-6 30 RONALD R. CHADWICK, P.C. Certified Public Accountant 2851 South Parker Road, Suite 720 Aurora, Colorado 80014 Telephone (303)306-1967 Fax (303)306-1944 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors Benaco, Inc. Henderson, Nevada I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Benaco, Inc. (a development stage company) as of February 28, 2011, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the period from November 18, 2010 (inception) through February 28, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Benaco, Inc. as of February 28, 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from November 18, 2010 (inception) through February 28, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements the Company has suffered a loss from operations and has limited working capital that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

F-5 35 BENACO, INC. (A Development Stage Company) Notes To Financial Statements February 28, 2011 (Audited) NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS Benaco, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on November 18, 20010. The Company is in the development stage as defined under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC 915-205 "Development-Stage Entities. and intends to commence operations in the business of Bohemian Cristal Chandeliers distribution . The Company has not generated any revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. For the period from inception, November 18, 20010 through February 28, 2011 the Company has accumulated losses of $499. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $499 as of February 28, 2011 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F-6 36 BENACO, INC. (A Development Stage Company) Notes To Financial Statements February 28, 2011 (Audited) NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Foreign Currency Translation The Company's functional currency and its reporting currency is the United States dollar. Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences). The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments and accordingly basic loss and diluted loss per share are equal. Fiscal Periods The Company's fiscal year end is February 28, 2011.

ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTOR AND OFFICERS Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Corporate Law provides, in part, that a corporation shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Similar indemnity is authorized for such persons against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred in defense or settlement of any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and provided further that (unless a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise provides) such person shall not have been adjudged liable to the corporation. Any such indemnification may be made only as authorized in each specific case upon a determination by the stockholders or disinterested directors that indemnification is proper because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct. Where an officer or a director is successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action referred to above, we must indemnify him against the expenses which such offer or director actually or reasonably incurred. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 40 ITEM 15.
