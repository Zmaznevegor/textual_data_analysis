THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED. THERE IS NO MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENT FOR THE OFFERING TO PROCEED. VIATECH CORP. 6,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK $0.01 PER SHARE This is the initial offering of common stock of Viatech Corp. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are offering for sale a total of 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.01 per share. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, will attempt to sell the shares. This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.01 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240 days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 6,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 6,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. Offering Price Expenses Proceeds to Company Per share $ 0.01 $ 0.0013 $ 0.0087 Total $ 60,000 $ 8,000 $ 52,000 Viatech Corp. is a development stage company and has recently started its operation. To date we have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We do not have sufficient capital for operations. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can afford a loss of your investment. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for Viatech Corp. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop. We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.

Page | 4 PROSPECTUS SUMMARY AS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, WE, US, OUR, AND VIATECH CORP. REFERS TO VIATECH CORP. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. VIATECH CORP. We are a development stage company and intend to provide interior design and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation services. Viatech Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on September 22, 2011. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $30,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. We expect our operations to begin to generate revenues during months 6-12 after completion of this offering. However, there is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate any revenue. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. After twelve months period we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $8,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at Mikolase Alse, 586, Cesky Brod, Czech Republic 28201. Our phone number is (702) 425-4104. From inception until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (September 22, 2011) through March 31, 2012, reports no revenues and a net loss of $224. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Viatech Corp. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and entered into a Professional Service Agreement with Petr Baroch dated May 10, 2012. As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop. Viatech Corp. has no current plans to merge with another operating company. The company is publicly offering its shares to raise funds in order for our business to develop its operations and increase its likelihood of commercial success. THE OFFERING The Issuer: VIATECH CORP. Securities Being Offered: 6,000,000 shares of common stock. Price Per Share: $0.01 Duration of the Offering: The shares will be offered for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240 days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 6,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 6,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. Gross Proceeds $60,000 Securities Issued and Outstanding: There are 7,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus, held by our sole officer and director, Viatcheslav Gelshteyn Subscriptions All subscriptions once accepted by us are irrevocable.

Risk Factors See Risk Factors and the other information in this prospectus for a discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. Page | 5 SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The tables and information below are derived from our audited financial statements for the period from September 22, 2011(Inception) to March 31, 2012. Financial Summary March 31, 2012 ($) (Audited) Cash and Deposits 7,200 Total Assets 7,200 Total Liabilities 424 Total Stockholders Equity 6,776 Statement of Operations Accumulated From September 22, 2011 (Inception) to March 31, 2012 ($) (Audited) Total Expenses 224 Net Loss for the Period (224) Net Loss per Share - RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS ASSOCIATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We were incorporated on September 22, 2011 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations in the interior design and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation services. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. As of March 31, 2012, we had cash in the amount of $7,200 and liabilities of $424. As of this date, we have no income and just recently started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. Page | 6 WE HAVE YET TO EARN REVENUE AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FINANCING. OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT HAS EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. We have accrued net losses of $224 for the period from our inception on September 22, 2011 to March 31, 2012, and have no revenues as of this date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations in the interior design and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation services. Further, the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Ronald R. Chadwick, P.C. our independent registered public accounting firm, has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. As a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our independent registered public accountants comments when determining if an investment in Viatech Corp. is suitable. We require minimum funding of approximately $30,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our sole officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Mr. Gelshteyn has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $8,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations. WE HAVE ONLY ONE CLIENT AND WE CANNOT GUARANTEE WE WILL EVER HAVE NEW CLIENTS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN NEW CLIENTS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS. We have identified only one client and we cannot guarantee we will ever have any new clients. Even if we obtain new clients for our services, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to use our services to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations. WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM LARGER AND WELL ESTABLISHED COMPANIES, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND ABILITY TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. Our industry is competitive. There are many different interior design and architectural visualization companies in Europe and our services are not unique to their services. Even though the industry is highly fragmented, it has a number of large and well established companies, which are profitable and have developed a brand name. Aggressive marketing tactics implemented by our competitors could impact our limited financial resources and adversely affect our ability to compete in our market . THE EFFECT OF THE RECENT ECONOMIC CRISIS MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. The recent global crisis has caused disruption and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy, and has impacted levels of consumer spending. These macroeconomic developments may affect our business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. For example, our potential customers may never start spending with us or may have difficulty paying us. A slow or uneven pace of economic recovery would negatively affect our ability to start our business and obtain financing. Page | 7 OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT CREATE ALTERNATE FORMS OF INTERIOR DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURAL VISUALIZATION. The multimedia industry in general and the interior design and architectural visualization industry in particular continue to undergo significant changes, primarily due to technological developments. Due to this rapid growth of technology, we cannot accurately predict the overall effect that such changes may have on the potential revenue from and profitability of companys services. Any future changes in technology may change the way we operate our business and add unforeseen costs to our business. BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT CLIENTS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS. Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN 53.85% OR MORE OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, IF ALL THE SHARES BEING OFFERED ARE SOLD, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS. If maximum offering shares will be sold, Mr. Gelshteyn, our sole officer and director, will own 53.85 % of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Gelshteyn may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. BECAUSE OUR PRINCIPAL ASSETS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND VIATCHESLAV GELSHTEYN, OUR SOLE DIRECTOR AND OFFICER, RESIDES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR AN INVESTOR TO ENFORCE ANY RIGHT BASED ON U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AGAINST US AND/OR MR. GELSHTEYN, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT RENDERED BY A UNITED STATES COURT AGAINST US OR MR. GELSHTEYN. Our principal operations and assets are located outside of the United States, and Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our sole officer and director is a non-resident of the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult to effect service of process on Mr. Gelshteyn in the United States, and it may be difficult to enforce any judgment rendered against Mr. Gelshteyn. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for an investor to bring an action against Mr. Gelshteyn, in the event that an investor believes that such investors rights have been infringed under the U.S. securities laws, or otherwise. Even if an investor is successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of Czech Republic may render that investor unable to enforce a judgment against the assets of Mr. Gelshteyn. As a result, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, director or major shareholder, compared to shareholders of a corporation doing business and whose officers and directors reside within the United States. Additionally, because of our assets are located outside of the United States, they will be outside of the jurisdiction of United States courts to administer, if we become subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. As a result, if we declare bankruptcy or insolvency, our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the United States under United States bankruptcy laws. BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING ENOUGH CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS. Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations. He will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week to our operations. Because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations. Page | 8 KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL MAY LEAVE THE COMPANY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. The Company is entirely dependent on the efforts of its sole officer and director. The Company does not have an employment agreement in place with its sole officer and director. His departure or the loss of any other key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on the business. The Company believes that all commercially reasonable efforts have been made to minimize the risks attendant with the departure by key personnel from service. However, there is no guarantee that replacement personnel, if any, will help the Company to operate profitably. The Company does not maintain key person life insurance on its sole officer and director ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE ARRANGE THROUGH THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. We must raise additional capital in order for our business plan to succeed. Our most likely source of additional capital will be through the sale of additional shares of common stock. Such stock issuances will cause stockholders' interests in our company to be diluted. Such dilution will negatively affect the value of an investor's shares. OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. We have never operated as a public company. Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. AS AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY UNDER THE JOBS ACT, WE ARE PERMITTED TO RELY ON EXEMPTIONS FROM CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS . We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: - have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; - comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); - submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and - disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Page | 9 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES. The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. Additionally, as the Company was formed on September 22, 2011 and has only a limited operating history and no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker, appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock. OUR PRESIDENT, MR. GELSHTEYN DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFRERING AND SELLING SECURITIES , AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Mr. Gelshteyn does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us. WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES. This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in selling at least half of the shares and we receive the proceeds in the amount of $30,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan. THE TRADING IN OUR SHARES WILL BE REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULE 15G-9 WHICH ESTABLISHED THE DEFINITION OF A PENNY STOCK. The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $6,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING. We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Viatech Corp. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment. Page | 10 WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000. We will have to utilize funds from Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $8,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL RISKS AND SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. We will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect to incur significant continuing costs, including accounting fees and staffing costs, in order to maintain compliance with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Development of our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems, processes and information systems. If our business develops and grows, our current design for internal control over financial reporting will not be sufficient to enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, as we develop our business, such development and growth will necessitate changes to our internal control systems, processes and information systems, all of which will require additional costs and expenses. In the future, if we fail to complete the annual Section 404 evaluation in a timely manner, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. However, as an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH RULES REQUIRING THE ADOPTION OF CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES, OUR SHAREHOLDERS HAVE LIMITED PROTECTIONS AGAINST INTERESTED DIRECTOR TRANSACTIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SIMILAR MATTERS. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the SEC, the New York and American Stock Exchanges and the Nasdaq Stock Market, as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities which are listed on those exchanges or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than necessary, we have not yet adopted these measures. Because none of our directors are independent, we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees. As a result, the director has the ability, among other things, to determine his own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our shareholders without protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations. Page | 11 THE COSTS TO MEET OUR REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY SUBJECT TO THE EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY RESULT IN US HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OR EVEN TO MEET ROUTINE BUSINESS OBLIGATIONS. As a public entity subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, we incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and SEC filings and compliance. We estimate that these costs will increase if our business volume and activity increases. As a result of such expenses, we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus. USE OF PROCEEDS Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and best-efforts basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. The offering scenarios presented are for illustrative purposes only and the actual amount of proceeds, if any, may differ. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $60,000 as anticipated. Gross proceeds $30,000 $45,000 $60,000 Offering expenses $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 Net proceeds $ 22,000 $ 37,000 $ 52,000 Establishing an office $ 1,000 $ 2,000 $ 3,000 Website development $ 1,500 $ 3,000 $ 4,000 Software purchase $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 PCs purchase $ 2,000 $ 2,500 $ 3,000 Marketing and advertising $ 1,500 $ 11,000 $ 23,000 SEC reporting and compliance $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 Miscellaneous expenses $ - $ 2,500 $ 3,000 The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Gelshteyn will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering.There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Gelshteyn. Mr. Gelshteyn will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities. Page | 12 DILUTION The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.01 per share. This price is significantly higher than the price paid by the Companys officer for common equity since the Companys inception on September 22, 2011. Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, the Companys sole officer and director, paid $.001 per share for the 7,000,000 shares of common stock he purchased from the Company on March 29, 2012. Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders. As of March 31, 2012, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was $6,776 or approximately $0.001 per share based upon 7,000,000 shares outstanding. If 100% of the Shares Are Sold: Upon completion of this offering, in the event all of the shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 13,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $58,776 or approximately $0.0045 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0.001. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0035 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0045 per share. After completion of this offering, if 6,000,000 shares are sold, investors in the offering will own 46.15% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $60,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own 53.85% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totalling $7,000.00 or $0.001 per share. If 75% of the Shares Are Sold Upon completion of this offering, in the event 4,500,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 11,500,000 shares to be outstanding will be $43,776, or approximately $0.0038 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0.001. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0028 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0038 per share. After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own approximately 39.13% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $45,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own approximately 60.87% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totaling $7,000 or $0.001 per share. If 50% of the Shares Are Sold Upon completion of this offering, in the event 3,000,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 10,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $28,776, or approximately $0.0029 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0.001. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be increased by $0.0019 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0029 per share. After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own 30% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $30,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own 70% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totaling $7,000 or $0.001 per share.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. Our cash balance is $7,200 as of March 31, 2012. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of March 31, 2012, Mr. Gelshteyn advanced us $424. Mr. Gelshteyn, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $30,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. After twelve months period we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. The company has no current plans to merge with another operating company. Our principal executive offices are located at Mikolase Alse, 586, Cesky Brod, Czech Republic 28201. Our phone number is (702) 425-4104. Page | 15 We are a development stage company and have generated no revenue to date. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. Our expansion may include expanding our office facilities, hiring sales personnel and entering into agreements with new clients. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $8,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our Plan of Operation below to maintain a reporting status Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage. To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to continue our proposed operations but we cannot guarantee that once we continue operations we will stay in business after doing so. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $60,000 from this offering, it will last one year, but we may need more funds for business operations in the next year, and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money. PLAN OF OPERATION After the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions, we intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital. During this period, our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our architectural services. Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows: Establish our Office Time Frame: 1 st - 3 rd months. Material costs: minimum $1,000. Upon completion of the offering we plan to set up office in Czech Republic and acquire the necessary equipment to continue operations. We plan to purchase office equipment such as telephones, fax, office supplies, furniture, professional drafting kits, lamps, drafting machines, drafting parallel straightedges, tracing projectors, blueprint measuring tools as well as drafting paper and other. Our sole officer and director, Viatcheslav Gelshteyn will take care of our initial administrative duties. We believe that it will cost at least $1,000 to set up office and obtain the necessary equipment and stationery to continue operations. If we sell 75% of the shares offered we will buy better equipment with advanced features that will cost us approximately $1,000 more. In this case, set up costs will be approximately $2,000. In the event we sell all of the shares offered we will buy additional and more advanced equipment that will help us in everyday operations; therefore the office set up cots will be approximately $3,000. Purchase PCs and Software Time Frame: 2 nd  4 th months. Material costs: minimum $2,000. After our office is established we intend to purchase computers and software necessary for our business. If we sell 50% shares in this offering, the purchase costs of the computers we plan on acquiring will be approximately $2,000. If we sell 75% of the shares offered we will buy better PCs with advanced features that will cost us approximately $2,500. In the event we sell all of the shares offered we will buy more advanced PCs and it will cost approximately $3,000. We plan to purchase AutoCad software for architects, designers and visualization specialists, which costs approximately $4,500. We also plan to purchase Autodesk 3ds Max Design 2012 software which costs approximately $3,500. Page | 16 Develop Our Website Time Frame: 2 nd  5 th months. Material costs: $1,500-$4,000. During this period, we intend to begin developing our website. Our sole officer and director, Viatcheslav Gelshteyn will be in charge of registering our web domain. As of the date of this prospectus we have not yet identified or registered any domain names for our website. Once we register our web domain, we plan to hire a web designer to help us with the design and develop our website. We do not have any written agreements with any web designers at current time. The website development costs, including site design and implementation will be approximately $1,500. If we 75% of the shares offered and all of the shares offered we will develop more sophisticated and well designed web site, therefore developing cost will be $3,000 and $4,000 accordingly. Updating and improving our website will continue throughout the lifetime of our operations. Marketing Time Frame: 6 th - 12 th months. Material costs: $1,500-$22,000. Once our web site is operational we intend to start marketing program. Our sole officer and director, Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, will be responsible for marketing of our services. We intend to use marketing strategies, such as web advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We also expect to get new clients from "word of mouth" advertising where our new clients will refer their colleagues to us. We will encourage such advertising by rewarding person who referred new clients to us. We also plan to attend shows and exhibitions in architectural and construction industries, which help architects, builders, advertising agencies, interior designers, home renovators, home owners and various sectors which have need of 3D visualization come face to face and find new business opportunities and partners. We intend to spend at least $1,500 on marketing efforts during the first year. Marketing is an ongoing matter that will continue during the life of our operations. Negotiate service agreements with potential customers Time Frame: 6 th -12 th months. No material costs . Once our website is operational, office is established and equipment is obtained, we also plan to begin to market our services. Initially, our sole officer and director, Mr. Gelshteyn, will look for potential customers. As of May 24, 2012 we have signed a Professional Service Agreement with Petr Baroch, dated May 10, 2012. Even though the negotiation of additional agreements with potential customers will be ongoing during the life of our operations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find successful agreements, in which case our business may fail and we will have to cease our operations. Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of service agreements at the end of the twelve month period, there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. In summary, during 1 st -6 th month we should have established our office and developed our website. After this point we should be ready to start more significant operations and start selling our services. During months 6-12 we will be developing our marketing campaign. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate any revenue. Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our president will be devoting approximately twenty hours per week to our operations. Once we expand operations, and are able to attract more and more customers to use our services, Mr. Gelshteyn has agreed to commit more time as required. Because Mr. Gelshteyn will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations Page | 17 Estimated Expenses for the Next Twelve Month Period The following provides an overview of our estimated expenses to fund our plan of operation over the next twelve months. Description If 50% shares sold If 75% shares sold If 100% shares sold Fees Fees Fees SEC reporting and compliance Establishing an office Website development Marketing and advertising PCs and Software Purchase Other Expenses $8,000 $1,000 $1,500 $1,500 $10,000 - $8,000 $2,000 $3,000 $11,000 $10,500 $2,500 $8,000 $3,000 $4,000 $23,000 $11,000 $3,000 Total $22,000 $37,000 $52,000 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder. Results of operations From Inception on September 22, 2011 to March 31, 2012 During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan and executed a Professional Service Agreement with Petr Baroch, dated May 10, 2012. Our loss since inception is $224. We have not meaningfully commenced our proposed business operations and will not do so until we have completed this offering. Since inception, we have sold 7,000,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director for net proceeds of $7,000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of March 31, 2012, the Company had $7,200 cash and our liabilities were $424, comprising $424 owed to Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our sole officer and director. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. Since inception, we have sold 7,000,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $7,000. Page | 18 We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation. We will have to utilize funds from Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. However, Mr. Gelshteyn has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $30,000.We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 months financial requirement. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation. In a long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $8,000. Management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies, volatility in architectural design market pose the most significant challenges to the Companys success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations. Should the Company fail to sell less than one-third of its shares under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abort completely the implementation of its 12-month plan of operation. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS General Viatech Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 22, 2011 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. We do not have revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We are a development-stage company formed to provide interior design and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation services. We have recently started our operation. As of today, we have developed our business plan, and executed a Professional Service Agreement with Petr Baroch, dated May 10, 2012 to create for him a complex interior design project of a residential building. We maintain our statutory registered agent's office at 2360 Corporate Circle, Suite 400, Henderson, Nevada 89074. Our business office is located at Mikolase Alse, 586, Cesky Brod, Czech Republic 28201. Our telephone number is (702) 425-4104. Our Services We intend to provide interior design and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation services and plan on using advanced computer technology to produce photo realistic 3D rendering, walk-through animation and 360 degree panorama. Working from sketches to fully detailed plans, we plan to create high detail, high quality three-dimensional renderings. Our images and animations can be used for design and planning, property sales, buildings, and the effective communication of concepts to clientele. Three-dimensional rendering and 3D modeling is accomplished by taking two-dimensional forms and giving them volume. Created with specialized software, the computer-generated images are used in a variety of fields including but not limited to architecture, science, geology and video games. Page | 19 We plan to create a unique design for every new project and also offer alternative choices of the design view. Then, after finishing concept of project we will develop the architectural sketches and further the blue-print documentation which are going to include fully developed layouts, crossings and detailed information about every space of designed area. For every project we will create 3d-models of the design object in all steps from the concept to the fully detailed plans. Modeling, rendering and final visual presentation will be included in our service. In addition, we plan provide consulting regarding materials, furniture choice and supply to our clients during full period of construction. We also intend to manage the working relationship and communication between our clients and builders. We will provide our clients with complete drawings packages in either electronic or hard copy formats. We intend to provide several basic types of work: Architectural projects We intend to provide architectural design services like building and structural design, architectural drafting, architectural drawing, architectural lighting, plans, cost estimation, layering, 3D modeling and architectural renderings that will show case single buildings, sites or structures, exterior or interior, color and texture of proposed materials, and the relationship with the surrounding buildings and landscape. Architectural renderings are convincing marketing tools to visualize and demonstrate certain aspects of a future building or apartment to its buyers. We intend to concentrate on concept architectural projects of new private and renovate building projects with further sketches and blue-prints documentation development. Also we plan to be involved in projects of public buildings and areas. Interior design projects We plan to offer complex projects of interior design of most important living spaces inside the building. By our philosophy, it is very important to suggest our clients the professional vision of living areas where they will spend their daily live. That project usually includes blue-prints, detailed sketches, 3d-visualisation, rendering, finish material and furniture choose and construction process supervising. 3d modeling Hand-drawings and written explanations of the architectural and design ideas are not enough for fully detailed projects. Therefore, in all steps of our projects we will provide fully detailed 3D-renderings and 3D virtual reality architectural animations (also known as walk-through or fly-through animations), a short architectural movies created on a computer. With 3D walk-through any specific viewpoint can be viewed from any angle or height giving a real photorealistic feeling. Some of the advantages of virtual 3D walk-through are: - Actual structure, architecture and building materials can be shown; - It brings a possibility to explore and experiment with colors, textures, and other architectural details; - External/Internal lighting such as natural lighting, based upon window direction, time of year and time of day can be previewed; - 3D Architectural animation will include exterior features such as landscaping, trees, hedges, fences; - Multiple design options can be explored and resolved before building begins. Landscape architectural projects As well as working with private clients we also plan to work with more complicated landscape architectural projects. Landscape architecture is the design of outdoor public areas, organized green spaces in the cities, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioral, or aesthetic outcomes. Potential clients We plan to commence operations in architectural field and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well as municipal organized public areas. Our potential clients will include architects, developers and builders, advertising agencies, interior designers, home renovators, home owners, city municipalities and various sectors which have need of 3D visualization. We intend to participate in local and international architectural and interior design competition in order to take part in significant projects and spread the business in Czech Republic and other countries. Page | 20 Marketing Our sole officer and director, Viatcheslav Gelshteyn, will be responsible for marketing of our services. The marketing and advertising will be targeted to small businesses, builders, advertising agencies, home renovators, home owners and various sectors which have need of architectural and interior design. Our methods of communication will include: phone calls, email, and regular mail. We will ask our satisfied clients for referrals. We will also promote our product through word of mouth. We will be targeting clients in Czech Republic as well as in Europe. We plan to develop a website to market, display and sell our services. One of the most powerful aspects of online marketing is the ability to target our chosen group with a high degree of accuracy and cost effective way. We will use the following online marketing tools to direct traffic to our website and identify potential customers: Banner advertising: New technologies have given to online advertisement customization capabilities when it comes to banner advertising. Advertisers now have the ability to have their banner ads appear on pages devoted to certain types of content. We can have our ad appear on a site only when it is presenting an article on the architectural design industry. We can also use geo-targeting tactics. By tracking the IP address of the user, we can have ads appear before those in a location we are targeting. Pay Per Click: Pay-Per-Click allows us to create a small text ad, and then have that ad appear on screen when the user is searching on keyword relating to our business. Google and its AdWords program is currently the leader in this space, with Yahoo! and Microsoft in second and third place respectively. With Pay-Per-Click our ad appears in the Sponsored Links section of the search results page. Organic Search: The remainder of the search results page is made up of organic or "natural" search results. These listings are generated based on the HTML tags and relevant content found in a website. By specifically tailoring these elements, we can focus on particular audiences in a similar fashion as Pay-Per-Click. As of the date of this prospectus we have not yet identified or registered any domain names for our website. To accomplish this, we plan to contract an independent web designing company. Our website will describe our advantages, show our contact information, and include some general information. We intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics mentioned above. We intend to promote our website by displaying it on our promotion materials. We will also promote our product through word of mouth and use internet promotion tools on Facebook, Myspace and Twitter to advertise our company and create links to our website. To enhance advertising of our services we plan to keep improving and developing our website to make it as user friendly as possible. Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of customers using our services, there is no guarantee that it will cover our costs and that we will be able retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. Competition There are many barriers of entry in the interior design and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation business and level of competition is extremely high. The principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and quality of service. We will be in a market where we compete with many domestic and international companies offering similar services. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better price for similar product than us which may also cause us to lose business. We foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Viatech Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many participants in the business of providing architectural services. Many established, yet well financed entities are currently active in the business of providing such services. Nearly all Viatech Corp.'s competitors have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than Viatech Corp. We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in being able to provide such services and become a successful company in the interior design and architectural visualization industry. Therefore, Viatech Corp. may not be able to establish itself within the industry at all. Page | 21 Contracts We have executed a Professional Service Agreement with Petr Baroch, dated May 10, 2012. According to the agreement, Viatech, Corp. will create a complex interior design project of a residential building. The material terms of the Contract are the following: 1.

We. will revise any elements of the 3D scene which were overlooked or elements which do not conform to the data provided (furniture, details and so on). Colors and textures may be altered after the draft rendering submission, at the request of the Mr. Baroch, at no additional charge. 3. We will provide fully detailed blue prints documentation of all areas, details, decorative elements. 4. We will not be responsible for delays in providing structural approval of renderings.

The term of the Agreement shall commence on the date of signing and shall continue until we satisfactorily complete performance of services. A copy of the Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this registration statement. Insurance We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.

Title of Class Name and Address of Beneficial Owner Amount and Nature of Beneficial Ownership Percentage Common Stock Viatcheslav Gelshteyn Mikolase Alse, 586, Cesky Brod, Czech Republic 28201 7,000,000 shares of common stock (direct) 100 % (1) A beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.

Future sales by existing stockholders A total of 7,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act.

The Company is registering an additional of 6,000,000 shares of its common stock for sale at the price of $0.01 per share. There is no arrangement to address the possible effect of the offering on the price of the stock. In connection with the Companys selling efforts in the offering, Viatcheslav Gelshteyn will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act, but rather will rely upon the safe harbor provisions of SEC Rule 3a4-1, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Generally speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides an exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated with an issuer that participate in an offering of the issuers securities. Mr. Gelshteyn is not subject to any statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act. Mr. Gelshteyn will not be compensated in connection with his participation in the offering by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in our securities. Mr. Gelshteyn is not, nor has he been within the past 12 months, a broker or dealer, and he is not, nor has he been within the past 12 months, an associated person of a broker or dealer. At the end of the offering, Mr. Gelshteyn will continue to primarily perform substantial duties for the Company or on its behalf otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities. Mr. Gelshteyn will not participate in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months other than in reliance on Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1(a)(4)(i) or (iii). Viatech Corp. will receive all proceeds from the sale of the 6,000,000 shares being offered. The price per share is fixed at $0.01 for the duration of this offering. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange or quoted over-the-counter, we intend to seek to have our shares of common stock quoted on the Over-the Counter Bulletin Board. In order to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. However, sales by the Company must be made at the fixed price of $0.01 until a market develops for the stock. The Companys shares may be sold to purchasers from time to time directly by and subject to the discretion of the Company. Further, the Company will not offer its shares for sale through underwriters, dealers, agents or anyone who may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions from the Company and/or the purchasers of the shares for whom they may act as agents. The shares of common stock sold by the Company may be occasionally sold in one or more transactions; all shares sold under this prospectus will be sold at a fixed price of $0.01 per share. In order to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states, the securities will be offered or sold in those only if they have been registered or qualified for sale; an exemption from such registration or if qualification requirement is available and with which Viatech Corp. has complied. In addition and without limiting the foregoing, the Company will be subject to applicable provisions, rules and regulations under the Exchange Act with regard to security transactions during the period of time when this Registration Statement is effective. Viatech Corp. will pay all expenses incidental to the registration of the shares (including registration pursuant to the securities laws of certain states) which we expect to be $8,000. Procedures for Subscribing If you decide to subscribe for any shares in this offering, you must - execute and deliver a subscription agreement; and - deliver a check or certified funds to us for acceptance or rejection. All checks for subscriptions must be made payable to Viatech Corp. The Company will deliver stock certificates attributable to shares of common stock purchased directly to the purchasers. Page | 26 Right to Reject Subscriptions We have the right to accept or reject subscriptions in whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason. All monies from rejected subscriptions will be returned immediately by us to the subscriber, without interest or deductions. Subscriptions for securities will be accepted or rejected with letter by mail within 48 hours after we receive them. Penny Stock Regulations You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. STATE SECURITIES - BLUE SKY LAWS There is no established public market for our common stock, and there can be no assurance that any market will develop in the foreseeable future. Transfer of our common stock may also be restricted under the securities or securities regulations laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as "Blue Sky" laws. Absent compliance with such individual state laws, our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions. Because the securities registered hereunder have not been registered for resale under the blue sky laws of any state, the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future, should be aware that there may be significant state blue-sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to sell the securities and of purchasers to purchase the securities. Accordingly, investors may not be able to liquidate their investments and should be prepared to hold the common stock for an indefinite period of time. In order to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states, the securities will be offered or sold in those only if they have been registered or qualified for sale; an exemption from such registration or if qualification requirement is available and with which Viatech has complied. In addition and without limiting the foregoing, the Company will be subject to applicable provisions, rules and regulations under the Exchange Act with regard to security transactions during the period of time when this Registration Statement is effective.

PREFERRED STOCK We do not have an authorized class of preferred stock. WARRANTS We have not issued and do not have any outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. OPTIONS We have not issued and do not have any outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock. CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES We have not issued and do not have any outstanding securities convertible into shares of our common stock or any rights convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock. ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW Currently, we have no Nevada shareholders and since this offering will not be made in the State of Nevada, no shares will be sold to its residents. Further, we do not do business in Nevada directly or through an affiliate corporation and we do not intend to do so. Accordingly, there are no anti-takeover provisions that have the affect of delaying or preventing a change in our control. DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Page | 28 INDEMNIFICATION Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

CHADWICK, P.C. Certified Public Accountant 2851 South Parker Road, Suite 720 Aurora, Colorado 80014 Telephone (303)306-1967 Fax (303)306-1944 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors Viatech Corp. Henderson, Nevada I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Viatech Corp. (a development stage company) as of March 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the period from September 22, 2011 (inception) through March 31, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Viatech Corp. as of March 31, 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from September 22, 2011 (inception) through March 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements the Company has suffered a loss from operations and has limited working capital that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

(A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2012 NOTE 1- ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS VIATECH CORP. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on September 22, 2011 and intends to provide interior design and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation services. The Company is in the development stage as defined under Accounting Codification Standard, Development Stage Entities (ASC-915). The Company has not generated any revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. For the period from inception on September 22, 2011 through March 31, 2012 the Company has accumulated losses of $224. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $224 as of March 31, 2012 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At March 31, 2012 the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F-6 Page | 36 VIATECH CORP. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2012 NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments and accordingly basic loss and diluted loss per share are the same. Fiscal Periods The Company's fiscal year end is March 31. F-7 Page | 37 VIATECH CORP. (A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2012 NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY The authorized capital of the Company is 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $ 0.001 per share. On March 29, 2012 the Company issued 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.001 per share for total cash proceeds of $7,000. As of March 31, 2012 the Company had 7,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTONS On March 29, 2012, a Director purchased 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.001 per share for cash of $7,000. The Director loaned $424 to the Company to pay for business expenses relating incorporation fees. This loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. NOTE 6- INCOME TAXES As of March 31, 2012, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $424 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2032. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. NOTE 7  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company has evaluated all events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date when the financial statements were issued. The Management of the Company determined that there were no reportable subsequent events to be disclosed.

Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
