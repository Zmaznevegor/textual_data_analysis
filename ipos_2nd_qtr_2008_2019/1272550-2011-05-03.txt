Our business consists of providing business consulting services to our clients. Much of our expertise is focused on core areas of business processes used throughout the corporate world including: project management, business analysis, business consulting, and strategic consulting. Typical initiatives in which we provide expertise include compliance and regulatory, merger and acquisition, and business process reengineering efforts. A typical customer is an organization with complex business processes, large amounts of data to manage, and changing business requirements. You can learn more about our business from our website at www.premieralliance.com. Our website and the information contained therein, however, does not constitute a part of this prospectus. The Offering The shares of our common stock covered by this prospectus are being registered for resale by the Selling Stockholders, from time to time in transactions (which may include block transactions) on the OTC Bulletin Board (or other markets on which shares of our common stock are then traded), in negotiated transactions, through put or call option transactions relating to the shares, through short sales of shares, or a combination of such methods of sale, at fixed prices which may be changed, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. None of the Selling Stockholders has entered into agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriters or broker-dealers regarding the sale of their shares. Selling Stockholders The Selling Stockholders consist of (a) two accredited investors who acquired Series C Preferred Stock and Series C Warrants in the March Placement, (b) one placement agent that acquired Series C Warrants as commissions in the March Placement, and two registered brokers that acquired Series C Warrants for services rendered in the March Placement, (c) three accredited investors who acquired Unit Warrants in a private placement of Units (“Unit Placement”), (d) three registered brokers that acquired Unit Agent Warrants as commissions in the Unit Placement, and (e) two consultants who acquired Consulting Warrants for services rendered. Although the Series C Warrants, Unit Warrants, Unit Agent Warrants, and Consulting Warrants may have different terms and conditions, each is exercisable into one share of our common stock at $0.77 per share; accordingly, we may at times refer to them in this prospectus collectively as the “Warrants”. The specific transactions in which these shares were acquired are detailed in the Selling Stockholders section later in this prospectus. We will receive none of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders. However, if all of the Warrants covered hereby are exercised, Premier will receive aggregate proceeds of $6,719,283, all of which will be added to Premier’s working capital. Corporate Information We were incorporated on January 5, 2000 as Continuum Group C Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada in accordance with a joint plan of reorganization for The Continuum Group, Inc. in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York. The bankruptcy court entered an order on September 15, 1999 creating four separate entities, including Continuum Group C Inc. Until November 5, 2004, we had no business operations and no revenues. On that date, we consummated the share exchange and merger contemplated by the share exchange agreement dated as of October 12, 2004, between our company, Premier Alliance Group, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("North Carolina Premier"), and the shareholders of North Carolina Premier. As a result, North Carolina Premier became our wholly owned subsidiary, and we changed our name to Premier Alliance Group, Inc. Prior to this merger, management operated the Company as a separate organization. Our financial statements included in this prospectus for periods prior to the merger are those of North Carolina Premier. Our principal executive office is located at 4521 Sharon Road, Suite 300, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28211, telephone number (704) 521-8077. 5 table of contents FORW ARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us, and the industry in which we operate. We use words such as plans, believes, expects, future, intends and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors more fully described elsewhere in this prospectus. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. R ISK FACTORS The securities offered by the Selling Stockholders involve a high degree of risk and should only be purchased by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment. Prospective purchasers should carefully consider, among other things, the following risk factors and the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the notes to those statements, prior to making an investment decision. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry A decline in the price of, or demand for, any of our business consulting and solution services, would seriously harm our revenues and operating margins. Our business consulting and business solutions accounted for substantially all of our revenues in 2009. We anticipate that revenues from our business consulting and solution services will continue to constitute substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Consequently, a decline in the price of, or demand for, business consulting and solution services would seriously harm our business. Our revenues depend on a small number of large sales. If any of these customers decide they will no longer use our services, our revenues will decrease and our financial performance will be severely impacted. To date, we have received a significant portion of our revenues from large sales to a small number of customers. During 2010, our six largest customers, Duke Energy, Bank of America, GMAC Financial Services, SourceCorp, Wells Fargo, Charlotte Mecklenburg Board of Education together comprised approximately 61% of our total annual revenues. Our operating results may be harmed if we are not able to complete one or more substantial sales to any large customers or we are unable to collect accounts receivable from any of our large customers in any future period. Intense competition in our target market could impair our ability to grow and to achieve profitability. If we do not grow, our competitive ability will be severely restricted, which would decrease our profitability. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. Our competitors include Deloitte, Comsys, North Highland, Accenture, CIBER as well as other national firms and a number of smaller regional firms. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources, or greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any one of which could seriously harm our business. Our lengthy sales cycle could cause delays in revenue growth, which could make it more difficult to achieve our growth objectives. The period between our initial contact with a potential customer and that customer’s purchase of our services is often long. A customer’s decision to purchase our services involves a significant allocation of resources on our part, is influenced by a customer’s budgetary cycles, and in many instances involves a preferred-vendor process. To successfully sell our services, generally we must educate our potential customers regarding the uses and benefits of our services, which can require significant time and resources. Many of our potential customers are large enterprises that generally take longer to designate preferred vendors; our typical sales cycle in connection with becoming an approved vendor has been approximately six to 12 months. Delay or failure to complete sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter, as well as subsequent quarters over which revenues for the sale would likely be recognized. If our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large orders, it would adversely affect the 6 table of contents timing of our revenues and our revenue growth. If we were to experience a delay of several weeks on a large order, it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given quarter. We may not be able to secure necessary funding in the future and may be forced to curtail our planned growth, which would slow or stop our ability to grow, increase revenues, and achieve profitability. For our business to grow, we will require substantial working capital. We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the next twelve months, but if our capital requirements increase materially from those currently planned, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage of our company owned by our current shareholders would be reduced, and those equity securities may have rights that are senior to those of the holders of our currently outstanding securities. Additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to curtail our planned growth, and we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures. There are risks associated with acquisitions. An integral part of our growth strategy is evaluating and, from time to time, consummating acquisitions and strategic transactions. These transactions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management’s attention from running our existing business; increased expenses, including legal, administrative and compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees; increased costs to integrate personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired company with our own; adverse effects on our reported operating results due to possible write-down of goodwill associated with acquisitions; and dilution to stockholders to the extent we issue securities in the transaction. Our executive officers and directors will be able to exert control over us to the detriment of minority shareholders, which will limit our shareholders’ ability to influence the outcome of key decisions. Our executive officers and directors collectively control approximately 76% of the shareholder vote of our company. As a result, if they act together they will be able to control our management and affairs and all matters requiring shareholder approval, including significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing any change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock. Miriam Blech and Isaac Blech have substantial control over our business, giving them the ability to exert control over us to the detriment of minority shareholders, which will limit our shareholders’ ability to influence the outcome of key decisions. Miriam Blech currently owns 60% of our Series C Preferred Stock. Isaac Blech, as sole trustee of a trust that owns our Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase our common stock, currently owns 40% of our Series C Preferred Stock. Together, Mr. Blech, as trustee, and Mrs. Blech currently control own 100% of our Series C Preferred Stock. The holders of a majority of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock have the right to appoint four members and one observer to our Board of Directors. In addition, the vote of a majority of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are required to approve, among other things, (i) any issuance by us of capital stock which is senior to or pari passu with the Series C Preferred Stock; (ii) any issuance of additional shares of preferred stock; (iii) any dividends or payments on outstanding securities; (iv) any liquidation or winding up activities of the company, (v) any change in control or change in the nature of the Company’s business, and (vi) any amendment to our articles of incorporation, by-laws or other governing documents that would result in an adverse change to the rights, preferences, or privileges of the Series C Preferred Stock. Accordingly, Mr. And Mrs. Blech have substantial control over our business and may decide the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including mergers (other than strategic mergers), consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and can also prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. and Mrs. Blech may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership. Risks Related to Our Stock The market for our common stock is limited. Our common stock is thinly-traded and any recently reported sales price may not be a true market-based valuation of our common stock. There can be no assurance that an active market for our common stock will develop. In addition, the stock market in general 7 table of contents has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. Consequently, holders of shares of our common stock may not be able to liquidate their investment in our shares. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders. Even if an active trading market develops, the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume on our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares of common stock at or above your purchase price, if at all. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common stock, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, include: · variations in our quarterly operating results; · failure to meet the market's earnings expectations; · publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry, or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after this offering; · departures of our executive officers, directors or additions/departures of other key personnel; · adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; · actions by stockholders; · changes in market valuations of similar companies; · actual or anticipated poor performance in our underlying investment strategies; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulation, or differing interpretations thereof, · affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; · adverse publicity about the investment management industry, generally, or individual scandals · specifically; · litigation and governmental investigations; and · general market and economic conditions. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by the Selling Stockholders, after completion of this offering, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Our preferred stock has liquidation preferences that may affect our common stock holders. In the event of our dissolution, liquidation or change of control, the holders of our Series B preferred stock and Series C Preferred Stock will receive a liquidation preference in priority over the holders of common stock. A consolidation or merger, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and a sale of 50% or more of our common stock would be treated as a change of control for this purpose. Therefore, it is possible that holders of common stock will not obtain any proceeds upon any such event. The issuance of shares upon conversion of our preferred stock and exercise of outstanding warrants may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. The issuance of shares upon conversion of our preferred stock and exercise of warrants may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders since the selling stockholders may ultimately convert and sell the full amount issuable on conversion. 8 table of contents Anti-dilution provisions of the preferred stock could result in dilution of stockholders. The conversion price of the Preferred Stock is subject to “full-ratchet” anti-dilution provisions for a period of 12 months following issuance, and weighted average anti-dilution thereafter, so that upon future issuances of our common stock or equivalents thereof, subject to specified exceptions, at a price below the conversion price of the Preferred Stock, the conversion price will be reduced, further diluting holders of our common stock. Because we have less than 300 record holders of our common stock, we may elect at any time to terminate our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act. If we choose to do so, our stock price would likely decline. Since we have less than 300 record holders of our common stock, we can suspend our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act at any time by filing a Form 15 with the SEC. If we were to terminate our reporting obligations, we would no longer be required to file periodic reports, including financial information, proxy solicitation materials, or other information with the SEC. This action would cause our common stock to be de-listed from the OTC Bulletin Board, which would likely cause our stock price to decline. If we choose not to periodically report, our ability to raise additional financing would likely be negatively impacted due to a lack of publicly available information about the Company. Our common stock may be considered a “penny stock.” The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define "penny stock" to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors hereunder to sell their shares. In addition, since our common stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of the stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase such stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price. There are risks associated with our stock trading on the OTC Bulletin Board rather than a national exchange. There are significant consequences associated with our stock trading on the OTC Bulletin Board rather than a national exchange. The effects of not being able to list our securities on a national exchange include: · Limited release of the market prices of our securities; · Limited news coverage of us; · Limited interest by investors in our securities; · Volatility of our stock price due to low trading volume; · Increased difficulty in selling our securities in certain states due to “blue sky” restrictions; · Limited ability to issue additional securities or to secure financing. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock. As a result, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value. We have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock, and we do not plan to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance our operations and further expand and grow our business, including growth through acquisitions. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. We cannot assure you that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares. U SE OF PROCEEDS The shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus are being registered for the account of the Selling Stockholders. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares. However, if all of the Warrants offered in this prospectus were exercised, we would receive proceeds of $6,719,283 in the aggregate, which we would use for additional working capital. 9 table of contents DETERMI NATION OF OFFERING PRICE The Selling Stockholders will determine at what price they may sell the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus, and such sales may be made at prevailing market prices, or at privately negotiated prices. MAR KET PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Market information . Our common stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board (‘‘OTCBB’’) under the symbol ‘‘PIMO’’ The following table sets forth the range of high and low bid prices for our common stock for each of the periods indicated as reported by the OTCBB. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not represent actual transactions.

Holders . As of December 31, 2010, there were 164 record holders of our common stock. We believe there are more owners of our common stock whose shares are held by nominees or in street name. Dividends . Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends, as and when declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefore, subject to the dividend and liquidation rights of preferred stock issued and outstanding. We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock, nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 10 table of contents MANA GEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Certain information contained in this Form S-1 includes forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Certain factors, such as unanticipated technological difficulties, changes in domestic and foreign economic, market and regulatory conditions, the inherent uncertainty of financial estimates and projections, and other considerations described as “Risk Factors” in this Form S-1 could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update the matters discussed in this report. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in this Form S-1. Results of Operations 2010 As Compared to 2009 In 2010, we recorded revenue of $17.1 million, an increase of 83.8% when compared to 2009 revenue of $9.3 million. We attribute this increase to 2 items, 1) the addition of revenue from the 3 acquisitions completed in October 2009, April 2010 and September 2010 and 2) continued progress made in transitioning to more business consulting initiatives versus pure technology focused efforts. The business consulting work we have focused on includes governance/compliance/regulatory and business process/reengineering efforts. This work has been less impacted from economic downturn allowing us to avoid the significant drops in revenue that affected pure technology consulting companies. The legacy business without the acquisitions grew 19.5% from 2009 to 2010. Cost of goods, defined as all costs for billable staff, were $12.9 million or 75.8% of revenue in 2010 as compared to $6.9 million or 74.2% of revenue in 2009. Major components making up Cost of goods are wages, subcontract labor, payroll taxes, and benefit costs. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $3.9 million or 22.7% of revenue in 2010 as compared to $2.1 million or 22.7% of revenue in 2009. We were able to effectively manage the overall key G&A expense items to offset any increases; such as overhead benefit costs, legal, accounting, other professional services, rent, travel, business insurance and network/phone expenses. The items that had significant increases in 2010 were all tied to M&A activity (increases in professional services for legal, accounting, M&A, and funding, non billable travel, public relations and investor relations) and a non cash charge of $163,842 for stock option grants in 2010. Operating income was $245,955 or 1.4% of revenue in 2010 as compared to $295,006 or 3.1% of revenue in 2009. Adding back M&A related expenses totaling $397,000 would provide an adjusted operating income of $643,000 or 3.8%. Other income and expense consisted of net expense of $19,268 in 2010 compared to net income of $71,757 in 2009. The net expense in 2010 is primarily attributable to four items, 1) debt expense recorded for convertible debenture, related to funding, of $12,735, 2) an increase in value of life insurance policies based on market fluctuation of $37,371 3) interest expense of $55,869, and 4) Derivative income related to fair value of warrants issued. Income taxes for 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.3%, compared to 31.4% in 2009. In 2010 our Net loss was $124,754, or ($.02) per diluted share as compared to 2009 with net income of $251,588, or $.04 per diluted share. The Net Loss includes a non cash charge (deemed dividend) of $273,663 related to the preferred stock containing an embedded beneficial conversion feature. 2009 As Compared to 2008 In 2009, we recorded revenue of $9.3 million, an increase of 3.4% when compared to 2008 revenue of $9.0 million. We attribute this slight increase to 2 items, 1) the addition of revenue from the PeopleSource acquisition completed in October and 2) progress made in transitioning to more business consulting initiatives versus pure technology focused efforts. The business consulting work we have focused on includes compliance/regulatory, M&A, and business process/engineering efforts. This work has been less impacted from economic downturn allowing us to avoid the significant drops in revenue that affected pure technology consulting companies. Cost of goods, defined as all costs for billable staff, were $6.9 million or 74.2% of revenue in 2009 as compared to $6.5 million or 72.2% of revenue in 2008. Major components making up Cost of goods are wages, subcontract labor, payroll taxes, and benefit costs. 11 table of contents General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $2.1 million or 22.6% of revenue in 2009 as compared to $2.3 million or 25.6% of revenue in 2008. We were able to effectively manage the overall key G&A expense items to offset any increases; such as overhead benefit costs, legal, accounting, other professional services, rent, travel, business insurance and network/phone expenses. The decrease in dollars for G&A is attributed to two main cost categories from 2008, we had higher overhead wages as we had more overhead personnel in 2008 as well as we had a non cash charge of $50,700 for stock option grants in 2008. Operating income was $295,006 or 3.1% of revenue in 2009 as compared to $223,662 or 2.5% of revenue in 2008. Other income and expense consisted of net income of $71,757 in 2009 compared to a net expense of $1,490,821in 2008. The net expense in 2008 is primarily attributable to three items, 1) a one time impairment of goodwill relating to the merger in 1999 of SDS of $1,179,464, 2) decline in value of life insurance policies based on market fluctuation of $276,787 and 3) interest expense of $35,411. Income taxes for 2009 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.4%, compared to 5.9% in 2008. In 2009 our Net income was $251,588, or $.04 per diluted share as compared to 2008 with a net loss of $1,341,653, or ($.23) per diluted share. This Net loss includes a one time charge of $1,179,464 for goodwill impairment. Critical Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition The Company follows the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 for revenue recognition. In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of any agreement exists, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured, therefore, revenue is recognized when the Company invoices customers for completed services at contracted rates and terms. Other Income The most significant changes in other income were in the following areas. In 2001 North Carolina Premier purchased variable life insurance policies for its shareholders. In 2010 no premiums were paid, income of $37,371 was recorded as a result of the cash surrender value exceeding premiums, the cash surrender value equaled $407,403 on December 31, 2010. In 2009 no premiums were paid, income of $76,274 was recorded as a result of the increase in cash surrender value, the cash surrender value equaled $370,032. Net interest expense increased $55,141 from $12,232 in 2009 to $67,373 in 2010. Marketable securities are accounted for as trading securities and are stated at market value with unrealized gains and losses accounted for in net income before income taxes. In 2010 marketable securities were a gain of $828, as compared to a gain of $12,522 in 2009. Income Taxes Income taxes for 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.3%, compared to 31.4% in 2009. Property and Equipment Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost. We provide for depreciation on a straight-line basis over estimated useful life of five years (for computer equipment) and seven years (for furniture and fixtures). Business Combinations and Goodwill In 1999 the company merged Software Data Services into North Carolina Premier. The client base represented the most substantial asset acquired during the merger. An annual analysis of clients acquired and the annual billing are factors used to determine goodwill and impairment. The percentage of retained client billings (which remains significant) to the overall billing of the company and then compared to the value factor of the company. The value factor was calculated using the most recent share price as quoted on the OTC and the percentage of ownership represented by those shares to extrapolate a fair market value for the company as a whole. Based on these calculations, the value of the client base acquired and retained to that of the company as a whole are significantly higher then the value reported on the books and therefore no impairment has been recorded. 12 table of contents Purchased goodwill in the amount of $2,718,385 was being amortized over 15 years until December 31, 2001. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 2001 was $487,101. North Carolina Premier adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that all goodwill and indefinite life intangibles no longer be amortized. Goodwill must be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, an annual impairment test is performed under which the estimated fair value of goodwill is compared with its carrying value. On December 31, 2008 we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $1,179,464. This included a tax benefit of $27,000 for the impairment of tax deductible goodwill of $72,000. No goodwill impairment was recognized in 2009. We have completed our annual impairment evaluation for the year ended December 31, 2010, and have concluded that there is no goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 we have goodwill of $2,894,075 and $1,450,578. In September 2004, North Carolina Premier invested in Critical Analytics Inc, a company that is developing a unique trading platform for analysts, traders, and investors. The venture combines our software development and support strengths with the architectural and industry specific business knowledge of Critical Analytics. We own 350,000 shares of stock representing approximately a 35% ownership interest in Critical Analytics. We use the equity method for recording earnings and losses. We recorded a loss on this investment of $12,670 for 2010 as compared to a loss of $9, 607 for 2009. In October 2009, Premier completed an Asset Purchase of Peoplesource Inc. The client base and goodwill represented the most substantial assets acquired during the purchase. An annual analysis of clients acquired and the annual billing are factors used to determine goodwill and impairment. No impairment has been recorded as of December 31, 2010. In April 2010, Premier completed an Asset Purchase of Intronic Solutions Group LLC. The client base and goodwill represented the most substantial assets acquired during the purchase. An annual analysis of clients acquired and the annual billing are factors used to determine goodwill and impairment. No impairment has been recorded as of December 31, 2010. In August 2010, Premier completed a Merger with Q5Group Inc. and purchased all the shares of stock of Q5Group. The purchase included fixed assets in the amount of $25,562, other tangible assets of $407,693, net liabilities of $151,430, goodwill in the amount of $731,497 which included stock options which were valued at $67,800 using the black scholes method of valuation, intangibles in the amount of $100,000, non competition allocation of $57,500, and sign on bonuses of $57,500. The client base and goodwill represented the most substantial assets acquired during the purchase. An annual analysis of clients acquired and the annual billing are factors used to determine goodwill and impairment. No impairment has been recorded as of December 31, 2010. We own one unit of ownership (representing 3% of the entire ownership interest) in Sharon Road Properties LLC, the entity that owns the property where our offices are located. We purchased that unit for $100,000. We recognize income as we receive distributions. Executive Compensation Agreements We have executive compensation agreements with 3 original executives of Premier. We own three separate life insurance policies (Flexible Premium Multifunded Life), each with a face amount of $3,000,000. We pay all scheduled monthly premiums and retain all interests in each policy. If an insured employee were to die, we would pay the employee’s designated beneficiary an annual survivor’s benefit of $300,000 per year for 10 consecutive years after the employee’s death. Stock Option Plan We account for stock-based compensation using the provisions of SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock-based compensation expense in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the options. We have only awarded stock options since May 2008. We measure the fair value of restricted shares based upon the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards that vest in accordance with service conditions are amortized over their applicable vesting period using the straight-line method. The fair value of our stock option awards or modifications is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free rates and dividend yield. Due to the limited trading history of our common stock, expected stock price volatility for stock option grants prior to 2008 is based on an analysis of the actual realized historical volatility of our common stock. The expected volatility assumption for stock option grants or modifications during 2008 was based on actual historical volatility of our common stock from the period after our initial trading date on January 31, 2007 through May 2008. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus have assumed a 0% dividend yield. If our actual experience differs significantly from the 13 table of contents assumptions used to compute our stock-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little stock-based compensation cost. On May 16, 2008, 600,000 non-statutory stock options were granted to three officers and directors and no vesting was involved. The options have an exercise price of $0.75 per share and expire on May 16, 2018. The estimated fair value of the options of $50,700 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with the following assumptions: a risk free interest rate of 4.57 percent, an estimated volatility of 5.32 percent and no dividend yield. On June 1, 2010, 325,000 incentive stock options were granted to five employees and the options vest over one to four years. The options have an exercise price of $1.00 per share and expire on June 1, 2020. Compensation expense related to these options will be recognized as vested totaling $20,138 in 2011, $12,083 in 2012, $12.083 in 2013, and $8,054 in 2014. The Compensation expense totaling $52,358 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with the following assumptions: a risk free interest rate of 4.03 percent, an estimated volatility of 8.5 percent and no dividend yield. On September 1, 2010, the Board granted an aggregate of 250,000 incentive stock options to four Q5Group shareholders as part of the merger agreement. The options had no vesting schedule, are exercisable at $1.00 per share and expire on September 1, 2020. The estimated fair value of the options of $67,800 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with the following assumptions: a risk free interest rate of 3.35 percent, an estimated volatility of 9.2 percent and no dividend yield. In addition, 25,000 incentive stock options were also granted to the president of Q5Group. These options vest after 1 year and are exercisable at $1.00 per share and expire on September 1, 2020. The estimated fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option valuation method and assumptions above was $6,780, which will be recorded as compensation expense. On December 1, 2010, 225,000 incentive stock options were granted to three executives for personal guarantees of the company line of credit, and no vesting was involved. The options have an exercise price of $1.00 per share and expire on December 1, 2020. The Stock option expense totaling $19,643 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with the following assumptions: a risk free interest rate of 3.95 percent, an estimated volatility of 8.5 percent and no dividend yield. On December 31, 2010, 100,000 incentive stock options were granted to one executive and no vesting was involved. The options have an exercise price of $1.00 per share and expire on December 1, 2020. The compensation expense totaling $14,780 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with the following assumptions: a risk free interest rate of 4.13 percent, an estimated volatility of 8.6 percent and no dividend yield. On April 30, 2010 the Board granted an aggregate of 150,000 warrants to consultants. The warrants are exercisable at $0.77, and expire on April 30, 2015. The estimated fair value of the options of $40,920 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with the following assumptions: a risk free interest rate of 4.36 percent, an estimated volatility of 8.9 percent and no dividend yield. On December 1, 2010 the Board granted an aggregate of 70,000 warrants to a consultant. The warrants are exercisable at $1.00, and expire on December 1, 2015. The estimated fair value of the options of $1,134 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with the following assumptions: a risk free interest rate of 3.95 percent, an estimated volatility of 8.5 percent and no dividend yield. Employee Benefit Plan We have a 401(k) plan that covers substantially all employees. Plan participants can make voluntary contributions of up to 15% of compensation, subject to certain limitations, and we match a portion of employee contributions. Total contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $26,600 and $10,253 respectively, not including forfeitures that are applied to the contributions by the company. Financial Condition and Liquidity As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $404,588, a change of $404,588 from the prior year. We continue to use our revolving Line of Credit to fund operations and increased our end of year balance by $128,000 over the prior year balance. Net working capital at December 31, 2010, was $632,050, representing a increase of $509,985. Non current liabilities of $141,177 is made up of long term debt of $22,177 related to the purchase of equipment and the balance made up of deferred tax liability. Shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2010, was $4,613,674, which represented 66% of total assets. 14 table of contents During the year ended December 31, 2010, the net cash used by operating activities was $157,233 and was primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable of $795,000, prepaid expenses of $13,000, decreases in income taxes payable of $52,000 and income from change in value of derivatives of $15,000 offset by depreciation of $78,000, the issuance of stock warrants and stock options of $76,000, increases in tax deferred assets of $39,000, accounts payable of $388,000 and loss in equity-method investee of $12,000. Cash flows from investing activities used $556,000. Of that decrease, $217,000 was for the purchase of Q5 Group, $300,000 was for the purchase of Intronic Solutions Group, and $39,000 for the purchase of equipment. Financing activities provided $1,118,158 of cash in 2010. Of that increase, $128,000 was due to advances on our revolving line of credit, $840,000 was from the issuance of Class B Preferred Stock, $284,000 was from the issuance of convertible debentures, $104,000 was for additional payments due to People Source Inc. and the capital lease obligation of purchase of equipment. We borrow or repay the revolving debt as needed based upon our working capital obligation. We believe that internally generated funds, current cash on hand, and available borrowings under our revolving credit line will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Because of the nature of our business, we are able to monitor variable expenses tied to our revenue generation and we are able to manage and adjust our fixed costs based on overall profitability. The following table represents the company’s most liquid assets: 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 559,711 $ 0 Marketable securities 31,748 30,918 Officers life insurance cash surrender value 407,403 370,032 Investment in cost method investee 100,000 100,000 1,098,862 500,950 The company manages cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs. The company plans to use its available resources including any borrowing under its line of credit to invest in its operations. The company has entered into a loan agreement for a line of credit with a financial institution which provides credit to 75% of accounts receivable aged less than 90 days up to $1,500,000. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.75 percent with a 4% floor, payable monthly. Management believes cash flows generated from operations, along with current cash and investments as well as borrowing capacity under the line of credit should be sufficient to finance capital requirements required by operations. No additional requirements are anticipated. If new business opportunities do arise additional outside funding may be required. Outlook Major trends or issues that we must deal with involve the following: 1) consolidation of customer’s primary consulting lists and standardized pricing and 2) competitive nature of attracting knowledge based experts in our core areas of focus. Customers are consolidating their primary consulting lists to much smaller numbers of approved firms to work with while at the same time attempting to standardize pricing and have all the approved firms involved in more opportunities within the customer. The benefit of this is that in many cases, our pricing is being compared to large specialty and big 4 consulting firms, which is a competitive benefit for us based on our model. This focus by clients however, is opening up much more competition for engagements that in the past might not have been pursued by many of the competitors that are thrust into the forum now. We must continue to build our expertise to be competitive. With the pace of current regulatory and business change, attracting the proper talent is a key to future opportunity. Individuals that have experience or can mold their past experiences to current business times, especially as it relates to regulatory, compliance, or organizational effectiveness are in high demand by many firms. Premier Alliance Group has addressed these issues from 3 perspectives. First we have laid the foundation and made a shift of our core services from a pure technology focus to a complete business consulting focus. This shift has allowed us to reposition ourselves with our customers, promote our capabilities and Knowledge Based Expertise and increase our visibility with our customers, moving us to a value add provider for our customers. Secondly we have structured our organization with a Professional Services and Consulting division that work collaboratively. This allows us to promote the benefits of a focused professional service firm with the advantages of a consulting arm, which is a benefit to our customers and our employees. Lastly, we have changed our talent acquisition processes 15 table of contents to have a more focused approach to effectively identify, source, and qualify the KBE resources, create a pool of talent we can network and utilize, and ensure we are positioned for growth by building practice areas within the company. Our top priority is to broaden the range of services we offer by building “areas of business expertise and knowledge” and at the same time build a more geographically diverse client base. We believe that achieving this goal will require a combination of merger activity and organic growth. This will in part depend on continued improvement in the U.S. business market. In 2010, the Company completed two acquisitions with firms based in Kansas City, MO and San Diego, CA. These transactions contributed to a broader customer base crossing additional industries (engineering, technology, life sciences), better geographic coverage, added to our professional services strengths (GRC and F&A) and added more capabilities on the business development and fulfillment ends. Back office operations were successfully integrated 100% within 60 days from the transaction date with the rest of processes and roles integrated successfully by the end of December. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2010, our contractual obligations consisted of the following lease and contractual obligations: 2011 $347,889 2012 $170,263 The leases cover office premises and leased vehicles. Of these leases a total of $58,396 is allocated for vehicle leases and $432,145 is for office premises. Non-cancellable contracts with talent acquisition engines or search firms account for $26,856 of the obligations. We have a loan agreement for a line of credit with a financial institution that provides us with a maximum credit line of $1,500,000. The line of credit is due on demand. We may only borrow up to 75% of accounts receivable aged at 90 days or less. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.75%, payable monthly. In addition, the loan is collateralized by substantially all our assets and personal guarantees by three members of the executive management team. Outstanding borrowings under the loan agreement were $339,000 and $211000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements The Class A preferred stock accrues 8 percent per annum dividends on a stated “dividend value”. “Dividend value” is the amount equal to $0.98 per share of Class A preferred stock outstanding.

The warrants are immediately exercisable and have a term of five years Material Consulting Agreements In August 2009, we engaged Equity Source Partners as consultants and financial advisors to act as the exclusive financial advisor to the Company for the purpose of pursuing proposed capital. Fees related to any funding would include a cash fee equal to 8% of the gross proceeds received from the sale of securities and 5 year warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to 8% of the gross number of shares sold at each closing, or 8% of the number of shares of common stock the securities sold are convertible into in the event convertible debt or convertible preferred stock is sold. This agreement is ongoing. BUSIN ESS Corporate Information Premier Alliance Group, Inc. was incorporated on January 5, 2000 as Continuum Group C Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada (the “Company”). Prior to November 5, 2004 and since inception, we had not engaged in any business operations other than organizational activities; and other than issuing shares to our stockholders, we never commenced operational activities. On that date, we consummated a share exchange agreement dated as of October 12, 2004, among the Company, Premier Alliance Group, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (“North Carolina Premier”), and the shareholders of North Carolina Premier. As a result, North Carolina Premier merged with us and we changed our name to Premier Alliance Group, Inc. Our financial statements included in this report for periods prior to the merger are those of North Carolina Premier. Overview From 1995 until it merged with us, North Carolina Premier was a provider of information technology consulting services to businesses, primarily throughout the Southeast. The customer base includes businesses in the education, financial, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, professional service, retail, textile, transportation, and utility industries, as well as governmental agencies. Upon consummation of our share exchange with the shareholders of North Carolina Premier, we acquired North Carolina Premier’s business by acquiring North Carolina Premier itself; on merging North Carolina Premier into our company, we started conducting that business directly. Throughout the rest of “Description of Business,” the words “us,” “we,” and “our” refer to North Carolina Premier with respect to the period prior to the share exchange and refer to our company with respect to the subsequent period. Our business consists of providing professional services (business and technology consulting focused services) to our customers. Our services began a transformation in 2005 from a pure technology focus to a business consulting focus which can encompass technology impact and effort. Our consulting team provides deep business knowledge based expertise which helps our customers drive key initiatives forward. Much of our expertise is focused on core areas of business processes used throughout the corporate world including: project management, business analysis, business consulting, and strategic consulting. Typical initiatives in which we provide expertise include compliance and regulatory, merger and acquisition, and business process reengineering efforts. With technology being such an integral part of business, many of our consultants possess solid knowledge and experience that encompasses technology and are typically well versed in the IT business-solution software development life cycle. A typical customer is an organization with complex business processes, large amounts of data to manage, and changing business requirements. We promote our services through our two delivery channels, our Professional Services and Consulting divisions. These divisions operate as one from an accounting and overall management perspective; however they are differentiated from a marketing and customer presentation perspective only. Management reviews and oversees the divisions as one combined entity, utilizes resources across both areas, and makes operational assessments and plans together. In light of this, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131 “Business segments” does not require separate financial reporting and the two channels are consolidated in all financial report presentations. 17 table of contents Professional Services Division . This division provides Knowledge Based Expertise within focused areas of concentration. Our core areas of expertise in this group revolve around efforts in 1) Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC), 2) Business Performance & Technology (BP&T) and 3) Finance & Accounting (F&A). Types of engagements within this realm include: 1) GRC efforts with enterprise risk management, control and governance frameworks, internal audit services, regulatory and compliance, 2) BP&T efforts with systems planning, organizational effectiveness, business process re-engineering, workflow analysis, and 3) F&A efforts with financial reporting and financial advisory services. Engagements are typically structured in a Statement of Work and can be billed on fixed fee / delivery based arrangements or on a time-and-materials basis for all work performed. We are focused on providing Knowledge Based Expertise (KBE) and because of the expertise involved and the complexity of a typical initiative, customers seeking such services from us typically engage us on strategic or high priority initiatives. It is very common that we obtain contract extensions or work on additional efforts with our customers with our Professional Services division. Consulting Division . This division handles advanced technologies and business solutions and provides expertise in project management, systems implementation and architecture, information management, business intelligence, business expertise, analysis, and engineering. Its focus is to service customers on a time and material or project basis. The work is typically performed at our customer’s facilities and is delivered at the direction of the customer. Services provided by this group include helping customers assess their business needs and identifying the right technology or business solution, helping manage or implement methodologies, designing, architecting and constructing new systems and integrating them with the customer’s existing technology, assessing business workflow and process, and helping manage change. Recent Acquisitions. In October 2009, the Company completed an asset purchase of Peoplesource Inc, a Winston Salem, NC based organization. In April 2010 the Company completed an asset purchase of Intronic Solutions Group LLC, a Kansas City, MO based organization. In September 2010 the Company completed a merger with Q5Group, Inc, a San Diego based organization. These transactions have all contributed to a broader customer base, added industry exposure, better geographic coverage, deeper professional services strengths, and more capabilities on the business development and fulfillment ends. Back office operations were successfully integrated within 45 days of each transaction with the rest of processes and roles integrated successfully within 6 months of each transaction. We are continually seeking to expand our base and coverage, and accordingly, may seek out future acquisitions and/or mergers to pursue this strategy. Subsequent Developments. On March 3, 2011, the Company closed an agreement to issue and sell to two accredited investors an aggregate of 2,380,952 shares of our newly designated 7% $2.10 Series C Preferred Stock and 7,142,856 warrants to purchase common stock. The warrants are exercisable during the five-year period commencing on the date of issuance at $0.77 per share. Based on the purchase price of $5,000,000, the Company received gross proceeds of $5,000,000, paid cash commissions totaling $650,000, and issued 714,285 Warrants, for net cash proceeds of $4,350,000. Summary Our focus is to provide subject matter expertise through our consulting team in a variety of ways that continue to help our clients navigate the changing business climate they must deal with. Our approach is built 100% around our people - it is about knowledge, expertise and execution. We have a focus on building our knowledge practices with talent in core areas we feel offer opportunity: compliance/regulatory, merger and acquisition, and business process reengineering/analysis. Our recruiting and sales organization work with customers closely - a consultative approach - to understand the business direction, initiatives or issues they are dealing with. It is our focus to then provide subject matter experts that can bring the expertise and knowledge to the client to allow for successful efforts. If, as we expect, we continue to grow and attract specialized expertise in our focused areas of discipline, we will continue to be recognized as a value add partner for existing customers, add new customers, and will identify opportunities to provide additional value add services to our customers. Our typical customers have historically been Fortune 500 companies (including AIG, Lincoln Financial Group, Duke Power, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo), and they continually seek expertise and knowledge in areas such as project management, business consulting, and business analysis. With our recent acquisitions we are now better positioned and also successfully servicing the emerging business and mid market arena, especially as it relates to life sciences, biotech and technology focused companies. In delivering our services, Premier Alliance Group has 5 key functional areas or groups that ensure delivery and support our Professional Services and Consulting divisions: (a) Talent Acquisition - sources and identifies the business and consulting staff we hire; (b) Business Development - works with our customers in a consultative approach to identify opportunities where we can assist and provide our services; 18 table of contents (c) Operations - provides the day to day support of the consulting staff in the field as well as all back office functions (HR, finance); (d) Professional Services – our knowledge based experts, works with our customers on strategic and complex issues (d) Consultants – these are our knowledge based experts and professionals that deliver to our customers. Talent Acquisition Our success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified employees. Our recruiting team contacts prospective employment candidates by telephone, through postings on the internet, and by means of our internal recruiting software and databases. For internet postings, we maintain our own web page at www.premieralliance.com and use other internet job-posting bulletin board services as well as professional and social networking sites. We use a sophisticated computer application as our central repository to track applicants’ information, manage skills verification, background checks, etc. and then match them with potential customer opportunities. We only hire candidates after they have gone through a rigorous qualification process involving multiple interviews and repeated screening. Business Development Our business development team is our primary interface with the customer, prior to delivery. They develop and maintain business relationships by building knowledge on our client businesses, technical environments and strategic direction. Our business development team uses the same central repository system as recruiting, this links recruiter information with customer information to manage our process efficiently and effectively. Operations Our operations team encompasses several core functions within the company (Human resources and Finance). Encompassed in HR is our employee relations function, this provides primary support and service for our consultants on a daily basis, which is critical. This support ensures regular interaction and information sharing leading to quality services, better retention, and successful delivery to our client. Within HR we also have the standard human resource functions (benefit administration, payroll, background processing). Finance provides all financial processing - billing, AP, AR, and SEC reporting. Competition The market for professional services is highly competitive. It is also highly fragmented, with many providers and no single competitor maintaining clear market leadership. Our competition varies by location, type of service provided, and the customer to whom services are provided. Our competitors fall into four categories: large national or international vendors; software vendors and suppliers of packaged software systems; small regional consulting firms, and internal technology staff at our customers and potential customers. As a professional service firm with a focus on providing business expertise and talent our customers can group us with IT staffing firms for procurement purposes. We believe that to compete successfully, we must differentiate ourselves from the glut of technology “staffing” firms by providing expertise that encompass business and process knowledge first and technology capabilities second. This approach is truly recognized as providing expertise and value to the customer and can have a very positive impact on our relationship with the customers as well as alter the procurement process (in a positive manner) that we engage with to service our customers. When servicing our customers today, Premier typically signs master contracts for a one to three year period. The contracts typically set rules of engagement and can include pricing guidelines. The contracts manage the relationship and are not indicators of guaranteed work. Individual contracts are put in place (under the master agreement) for each consultant assigned to the client site and cover logistics of length of contract and bill rate per hour for the particular assignment. In most cases contracts can be terminated with a notice of 10 to 30 days. Legal Proceedings As of December 31, 2010, and as of the date of this filing, we are not a party to any pending or threatened legal proceeding. 19 table of contents Properties Our practice is to lease commercial office space for all of our offices. Our headquarters are located in a modern four-story building in Charlotte, North Carolina. We lease approximately 5200 square feet of space at that location, under a lease that will expire in August 2012. In addition we have offices in: 1. Winston Salem, North Carolina - we lease approximately 2000 square feet, under a lease that will expire in December 2010. 2. Kansas City, Missouri – we lease approximately 1400 square feet, under a lease that will expire in April 30, 2012. 3. San Diego, California – we lease approximately 2175 square feet, under a lease that will expire in December 31, 2012 4. Los Angeles, California – we lease approximately 1656 square feet, under a lease that will expire in March 31, 2012. Most of these facilities serve as sales and support offices and vary in size, depending on the number of people employed at that office. Our lease terms vary from periods of less than a year to three years and generally have flexible renewal options. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current needs.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Compensation Discussion and Analysis The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is charged with administering our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee evaluates the performance and, based on such evaluation, sets the compensation of our CEO/President and other executive officers and administers our equity compensation plans. 21 table of contents Executive Compensation Policy The objectives of our executive compensation programs are to: · Attract, retain and motivate key executive personnel who possess the skills and qualities to perform successfully in the business and technology consulting industries and achieve our objective of maximizing stockholder value; · Closely align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders; · Provide a total compensation opportunity that is competitive with our market for executive talent; and · Align our executives’ compensation to our Company’s operating performance with performance-based compensation that will provide actual compensation above the market median when the Company delivers strong financial performance and below the market median when performance is not strong. While we compete for talent with companies across all industries and sectors, we primarily focus on professional services companies in the business and technology consulting industries. While we often compete for talent outside this market, these companies define our market for compensation purposes. The Compensation Committee reviews data from these companies, along with other data as it deems appropriate, to determine market compensation levels from time to time and also can seek advice from outside compensation consultants. Compensation Components The Compensation Committee primarily uses a combination of base salary, discretionary bonuses and long-term incentive programs to compensate our executive officers. Each element aligns the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders by focusing on both our short-term and long-term performance. Base Salaries . We are committed to retaining talented executives capable of diverse responsibilities and, as a result, believe base salaries for executives should be maintained at rates at or slightly ahead of market rates. The Compensation Committee assesses base salaries for each position, based on the value of the individual’s experience, performance and/or specific skill set, in the ordinary course of business, but generally not less than once each year as part of our budget determination process. Other than market adjustments that may be required from time to time, the Compensation Committee believes annual merit percentage increases for executives, if any, should generally not exceed, in any year, the average merit increase percentage earned by our non-executives. The base salaries received by the executive team have not been adjusted in fiscal 2010. Discretionary Annual Bonuses . The Compensation Committee has the authority to award discretionary annual cash or share bonuses to our executive officers based on individual and Company performance. We believe these bonuses are an important tool in motivating and rewarding the performance of our executive officers. Performance-based cash incentive compensation is expected to be paid to our executive officers based on individual and/or overall performance standards. No discretionary bonuses for the executive management team were issued in 2010. Long-Term Incentives . The Compensation Committee also believes that a portion of each executive’s annual total compensation should be a long-term incentive, both to align each executive with the interests of our stockholders and also to provide a retention incentive. The Compensation Committee approved our 2008 Stock Incentive Plan in May 2008 and received shareholder approval in the 2009 (the “Plan”). As of December 31, 2010, 1,150,000 stock options have been granted to executives under the Plan. The Summary Compensation Table below details the stock options granted to executives under the Plan since 2009. The following table sets forth the information as to compensation paid to or earned by our Chief Executive Officer and our two other most highly compensated executive officers during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. These individuals are referred to in this proxy statement as our named executive officers. As none of our named executive officers received any stock awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, or nonqualified deferred compensation earnings during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have omitted those columns from the table. 22 table of contents SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE Name and Principal Position Year Salary Bonus($) Option Awards (1) Other Compensation (2) Total Compensation Mark S.

DESCRI PTION OF SECURITIES The following description of our capital stock being registered herein is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are included as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 of this registration statement. Common Stock We are authorized to issue up to 45,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters voted on by stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of our common stock do not have any conversion, redemption or preemptive rights. In the event of our dissolution, liquidation or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in any assets remaining after the satisfaction in full of the prior rights of creditors and the aggregate liquidation preference of any preferred stock then outstanding. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future. 29 table of contents Preferred Stock We are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. We may issue any class of preferred stock in any series. Our board of directors has the authority to establish and designate series, and to fix the number of shares included in each such series and the variations in the relative rights, preferences and limitations as between series, provided that, if the stated dividends and amounts payable on liquidation are not paid in full, the shares of all series of the same class shall share ratably in the payment of dividends including accumulations, if any, in accordance with the sums which would be payable on such shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full, and in any distribution of assets other than by way of dividends in accordance with the sums which would be payable on such distribution if all sums payable were discharged in full. Shares of each series when issued shall be designated to distinguish the shares of each series from shares of all other series. All outstanding shares of our preferred stock are fully paid and non-assessable. We have designated 2,500,000 shares of our authorized preferred stock as Series C Preferred Stock and 2,000,000 shares as Series B Preferred Stock. Although shares of common stock underlying our Series C Preferred Stock are being registered herein, our Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are not being registered herein. A brief description of the terms and conditions of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock is provided above under “Selling Stockholders – The March Placement and The Unit Placement”. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. P LAN OF DISTRIBUTION Each selling stockholder of the common stock and any of their donees, pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A selling stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares: • ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers; • block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction; • purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account; • an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; • privately negotiated transactions; • settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part; • broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; • through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; • a combination of any such methods of sale; or • any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus. Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an 30 table of contents agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with NASDR Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with NASDR IM-2440. In connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares of the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Each Selling Stockholder has informed the Company that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the Common Stock. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups that, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%). The Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the registration of the shares. The Company has agreed to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus that qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. There is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the Selling Stockholders. We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares may be resold by the Selling Stockholders without registration and without regard to any volume limitations by reason of Rule 144(b) under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to this Prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with. Under applicable rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of the common stock by the Selling Stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act). L EGAL MATTERS Law Offices of Michael H. Freedman, PLLC, 394 White Birch Lane, Jericho, New York 11753 will deliver an opinion that the issuance of the shares covered by this prospectus has been approved by our Board of Directors and that such shares, when issued, will be fully paid and non-assessable under Nevada law.

Charlotte, North Carolina INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Premier Alliance Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Premier Alliance Group, Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal controls over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Premier Alliance Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 Note 1 - Organization and Business: Premier Alliance Group, Inc. (“Old Premier”) was organized under the laws of North Carolina in June 1995. Old Premier provided information technology solution and consulting services to customers operating in a variety of industries throughout the United States. On November 5, 2004, Old Premier and its shareholders consummated a share exchange agreement with Premier Alliance Group, Inc. (the “Company”). The Company was an inactive public company that was organized in Nevada in January 2000. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, shareholders of Old Premier were issued 36,176,863 shares of common stock and 4,323,157 shares of Class A convertible preferred stock in exchange for all of their outstanding common stock and preferred stock in Old Premier. As a result of the share exchange agreement, the shareholders of Old Premier acquired a majority (90%) of the issued and outstanding common and preferred stock of the merged company. For accounting purposes, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. Old Premier was merged into the Company and immediately after the merger the Company was renamed Premier Alliance Group, Inc. The Company accounted for the share exchange using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141 “Business Combinations”. The Company did not record any amount for goodwill on the share exchange. Acquisitions: On October 1, 2009, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Peoplesource, Inc., a North Carolina corporation pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated September 18, 2009. In consideration of the purchased assets, including service contracts and office equipment, the Company agreed to pay 153,846 shares of common stock, equal to $100,000 at the closing date and an estimated $400,000 in cash over two years ($140,000 after closing, $120,000 thirteen months from closing, and the balance 24 months from closing). The total consideration, including value of stock, is calculated as the gross revenue from Peoplesource, Inc.’s unit during the first year after acquisition multiplied by 25 percent.

Amounts invested may exceed federally insured limits at any given time. As a result of the Company’s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances. Such negative balances are included in trade accounts payable and totaled $0 and $61,481 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accounts receivable: The Company considers accounts receivable to be fully collectible. If amounts become uncollectible, they are charged to operations when that determination is made. Marketable securities: Marketable equity securities are accounted for as trading securities and are stated at market value with unrealized gains and losses accounted for in current income from operations. Property and equipment: Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to seven years. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains or losses on dispositions are reflected in income. Property and equipment includes equipment under capital leases of $35,469, and $0, respectively at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Amounts included on the balance sheet under capital leases are net of accumulated depreciation of $1,182 and $0, respectively. Goodwill and intangible assets: Purchased goodwill in the amount of $2,718,385 was being amortized over 15 years until December 31, 2001. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 2001 was $487,101. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill in accordance with FASB SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually. No impairment losses were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Acquired intangible assets consist of customer relationships and non-competition agreements. The fair market value of the customer relationships were determined by discounting the expected future cash flows from the acquired customers. The value of the non-competition agreements were estimated based off of the percentage of discounted cash flows expected to be lost if the agreement was not in place. The $452,000 of customer relationships acquired are being amortized over the estimated useful life of five years. The $57,500 of non-competition agreements are being amortized over the life of the agreement. At December 31, 2010, accumulated amortization on intangible assets totaled $69,791. The amortization expense on these intangible assets of $65,591 and $4,200 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is included under depreciation and amortization on the statement of operations. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is expected to be as follows for the years ended: December 31, 2011 $ 101,900 December 31, 2012 101,900 December 31, 2013 101,900 December 31, 2014 97,700 December 31, 2015 36,309 $ 439,709 (F10) Revenue recognition: The Company follows the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 for revenue recognition. In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of any agreement exists, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured, therefore, revenue is recognized when the Company invoices customers for completed services at contracted rates and terms. Income taxes: Effective with the conversion to a C Corporation, the Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes”. Under FASB ASC Topic 740-10-30, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be removed or settled (see Note 12). The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740. FASB ASC Topic 740-10 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the balance sheet. It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement and classification of amounts related to uncertain tax positions, accounting for and disclosure of interest and penalties, accounting in interim period disclosures and transition relating to the adoption of new accounting standards. Under FASB ASC Topic 740-10, the recognition for uncertain tax positions should be based on a more-likely-than-not threshold that the tax position will be sustained upon audit. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent probability of being realized upon settlement. Use of accounting estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosures. Accordingly, the actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Any adjustments applied to estimated amounts are recognized in the year in which such adjustments are determined. Fair value of financial instruments: The Company’s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and credit facilities. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the Company’s notes payable and long-term debt, estimated based on the current borrowing rates available to the Company, approximates the carrying value of these liabilities. The Company did not have any outstanding financial derivative instruments. Derivative instruments: The Company records derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”. Certain warrants issued by the Company are considered derivative instruments due to their full-ratchet anti-dilution protection. For these transactions, a derivative liability is booked for the fair market value of the warrants at the date of issuance and changes in the fair market value of the warrants are recorded as derivative income in the statement of operations. See Note 13 for further discussion. (F11) Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. Subsequent events: The Company evaluated all events and transactions through March 28, 2011, the date these financial statements were issued. Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company closed an agreement to issue and sell to two accredited investors an aggregate of 2,380,952 shares of the Company’s newly designated 7% $2.10 Series C Preferred Stock and 7,142,856 warrants to purchase common stock. The Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $2.10. The warrants are exercisable during the five-year period commencing on the date of issuance at $0.77 per share. Based on the purchase price of $5,000,000, the Company received gross proceeds of $5,000,000, paid cash commissions totaling $650,000, and issued 714,285 warrants, for net cash proceeds of $4,350,000. Recent accounting pronouncements: Since January 1, 2009, there have been several new accounting pronouncements and updates to the Accounting Standards Codification. Each of these updates has been reviewed by Management who does not believe their adoption has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or operating results. Note 3 - Property and Equipment: The principal categories and estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows: Estimated 2010 2009 Useful Lives Office equipment $ 370,483 $ 293,846 5 years Furniture and fixtures 63,247 55,175 7 years Computer software 17,100 17,100 3 years 450,830 366,121 Less: accumulated depreciation (367,003 ) (354,393 ) $ 83,827 $ 11,728 (F12) Note 4 - Marketable Securities Classified as Trading Securities: Under FASB ASC Topic 320-10-25 “Investments-Debt and Equity Securities”, securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term (thus held only for a short time) are classified as trading securities. Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling, and trading securities are generally used with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in price. All inputs used to value the securities are based on Level 1 inputs under FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”. The unrealized holding loss as of December 31, 2010, is as follows: Fair Market Cost Value Holding Loss Equity Investments $ 46,092 $ 31,748 $ 14,344 The unrealized holding loss as of December 31, 2009, is as follows: Fair Market Cost Value Holding Loss Equity Investments $ 46,092 $ 30,918 $ 15,174 Note 5 - Investment in Equity-Method Investee: In 2004, the Company invested $250,000 for a 33 percent ownership of Critical Analytics, Inc. Critical Analytics, Inc. is in the business of software development and financial consulting services. In January 2007, the Company’s ownership percentage increased to 35 percent. The Company accounts for this investment using the equity method. The Company records its proportionate share of income or loss from Critical Analytics, Inc.’s results of operations; correspondingly, the carrying amount of the investment is increased by equity in earnings and reduced by equity in losses. During 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded losses of $12,670 and $9,607 as its equity in Critical Analytics, Inc., respectively. Summarized financial information of Critical Analytics, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: 2010 2009 Assets: Current assets $ 182,316 $ 220,003 Property and equipment – net 54,926 55,796 $ 237,242 $ 275,799 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity: Current liabilities $ 614 $ 1,160 Stockholders’ equity 236,628 274,639 $ 237,242 $ 275,799 Gross revenue $ 0 $ 0 Other income 576 20,718 Operating expenses (38,586 ) (49,538 ) Net loss $ (38,010 ) $ (28,820 ) (F13) Note 6 - Investment in Limited Liability Company: The Company has an investment in a limited liability company, which owns approximately 33 percent of the office building that the Company leases office space from in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Company’s investment represents an approximate 3 percent share of ownership in the limited liability company. Because the limited liability company interest does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company accounts for its investment using the cost method. Accordingly, the carrying value of $100,000 is equal to the capital contribution the Company has made. Income is recognized when capital distributions are received by the Company and totaled $4,800 and $4,800 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Note 7 - Goodwill Impairment: The Company completed an annual impairment evaluation for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and recorded no impairment losses.

These warrants contained a beneficial conversion feature valued at $273,663, which was recorded as a deemed dividend to preferred shareholders. Additionally, 158,940 warrants were issued as commission on the sale of these securities. As discussed in the convertible debentures section of this note, 500,000 warrants were issued with convertible debentures. The following represents the activity of warrants as of December 31, 2010, and changes during the year: Options Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 1, 2010 0 0 Issued 1,778,940 $ 0.78 Outstanding at December 31, 2010 1,778,940 $ 0.78 Convertible Debentures and Derivative Liability: On May 21, 2010, the Company issued a 9 percent senior secured convertible debenture in the principal amount of $350,000 with an 8 percent original issue discount of $28,000 (the “Debenture”). Interest is payable monthly. Beginning January 2011, monthly principal payments of $17,500 are due. The remaining balance at November 2011 of $175,000 is due in full. The debenture is convertible at a conversion value of $0.70 per share. The Debenture was issued with 500,000 detachable warrants with an exercise price of $0.77 and expire in five years and contain full-ratchet and other standard anti-dilution protections. The Debenture is subordinate to the Company’s line of credit, and is secured by all the Company’s assets. In connection with the Debenture issuance, the Company issued the debenture holder 40,000 shares of common stock for $40 and paid a commitment fee of $20,000. Legal fees associated with the transaction totaled $18,000. (F18) The Company has accounted for these transactions in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-20 “Debt with Conversion and Other Options”. Due to the full-ratchet anti-dilution protection in the warrants, they are considered to be derivative instruments. As such, the fair market value of the warrants of $86,950 was recorded as a debt discount and as a derivative liability. Additional debt discounts included the original issue discount of $28,000, a commitment fee of $20,000, stock issue discount of $31,960, and a beneficial conversion feature of $183,090. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was calculated as the difference between the fair value of the Debenture if converted on the commitment date and the effective conversion price as stated in the debenture. The discounts totaling $350,000 are being amortized under the interest method over the term of the debenture and being recorded as interest expense.

II-1 Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. The following is a summary of sales of our securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) during the last three years. In August 2009, we issued an aggregate of 50,000 shares to Cary Sucoff and Francis Anderson, pursuant to a consulting agreement with Equity Source Partners, a registered broker-dealer, as compensation for consulting services rendered. The shares of common stock were issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

The shares of common stock were issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. In April 2010, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Intronic Solutions Group, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“Intronic”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement.

The warrants are exercisable at $0.77 per shares and were issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. In May 2010, we sold to a certain accredited investor a $350,000 9% Secured Convertible Note (the “Note”), and (b) share purchase warrants.

We received gross proceeds from the sale of the Note and warrants of $322,000, including the original issue discount, and paid $10,500 in commissions for net proceeds of $311,500.

In June and December 2010, respectively, we closed two private placements and sold an aggregate of 15 units of our securities. Each unit consisted of 80,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock and 60,000 warrants.

II-3 Item 17. Undertakings The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: (a)(1) To file, during any period in which it offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a) (3) of the Securities Act; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective Registration Statement; and (iii) To include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the Registration Statement or any material change to such information in the Registration Statement. Provided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement or are contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the Registration Statement. (2) For determining liability under the Securities Act, to treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement relating to the securities then being offered, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering of such securities. (3) To file a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser: If the undersigned Registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of this Registration Statement, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the Registration Statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness; provided , however , that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the Registration Statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the Registration Statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (b) The undersigned hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the Registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other that the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
