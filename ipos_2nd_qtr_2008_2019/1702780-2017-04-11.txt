Overview Altice USA is one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers in the United States. We deliver broadband, pay television, telephony services, Wi-Fi hotspot access, proprietary content and advertising services to approximately 4.9 million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich broadband network with more than 8.5 million homes passed as of December 31, 2016. As the U.S. business of Altice N.V., we are driven at all levels by the "Altice Way"our founder-inspired owner-operator culture and strategy of operational efficiency, innovation and long-term value creation for stockholders. In developing and implementing our strategy, we are focused on the following principles, which are part of the Altice Way:  Simplify and optimize our organization through streamlining business processes, centralizing functions and eliminating non-essential operating expenses and service arrangements.  Reinvest in infrastructure and content , including upgrading our HFC network and building out a FTTH network to strengthen our infrastructure capabilities and competitiveness.  Invest in sales, marketing and innovation , including brand-building, enhancing our sales channels and automating provisioning and installation processes.  Enhance the customer experience by offering a technologically advanced customer platform combined with superior connectivity and service across the customer lifecycle.  Drive revenue and cash flow growth through cross-selling, market share gains, new product launches and improvements in our operating and capital efficiency. We believe the Altice Way, which has been successfully implemented across Altice Group, distinguishes us from our U.S. industry peers and competitors. We acquired Cequel Corporation ("Suddenlink" or "Cequel") on December 21, 2015 and Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Optimum" or "Cablevision") on June 21, 2016. These acquisitions are referred to throughout this prospectus as the "Suddenlink Acquisition" (or the "Cequel Acquisition") and the "Optimum Acquisition (or the "Cablevision Acquisition"), respectively, and collectively as the "Acquisitions." We serve our customers through two business segments: Optimum, which operates in the New York metropolitan area, and Suddenlink, which principally operates in markets in the south-central United States. We have made significant progress in integrating the operations of Optimum and Suddenlink and are already realizing the operational and commercial benefits of common ownership and one management team as we implement the Altice Way throughout our organization. 1 Table of Contents We are a majority-owned and controlled U.S. subsidiary of Altice N.V., the multinational cable, fiber, telecommunications, content, media and advertising company founded and controlled by communications and media entrepreneur Patrick Drahi. Our management team benefits from Altice Group's experience in implementing the Altice Way around the world. Mr. Drahi, who has over 25 years of experience owning and managing communications and media operations, has built Altice Group from a regional French cable company founded in 2002 into one of the world's leading broadband communications and video services companies. Over the past 15 years, he has led a transformation of the broadband communications and video services industry through investment in networks and improvements in customer experience and operations to enhance both service delivery and operational efficiency. As of December 31, 2016, Altice Group delivered broadband, pay television and telephony services to more than 50 million customers in Western Europe, the United States, Israel and the Caribbean and reported pro forma consolidated revenue of €23.5 billion and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of €8.9 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Upon the completion of this offering, Altice N.V. and an entity controlled by Patrick Drahi will own % of our outstanding shares in the form of Class B common stock, which will represent % of the voting power of our issued and outstanding common stock. In early 2015, Altice N.V. made the strategic decision to invest in operations in the United States, the country with the largest broadband communications and video services market in the world. Altice N.V. believed that by employing the Altice Way, it could significantly improve upon the historical growth rates, profitability and operational efficiency of broadband communications and video services companies operating in this market. The following attractive market characteristics underpinned Altice N.V.'s U.S. investment thesis:  favorable demographics supporting underlying market growth;  demand for higher-speed broadband services;  demand for more advanced customer platforms and user interfaces;  opportunities to enhance operational efficiency and reduce overhead; and  opportunities for further industry consolidation. Following the Acquisitions, we began employing the Altice Way to simplify our organizational structure, reduce management layers, streamline decision-making processes and redeploy resources with a focus on network investment, customer service enhancements and marketing support. As a result, we have made significant progress in integrating the operations of Optimum and Suddenlink, centralizing our business functions, reorganizing our procurement processes, eliminating duplicative management functions, terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and third-party service arrangements, and investing in our employee relations and our culture. Improved operational efficiency has allowed us to redeploy physical, technical and financial resources towards upgrading our network and enhancing the customer experience to drive customer growth. This focus is demonstrated by reduced network outages since the Acquisitions, which we believe improves the consistency and quality of the customer experience. In addition, we have expanded, and intend to continue expanding, our e-commerce channels for sales and marketing. Since the Acquisitions, we have also upgraded our networks to nearly triple the maximum available broadband speeds we are offering to our Optimum customers and expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 60% of our Suddenlink footprint, compared to approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. In addition, we have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We believe this FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements, fewer service outages and lower power usage, which we expect will drive further cost efficiencies in our business. In order to further enhance the customer experience, we plan to introduce a new home communications hub during the second quarter of 2017. Our new 2 Table of Contents home communications hub will be an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet router and cable modem in one device, and will be the most advanced home communications hub offered by any Altice Group business. We are also beginning to offer managed data and communications services to our business customers and more advanced advertising services, such as targeted multi-screen advertising and data analytics, to our advertising and other business clients. Many of our initiatives have already resulted in a positive impact to our customer relationships, which grew by % from March 31, 2016 (on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Optimum Acquisition) to March 31, 2017. Our Competitive Strengths We believe the following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us for future growth and strong financial performance. Our Owner-Operator Culture We are part of a founder-controlled organization with an owner-operator culture and strategy that is focused on operational efficiency, innovation and long-term value creation for stockholders. This focus is reinforced by a system that delivers a substantial portion of management compensation in the form of long-term equity awards. Since the Acquisitions, our management team has moved quickly to, among other things, simplify and redesign our product offerings, drive adoption of higher broadband speeds and begin building a new FTTH network. We continuously challenge ourselves to improve our operational and financial performance. We encourage communication across the organization while empowering nimble, efficient decision-making that is focused at every level on enhancing the overall customer experience. We believe our owner-operator culture and the Altice Way differentiate us and position us to outperform our U.S. industry peers. We further believe the benefits of the Altice Way have been demonstrated by Altice N.V.'s performance, which is reflected in the 42% average annual total return of Altice N.V.'s Class A ordinary shares since its initial public offering in January 2014 through March 31, 2017, compared to the 5% average annual total return of the STOXX Europe 600 Telecommunications Index, of which Altice N.V.'s Class A ordinary shares is a component, during the same time period. Leading Position in Attractive Markets The markets served by our broadband networks have generally experienced higher levels of disposable income and household density compared to other broadband communications and video services markets in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 75% of the homes passed by our network were in either the New York metropolitan area or Texas. The following table provides a comparison of management's estimate of income and density metrics for our markets to both our largest U.S. publicly-traded industry peers as well as the national averages. Altice USA Charter Communications Comcast Cable One U.S. National Median 2016 Household Median Income (in thousands) $ 86 $ 63 $ 72 $ 59 $ 66 Housing Units per Square Mile as of April 1, 2010 based on most recent U.S. census data 668 99 119 24 37 3 Table of Contents The footprint of our Optimum network includes New York City, the world's largest media and entertainment market as measured by 2014 revenue. This network represents our largest cluster of cable and fiber network systems. As of December 31, 2016, this network passed approximately 5.1 million homes and provided broadband, pay television and telephony services to approximately 3.1 million unique residential and business customers, representing approximately 64% of our entire customer base. We believe our leading market demographics support revenue growth potential in terms of customer additions and increased ARPU. We believe the market density of the New York metropolitan area allows our Optimum segment to operate with greater capital efficiency and lower capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue than our U.S. industry peers. Our presence in this market and its high-profile customer base also gives us access to a large and valuable base of advertisers, advertising inventory and advertising data, each of which supports growth prospects for our advertising business. The footprint of our Suddenlink network includes markets in Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona, California, Missouri and eight other states. As of December 31, 2016, this network passed approximately 3.4 million homes and provided broadband, pay television and telephony services to approximately 1.8 million unique residential and business customers, representing approximately 36% of our customer base. We believe less than 15% of our Suddenlink footprint currently faces competition from broadband communications and video services providers offering download speeds comparable to our fastest offered speeds. In addition, household penetration of residential broadband connections with speeds of at least 25 Mbps in these markets was less than 34% in 2015 compared to approximately 44% nationwide, as estimated by management, providing us with attractive future growth opportunities. As a result, we believe Suddenlink's markets are among the most attractive broadband communications and video services markets in the United States. Advanced Network and Customer Platform Technologies Technological innovation and network investments are key components of the Altice Way. Substantially all of our HFC network is digital video and DOCSIS 3.0 compatible, with approximately 300 homes per node and a bandwidth capacity of at least 750 MHz throughout. This network allows us to provide our customers with advanced broadband, pay television and telephony services. In addition, we believe our Optimum footprint offers the densest Wi-Fi network among our U.S. industry peers as measured by the number of Wi-Fi hotspots per broadband subscriber. Since the Acquisitions, we have nearly tripled the maximum available broadband speeds we are offering to our Optimum customers from 101 Mbps to 300 Mbps for residential customers and 350 Mbps for business customers and have expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 60% of our Suddenlink footprint from approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. Our advanced network has contributed to our revenue growth by allowing us to meet market demand for increasingly faster speeds. The chart below illustrates the significant increase in the 4 Table of Contents percentage of our new residential customers choosing service plans with speeds greater than or equal to 100 Mbps since the Acquisitions. To position us to satisfy anticipated market demand for increasing speeds and support evolving technologies, such as the expected transition of mobile networks to 5G, and to enable us to capture associated revenue growth opportunities, we have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network that will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We also plan to introduce a new home communications hub during the second quarter of 2017, which will be the most advanced home communications hub offered by any Altice Group business. This new hub will be an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet router and cable modem in one device. It is based on LaBox, a home communications hub Altice Group has successfully deployed in France, the Dominican Republic and Israel, and will be initially offered to customers subscribing to our triple product packages. It will be capable of delivering broadband, Wi-Fi, pay television services, OTT services and fixed-line telephony and will support 4K video and a remote DVR. We intend to continue enhancing the features and functionality of our new home communications hub after its initial introduction. We believe the development of our advanced network and new home communications hub epitomizes the engineering and innovation-centric ethos within Altice Group. Customer-Centric Operating and Service Model Supported by Technology and Data Analytics We seek to provide our customers with the best connectivity and service experience available. This customer-centric approach drives our decision-making processes and is another key component of the Altice Way. Through investments in our information technology ("IT") platforms and a focus on process improvement, we have simplified and harmonized our service offering bundles, and improved our technical service delivery and our customer service. We are investing in our sales channels, including enhancing our e-commerce channels in response to customer behavior. While inbound sales remain the largest sales channel for each of Optimum and Suddenlink, our e-commerce channels' share of new sales has grown substantially since the Acquisitions. We develop, monitor and analyze detailed customer metrics to identify root-causes of customer dissatisfaction and to further improve the customer experience. Taken together, we believe these initiatives will further reduce calls and service visits, increase customer satisfaction and strengthen our top-line performance and cash flow generation. 5 Table of Contents Benefits of a Global Communications Group Unlike most of our U.S. industry peers, we benefit from being part of an international media and communications group. As the U.S. business of Altice N.V., we have access to the innovation, management expertise and best practices developed and tested in other Altice Group markets such as France, Portugal, the Dominican Republic and Israel. For example, our new home communications hub will be based on LaBox, which was developed by Altice Labs, Altice N.V.'s technology, services and operations innovation center, and our FTTH network build-out will leverage Altice Labs' technology and expertise developed for the deployment of GPON technology in Altice Group's fiber networks. Our B2B service offerings draw from platforms, services and expertise developed by sophisticated B2B operators across the Altice Group footprint such as Portugal Telecom in Portugal and SFR in France. We also benefit from Altice Group's significant scale advantages, allowing us to draw on centralized functions, including procurement and technical services. In addition, Altice Group operates converged networks, including wireless operations in markets outside the United States. We believe these scale benefits and operational expertise assist us in increasing our operating efficiency and reducing our capital expenditures while also improving the customer experience. Altice Group also cross-deploys talent and expertise across its businesses, allowing us to benefit from our senior management's experience in successfully implementing the Altice Way around the world. We believe this diversity of experience differentiates us from our more traditional U.S.-centric industry peers. Strategic Focus on Operational Efficiency An important principle of the Altice Way is leveraging operational efficiency in order to invest in network improvements and increase returns. We believe our focus on simplifying customer service offerings and streamlining and improving our operations through an intense focus on efficiency is unmatched by our U.S. industry peers. We continuously strive to remove unnecessary management layers, streamline decision-making processes, trim excess costs and question whether our current methodologies are indeed the most efficient. For example, the home installation, repair, outside plant maintenance and network construction elements of our business have been reorganized under Altice Technical Services ("ATS"), Altice N.V.'s services organization in the United States. We believe this reorganization will allow us to focus on our core competencies and realize operational cost efficiencies. The financial resources created by these strategies allow us to invest in network improvements and customer experience enhancements. We believe the operating and financial benefits that result from our focus on operational efficiency will continue to give us a competitive advantage against our competitors and U.S. industry peers. Powerful Financial Model Driving Strong Returns We believe the benefits of the Altice Way have already significantly strengthened our financial performance and will continue to do so, allowing us to deliver strong returns. Our revenue growth for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was % as compared to pro forma revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We believe we can continue growing our revenue by increasing market penetration of our services (particularly broadband), driving continued growth in B2B services, launching new services, gaining market share from competitors due to the high quality and value of our services and leveraging improved customer satisfaction to sell additional services. We believe we are one of the most profitable and cash flow generative broadband communications and video services providers in the United States. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin has increased from % for the three months ended March 31, 2016 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Optimum Acquisition to % for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Combined with our revenue growth, this translates into a % year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA growth. See "Summary Historical and 6 Table of Contents Pro Forma Financial Data" for additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income. As of December 31, 2016, we have realized a substantial portion of the total $1.1 billion in operating cost savings we announced that we would achieve over the three-year period following the Acquisitions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue was %, which we believe is one of the lowest among our U.S. industry peers, even as we increased our investments in network and service capabilities. The ratio of our Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures to revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was %, implying that for each dollar of Adjusted EBITDA that we realized in that quarter we generated approximately $ of Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, which we believe exceeds the performance of our U.S. industry peers. We believe our profitability, capital efficiency and cash generation profile, which is among the highest in the industry, results from a number of factors, including our focus on operational efficiency derived from the Altice Way, the advanced state of our HFC network infrastructure, our highly clustered network footprint and our customer base with relatively high ARPU and low churn. Experienced Management Team Supported by Founder Our CEO and Co-Presidents have substantial experience in communications and media operations, finance and mergers and acquisitions, and a proven track record in executing the Altice Way. Dexter Goei, our CEO and Chairman since 2016, joined Altice N.V. in 2009, and as its CEO he spearheaded the rapid expansion of the company from a French cable operator to a multinational communications enterprise with fixed and mobile assets across six different countries. A key aspect of Mr. Goei's role as CEO of Altice USA is to carry forward the same entrepreneurial and owner-operator culture that is at the core of the Altice Way and Altice N.V.'s success. Hakim Boubazine, our Co-President and COO since 2015, was previously the CEO of Altice Group's Dominican Republic business, where he oversaw pay television, broadband and mobile operations for more than four million customers. Charles Stewart, our Co-President and CFO since 2015, previously served as CEO of Itau BBA International plc, where he oversaw Itau-Unibanco's wholesale banking activities in Europe, United States and Asia. Prior to that, he spent nineteen years at Morgan Stanley in a variety of investment banking roles including nine years focused on the U.S. cable industry. Our management team operates in a coordinated fashion with Altice N.V.'s management team and is supported by Altice Group's founder and controlling stockholder, Patrick Drahi. We believe this facilitates a flat corporate structure, speed in decision making and a focus on long-term value creation. Our Business Strategy Our business strategy is based on the successful Altice Way. By executing on the principles described below, we aim to provide advanced, innovative broadband, pay television and telephony services to our customers and deliver strong returns to our stockholders. 7 Table of Contents The Altice Way Simplify and Optimize Our Organization Since the Acquisitions, we have implemented the Altice Way across our organization to streamline processes and service offerings and to improve productivity by centralizing our business functions, reorganizing our procurement processes, eliminating duplicative management functions and overhead, terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and third-party service arrangements, and investing in our employee relations and our culture. This has resulted in a revitalized organization as well as improved financial performance, which we are leveraging to re-invest in our business. We are also reorganizing and simplifying our customer service, programming and data analytics; using ATS to increase quality, efficiency and productivity; and updating and simplifying our IT infrastructure through further investments and integration. Reinvest in Infrastructure and Content Our entire Optimum footprint is upgraded to deliver broadband speeds of up to 300 Mbps for residential customers and up to 350 Mbps for business customers, and we have expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 60% of our Suddenlink footprint, compared to approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. In addition, we have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We believe we can carry out this network build-out efficiently and within our current capital expenditure levels because of (i) the proximity of fiber to our end customers in our existing network; (ii) our access to Altice Labs' experience and expertise in deploying GPON for its FTTH projects in other markets; (iii) our favorable network topology that is over 75% aerial; and (iv) the lower unit construction costs available to us through ATS. We believe our FTTH investment will further prepare us for the future by enabling us to provide our residential and business customers with technologically advanced services and increased network reliability, while providing us with lower operating costs and opportunities for new revenue sources. For instance, we believe our FTTH investment will offer significant strategic value as the mobile and fixed network environments continue to converge, particularly as mobile operators deploy 5G and subsequent mobile networks. Our reinvestment in content has focused on the news category with ongoing investments in our hyper-local news channel News12, our 25% investment in the U.S. operations of i24 News, the Altice Group global news network that was launched in the United States in February 2017, and our 25% interest in Newsday, a daily newspaper that primarily serves Long Island. In addition, we are evaluating opportunities to deploy other content assets owned by Altice Group. 8 Table of Contents Invest in Sales, Marketing and Innovation We are reinvesting in our sales channels, including enhancing our e-commerce channels such as Optimum.com and Suddenlink.com, and developing e-commerce-only promotions. We are also focused on building our brand to emphasize the quality of our services by developing Optimum Experience retail stores in shopping malls and other high-traffic locations. We seek to innovate across many areas of our business. For our residential customers, this includes our focus on new customer platforms and faster data speeds. For our business customers, we are introducing new value-added managed services while for our advertising clients we offer advanced, targeted and multi-screen advertising services and data analytics using our proprietary data and the advanced technology platforms that we have developed and acquired. Enhance the Customer Experience We intend to deliver a superior customer experience through implementation of the Altice Way. First, we aim to offer the most technologically advanced customer platforms, including our new home communications hub, which is an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface combining a set-top box, Internet router and cable modem in one device. Second, by leveraging our advanced infrastructure (with more than 8.5 million homes passed and approximately 1.8 million Wi-Fi hotspots as of December 31, 2016), we seek to provide our customers with a bandwidth and connectivity experience superior to what our competition offers. We believe our FTTH network build-out will further enhance our infrastructure position, improve service reliability for our customers and lower our maintenance costs. Third, we strive to provide the best service across the customer lifecycle from point of sale to installation and customer care. A key aspect of this initiative is to link internal sales incentives to metrics tied to the length of a new customer relationship and product mix, as opposed to more traditional criteria of new sales, in order to refocus our organization away from churn retention to churn prevention. For example, the number of technical service calls handled by our representatives in March 2017 was 23.8% lower compared to March 2016 while the number of customer service calls handled by our representatives was 17.3% lower over the same period. Drive Revenue and Cash Flow Growth Since the Acquisitions, we have made significant progress in improving our growth in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow and believe we have additional opportunities to drive continued growth in these financial metrics based on the following factors:  continued market demand for our bundled services, particularly broadband driven by increased data consumption and bandwidth requirements;  focus on selling and cross-selling higher value and more enriched service offerings to our residential and business customers, as well as the introduction of new services leveraging our advanced HFC and FTTH networks;  market share gains driven by product innovation and the quality and value of our services;  focus on connectivity, business and advertising services;  improvements in our operating and capital efficiency through continued implementation of the Altice Way; and  opportunities to further improve our capital structure. Opportunistically Grow Through Value-Accretive Acquisitions We intend to opportunistically grow through value-accretive acquisitions. Our controlling stockholder, Altice N.V., has made over 30 acquisitions since its inception in 2002, including the 9 Table of Contents Acquisitions. We believe Altice N.V. has consistently demonstrated an ability to acquire and effectively integrate companies, realize efficiencies and cost synergies, improve revenue trends and grow Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. In the six largest acquisitions completed by Altice N.V., SFR (formerly Numericable), Portugal Telecom, HOT, Orange Dominicana, Optimum and Suddenlink, it has increased Adjusted EBITDA margin on average by percentage points and revenue growth on average by percentage points between the first full fiscal quarter following the completion of each acquisition and the three months ended March 31, 2017. Altice N.V.'s track record of creating value through acquisitions is also reflected in the 32% average annual total return of SFR's ordinary shares since its initial public offering in November 2013 until March 31, 2017, compared to the 5% average annual total return of the STOXX Europe 600 Telecommunications Index, of which SFR's ordinary shares is a component, during the same time period. We believe the U.S. broadband communications and video services market offers a number of attractive opportunities to grow our business through strategic acquisitions. We believe the Altice Way and our related ability to achieve efficiencies and cost synergies following acquisitions provide us with a competitive advantage in such future consolidation opportunities. However, there is no assurance that we would be able to achieve similar results or that any such acquisitions would have a similar impact on our stock price performance. Risks Affecting Our Business Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. There are a number of risks you should carefully consider before investing in our Class A common stock. These risks are discussed more fully under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 17 of this prospectus, and include, but are not limited to:  If we are unable to successfully compete in our highly competitive business environment, where we face rapid changes in technology, consumer expectations and behavior, including significant unanticipated increases in the use of bandwidth-intensive Internet-based services, our ability to attract new subscribers, and retain current subscribers, may be adversely impacted.  Programming and retransmission costs are increasing and we may not have the ability to pass these increases on to our subscribers. Disputes with programmers and the inability to retain or obtain popular programming can adversely affect our relationship with subscribers and lead to subscriber losses.  If we do not successfully implement our growth strategy, including completing our capital investment plans on time and on budget, such as the build-out of our FTTH network, and the deployment of our new home communications hub, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.  We are highly leveraged and have substantial indebtedness, and our ability to incur additional indebtedness and use our funds is limited by significant restrictive covenants in financing agreements. We will need to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations. We may also engage in extraordinary transactions that involve the incurrence of large amounts of indebtedness.  The financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions, which have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our business, including by affecting the cost of new capital and our ability to fund acquisitions or other strategic transactions. We have in past periods incurred substantial losses from continuing operations, and we may do so in the future, which may reduce our ability to raise needed capital.  We rely on network and information systems for our operations and a disruption or failure of, or defects in, those systems may disrupt our operations, damage our reputation with customers and 10 Table of Contents adversely affect our results of operations. Our business depends on intellectual property rights and on not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.  Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect our business, increase our operational and administrative expenses and limit our revenues.  The tri-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with Altice N.V. and its affiliates and shares of Class B common stock will not automatically convert to shares of Class A common stock upon transfer to a third party. Holders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.  Altice N.V. and Patrick Drahi will continue to control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. Certain of our overlapping directors and officers have relationships with Altice N.V., which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities and other conflicts with respect to our business and executives.  We will be a "controlled company" within the meaning of the rules of the , and will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company's ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.

In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our cable distribution network. For Cequel, broadband services were not available to approximately 100 homes passed and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 homes passed. (b) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's services. (c) Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. (d) Represents the number of customers that subscribe to three of our services divided by total residential customer relationships. (e) Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by homes passed. (f) Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the fourth quarter of each year presented derived from the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers for the respective quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period. (g) The metrics for Cequel presented in the table above have been adjusted from previously reported amounts to conform to the methodology used to calculate the equivalent Cablevision metrics. 16 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus and the information set forth under the caption "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," before deciding whether to invest in shares of our Class A common stock. We describe below what we believe are currently the material risks and uncertainties we face, but they are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business We operate in a highly competitive business environment which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite-delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. Some of our competitors include AT&T and its DirecTV subsidiary, CenturyLink, DISH Network, Frontier and Verizon. In addition, our pay television services compete with all other sources of leisure, news, information and entertainment, including movies, sporting or other live events, radio broadcasts, home-video services, console games, print media and the Internet. In some instances, our competitors have fewer regulatory burdens, easier access to financing, greater resources, greater operating capabilities and efficiencies of scale, stronger brand-name recognition, longstanding relationships with regulatory authorities and customers, more subscribers, more flexibility to offer promotional packages at prices lower than ours and greater access to programming or other services. This competition creates pressure on our pricing and has adversely affected, and may continue to affect, our ability to add and retain customers, which in turn adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations. The effects of competition may also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our debt. For example, we face intense competition from Verizon, which has constructed FTTH network infrastructure that passes a significant number of households in our New York metropolitan service area. We estimate that Verizon is currently able to sell a fiber-based triple play, including broadband, pay television and telephony services, to at least half of the households in our New York metropolitan service area and may expand these and other service offerings to more customers in the future. Any estimate of Verizon's build-out and sales activity in our New York metropolitan service area is difficult to assess because it is based on visual inspections and other limited estimating techniques and therefore serves only as an approximation. Our competitive risks are heightened by the rapid technological change inherent in our business, evolving consumer preferences and the need to acquire, develop and adopt new technology to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, and to meet consumer demand. We may need to anticipate far in advance which technology we should use for the development of new products and services or the enhancement of existing products and services. The failure to accurately anticipate such changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Consolidation in our industry may allow our competitors to acquire service capabilities that are not available to us. In 17 Table of Contents addition, changes in the regulatory and legislative environments may result in changes to the competitive landscape. In addition, certain of our competitors own directly or are affiliated with companies that own programming content or have exclusive arrangements with content providers that may enable them to obtain lower programming costs or offer exclusive programming that may be attractive to prospective subscribers. For example, DirecTV has exclusive arrangements with the National Football League that give it access to programming we cannot offer. AT&T also has an agreement to acquire Time Warner, which owns a number of cable networks, including TBS, CNN and HBO, as well as Warner Bros. Entertainment, which produces television, film and home-video content. AT&T's and DirecTV's potential access to Time Warner programming could allow AT&T and DirecTV to offer competitive and promotional packages that could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenues. DBS operators such as DISH Network and DirecTV also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the DBS provider's pay television services are sold together with the phone company's broadband and mobile and traditional phone services. Another source of competition for our pay television services is the delivery of video content over the Internet directly to subscribers, some of which is offered without charging a fee for access to the content. This competition comes from a number of different sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections, such as Netflix, Hulu, iTunes, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Sling TV, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now and Go90. It is possible that additional competitors will enter the market and begin providing video content over the Internet directly to subscribers. Increasingly, content owners, such as HBO and CBS, are selling their programming directly to consumers over the Internet without requiring a pay-television subscription. The availability of these services has and will continue to adversely affect customer demand for our pay television services, including premium and on-demand services. Further, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. Internet access services are also offered by providers of wireless services, including traditional cellular phone carriers and others focused solely on wireless data services. All wireless carriers have started to offer unlimited data plans, which could, in some cases, become a substitute for the fixed broadband services we provide. The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") is likely to continue to make additional radio spectrum available for these wireless Internet access services. Our pay television services also face competition from broadcast television stations, entities that make digital video recorded movies and programs available for home rental or sale, SMATV systems, which generally serve large MDUs under an agreement with the landlord and service providers and open video system operators. Private cable systems can offer improved reception of local television stations and many of the same satellite-delivered program services that are offered by cable systems. SMATV systems currently benefit from operating advantages not available to franchised cable systems, including fewer regulatory burdens. Cable television has also long competed with broadcast television, which consists of television signals that the viewer is able to receive without charge using an "off-air" antenna. The extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signals available through "off-air" reception, compared to the services provided by the local cable system. The use of radio spectrum now provides traditional broadcasters with the ability to deliver HD television pictures and multiple digital-quality program streams. There can be no assurance that existing, proposed or as yet undeveloped technologies will not become dominant in the future and render our video service offering less profitable or even obsolete. Most broadband communications companies, which already have wired networks, an existing customer base and other operational functions in place (such as billing and service personnel), offer DSL services. We believe DSL service competes with our broadband service and is often offered at prices lower than our Internet services. However, DSL is often offered at speeds lower than the speeds 18 Table of Contents we offer. In addition, DSL providers may currently be in a better position to offer Internet services to businesses since their networks tend to be more complete in commercial areas. They may also increasingly have the ability to combine video services with telephone and Internet services offered to their customers, particularly as broadband communications companies enter into co-marketing agreements with other service providers. In addition, current and future fixed and wireless Internet services, such as 3G, 4G and 5G fixed and wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets and smartphones, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our broadband services. Our telephony services compete directly with established broadband communications companies and other carriers, including wireless providers, as increasing numbers of homes are replacing their traditional telephone service with wireless telephone service. We also compete against VoIP providers like Vonage, Skype, GoogleTalk, Facetime, WhatsApp and magicJack that do not own networks but can provide service to any person with a broadband connection, in some cases free of charge. In addition, we compete against ILECs, other CLECs and long-distance voice-service companies for large commercial and enterprise customers. While we compete with the ILECs, we also enter into interconnection agreements with ILECs so that our customers can make and receive calls to and from customers served by the ILECs and other telecommunications providers. Federal and state law and regulations require ILECs to enter into such agreements and provide facilities and services necessary for connection, at prices subject to regulation. The specific price, terms and conditions of each agreement, however, depend on the outcome of negotiations between us and each ILEC. Interconnection agreements are also subject to approval by the state regulatory commissions, which may arbitrate negotiation impasses. We have entered into interconnection agreements with Verizon for New York, New Jersey and portions of Connecticut, and with Frontier for portions of Connecticut, which have been approved by the respective state commissions. We have also entered into interconnection agreements with other ILECs in New York and New Jersey. These agreements, like all interconnection agreements, are for limited terms and upon expiration are subject to renegotiation, potential arbitration and approval under the laws in effect at that time. We also face competition for our advertising sales from traditional and non-traditional media outlets, including television and radio stations, traditional print media and the Internet. We face significant risks as a result of rapid changes in technology, consumer expectations and behavior. The broadband communications industry has undergone significant technological development over time and these changes continue to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such changes have had, and will continue to have, a profound impact on consumer expectations and behavior. Our video business faces technological change risks as a result of the continuing development of new and changing methods for delivery of programming content such as Internet-based delivery of movies, shows and other content which can be viewed on televisions, wireless devices and other developing mobile devices. Consumers' video consumption patterns are also evolving, for example, with more content being downloaded for time-shifted consumption. A proliferation of delivery systems for video content can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers and the demand for our services and it can also decrease advertising demand on our delivery systems. Our broadband business faces technological challenges from rapidly evolving wireless Internet solutions. Our telephony service offerings face technological developments in the proliferation of telephony delivery systems including those based on Internet and wireless delivery. If we do not develop or acquire and successfully implement new technologies, we will limit our ability to compete effectively for subscribers, content and advertising. We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits we expect from the introduction of our new home communications hub or that it will be introduced to the market in the timeframe we anticipate and with all anticipated features and functionality. In addition, we may be required to make material capital and other investments to 19 Table of Contents anticipate and to keep up with technological change. These challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our U.S. industry peers might introduce a "quad-play" offering that bundles broadband, pay television, telephony and mobile communications services. This might lead our customers to expect similar bundled offerings from us, which in turn could result in increased customer churn if we do not, or are unable to, offer similar quad-play bundles, or could require additional investments by us to meet market demand. There can be no assurance that we can offer quad-play bundles successfully or on terms favorable to us. Programming and retransmission costs are increasing and we may not have the ability to pass these increases on to our subscribers. Disputes with programmers and the inability to retain or obtain popular programming can adversely affect our relationship with subscribers and lead to subscriber losses. Programming costs are one of our largest categories of expenses. In recent years, the cost of programming in the cable and satellite video industries has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. We may not be able to pass programming cost increases on to our subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment. If we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Moreover, programming costs are related directly to the number of subscribers to whom the programming is provided. Our smaller subscriber base relative to our competitors may limit our ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs, which could result in reduced operating margins relative to our competitors with a larger subscriber base. The expiration dates of our various programming contracts are staggered, which results in the expiration of a portion of our programming contracts throughout each year. A contract with one of our ten largest programmers has expired and we are currently in the process of renegotiating a renewal of this contract. We attempt to control our programming costs and, therefore, the cost of our video services to our customers, by negotiating favorable terms for the renewal of our affiliation agreements with programmers. On certain occasions in the past, such negotiations have led to disputes with programmers that have resulted in temporary periods during which we did not carry or decided to stop carrying a particular broadcast network or programming service or services. Additionally, in our Suddenlink segment, we were unable to reach agreement with Viacom on acceptable economic terms for a long-term contract renewal and, effective October 1, 2014, all Viacom networks were removed from our channel lineups in our Suddenlink footprint. To the extent we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms we believe are reasonable, we may be forced to, or determine for strategic or business reasons to, remove certain programming channels from our line-up and may decide to replace such programming channels with other programming channels, which may not be available on acceptable terms or be as attractive to customers. Such disputes, or the removal or replacement of programming, may inconvenience some of our subscribers and can lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. There can be no assurance that our existing programming contracts will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms, or at all, or that the rights we negotiate will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy. We may also be subject to increasing financial and other demands by broadcast stations. Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between "must-carry" rights and an alternative "retransmission consent" regime. Local stations that elect "must-carry" are entitled to mandatory carriage on our systems, but at no fee. When a station opts for retransmission consent, cable operators negotiate for the right to carry the station's signal, which typically requires payment of a per-subscriber fee. Our retransmission agreements with stations expire from time to time. Upon expiration of these agreements, we may carry some stations under short-term arrangements while we 20 Table of Contents attempt to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. In connection with any negotiation of new retransmission agreements, we may become subject to increased or additional costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. To the extent that we cannot pass on such increased or additional costs to customers or offset such increased or additional costs through the sale of additional services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in the event contract negotiations with stations are unsuccessful, we could be required, or determine for strategic or business reasons, to cease carrying such stations' signals, possibly for an indefinite period. Any loss of stations could make our video service less attractive to our customers, which could result in a loss of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. There can be no assurance that any expiring retransmission agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms, or at all. We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy. Our future growth, profitability and results of operations depend upon our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, which, in turn, is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to continue to:  simplify and optimize our organization;  reinvest in infrastructure and content;  invest in sales, marketing and innovation;  enhance the customer experience;  drive revenue and cash flow growth; and  opportunistically grow through value-accretive acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we can successfully achieve any or all of the above initiatives in the manner or time period that we expect. Furthermore, achieving these objectives will require investments which may result in short-term costs without generating any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings. We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits we expect our strategy will achieve. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to continue improving our operational performance and customer experience we may face a decrease in new subscribers and an increase in subscriber churn, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our plan to build a FTTH network within the anticipated five-year timeline or at all or within the cost parameters we currently expect. Similarly, we may not be successful in deploying our new home communications hub on our current timeline or at all and we may face technological or other challenges in pursuing these or other initiatives. The financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions, which have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our business, including by affecting the cost of new capital and our ability to fund acquisitions or other strategic transactions. The capital markets experience volatility and disruption. At times, the markets have exerted extreme downward pressure on stock prices and upward pressure on the cost of new debt, which has severely restricted credit availability for many companies. Historical market disruptions have typically been accompanied by a broader economic downturn, which has historically led to lower demand for our products, such as video services, as well as lower 21 Table of Contents levels of television advertising, and increased incidence of customers' inability to pay for the services we provide. A recurrence of these conditions may further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on the capital markets, particularly for offerings of debt securities and borrowings under syndicated facilities, to meet our financial commitments and liquidity needs and to fund acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Disruptions or volatility in the capital markets could also adversely affect our ability to refinance on satisfactory terms, or at all, our scheduled debt maturities and could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital markets as well as the broader global financial market can also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities. Such disruptions could increase our interest expense, adversely affecting our business, financial position and results of operations. Our access to funds under our revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to those facilities to meet their funding commitments. Those financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. Moreover, the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. Longer term, volatility and disruptions in the capital markets and the broader global financial market as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses. Such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash or impede or delay potential acquisitions, strategic transactions and refinancing transactions until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. We are highly leveraged and have substantial indebtedness, which reduces our capability to withstand adverse developments or business conditions. We have incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to finance the Acquisitions, our operations, upgrades to our cable plant and acquisitions of other cable systems, sources of programming and other businesses. We have also incurred substantial indebtedness in order to offer new or upgraded services to our current and potential customers. At December 31, 2016, our total aggregate indebtedness was approximately $22.3 billion (excluding notes payable to affiliates and related parties). Because we are highly leveraged, our payments on our indebtedness are significant in relation to our revenues and cash flow, which exposes us to significant risk in the event of downturns in our businesses (whether through competitive pressures or otherwise), our industry or the economy generally, since our cash flows would decrease, but our required payments under our indebtedness would not. Economic downturns may impact our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our indentures, credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness and may impact our ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness as it comes due. If we do not repay or refinance our debt obligations when they become due and do not otherwise comply with the covenants and restrictions in our indentures, credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we would be in default under those agreements and the underlying debt could be declared immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under any of our indentures, credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under any other debt instruments or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness incurred under our indentures, credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness were 22 Table of Contents accelerated, we would not have sufficient cash to repay amounts due thereunder. To avoid a default, we could be required to defer capital expenditures, sell assets, seek strategic investments from third parties or otherwise reduce or eliminate discretionary uses of cash. However, if such measures were to become necessary, there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell sufficient assets or raise strategic investment capital sufficient to meet our scheduled debt maturities as they come due. In addition, any significant reduction in necessary capital expenditures could adversely affect our ability to retain our existing customer base and obtain new customers, which would adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could also:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy obligations under our outstanding indebtedness;  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;  limit our ability to adapt to changing market conditions;  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;  require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to paying the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other corporate purposes;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the broadband communications industry generally; and  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have a less significant debt burden. In addition, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, our variable-rate debt will have higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition. For more information, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk." Although we have historically entered into, and may in the future enter into, hedging arrangements to limit our exposure to an increase in interest rates, such arrangements may not offer complete protection from this risk. If we incur additional indebtedness, such indebtedness could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, such indebtedness will be added to our current debt levels and the related risks we currently face could be magnified. Any decrease in our revenues or an increase in operating costs (and corresponding reduction in our cash flows) would also adversely affect our ability to pay our indebtedness as it comes due. We have in past periods incurred substantial losses from continuing operations, and we may do so in the future, which may reduce our ability to raise needed capital. We have in the past reported substantial losses from continuing operations and we may do so in the future. Significant losses from continuing operations could limit our ability to raise any needed financing, or to do so on favorable terms, as such losses could be taken into account by potential investors, lenders and the organizations that issue investment ratings on our indebtedness. 23 Table of Contents A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our subsidiaries' debt securities and credit facilities by ratings agencies may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. In addition, developments in our business and operations or the amount of indebtedness could lead to a ratings downgrade on our or our subsidiaries' indebtedness. The debt ratings for our subsidiaries' debt securities and credit facilities are currently below the "investment grade" category, which results in higher borrowing costs as well as a reduced pool of potential investors of that debt as some investors will not purchase debt securities or become lenders under credit facilities that are not rated in an investment grade rating category. In addition, there can be no assurance that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Any such fluctuation in the rating of us or our subsidiaries may impact our ability to access debt markets in the future or increase our cost of future debt which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in return may adversely affect the trading price of shares of our Class A common stock. Our subsidiaries' ability to meet obligations under their indebtedness may be restricted by limitations on our other subsidiaries' ability to send funds. Our subsidiaries that have incurred indebtedness under indentures and credit facilities are primarily holding companies whose ability to pay interest and principal on such indebtedness is wholly or partially dependent upon the operations of their respective subsidiaries and the distributions or other payments of cash, in the form of distributions, loans or advances, those other subsidiaries deliver to our indebted subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless any such subsidiaries has guaranteed the underlying indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our indebted subsidiaries' indebtedness or to make any funds available to our indebted subsidiaries to do so. These subsidiaries may not generate enough cash to make such funds available to our indebted subsidiaries and in certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may also limit their ability to do so. Also, our subsidiaries' creditors, including trade creditors, in the event of a liquidation or reorganization of any subsidiary, would be entitled to a claim on the assets of such subsidiaries, including any assets transferred to those subsidiaries, prior to any of our claims as a stockholder and those creditors are likely to be paid in full before any distribution is made to us. To the extent that we are a creditor of a subsidiary, our claims could be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and/or any indebtedness of that subsidiary senior to that held by us. In addition, our Optimum and Suddenlink businesses are each currently financed on a standalone basis and constitute separate financing groups, which are subject to covenants that restrict the use of their respective cash flows outside their respective restricted groups. Consequently, cash flows from operations of Optimum and its subsidiaries may not be able to be applied to meet the obligations or other expenses of Suddenlink and its subsidiaries and cash flows from operations of Suddenlink may not be able to be applied to meet the obligations or other expenses of Optimum and its subsidiaries, except to the extent that the relevant restricted group is able to pay a dividend under the agreements governing their respective indebtedness. 24 Table of Contents Our ability to incur additional indebtedness and use our funds is limited by significant restrictive covenants in financing agreements. The indentures, credit facilities and agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries contain various negative covenants that restrict our subsidiaries' (and their respective subsidiaries') ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;  pay dividends or make other distributions, or repurchase or redeem capital stock;  prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt or equity;  issue certain preferred stock;  make loans and investments;  sell assets;  incur liens;  enter into transactions with affiliates;  create or permit any encumbrances or restrictions on the ability of their respective subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions, make loans or advances or transfer assets, in each case to such subsidiary, or its other restricted subsidiaries; and  consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets. We are also subject to certain affirmative covenants under our subsidiaries' revolving credit facilities, which, among other things, require the relevant Optimum and Suddenlink subsidiaries to each maintain a specified financial ratio if there are any outstanding utilizations. Our ability to meet these financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these ratios. Violation of these covenants could result in a default that would permit the relevant creditors to require the immediate repayment of the borrowings thereunder, which could result in a default under other debt instruments and agreements that contain cross-default provisions and, in the case of revolving credit facilities, permit the relevant lenders to restrict the relevant borrower's ability to borrow undrawn funds under such revolving credit facilities. A default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may be:  limited in how we conduct our business;  unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or  unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy and on the value of our debt and equity securities. In addition, our financial results, substantial indebtedness and credit ratings could materially adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing. 25 Table of Contents We will need to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business. We may also engage in extraordinary transactions that involve the incurrence of large amounts of indebtedness. Our business is capital intensive. Operating and maintaining our cable systems requires significant amounts of cash payments to third parties. Capital expenditures were $625.5 million in 2016 and on a pro forma basis were $956.0 million and $1,294.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and primarily included payments for customer premise equipment, such as new digital video cable boxes and modems, as well as infrastructure and capital expenditures related to our networks, in addition to the capital requirements of our other businesses. We have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We also plan to introduce a new home communications hub during the second quarter of 2017, which will be the most advanced home communications hub offered by any Altice Group business. We may not be able to execute these initiatives within the anticipated timelines and we may incur greater than anticipated costs and capital expenditures in connection therewith, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience business disruptions or encounter other challenges to executing either as planned. The failure to realize the anticipated benefits of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect these capital expenditures to continue to be significant as we further enhance our service offerings. We may have substantial future capital commitments in the form of long-term contracts that require substantial payments over a period of time. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash internally to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet these obligations and repay our indebtedness at maturity. Accordingly, we may have to do one or more of the following:  refinance existing obligations to extend maturities;  raise additional capital, through debt or equity issuances or both;  cancel or scale back current and future spending programs; or  sell assets or interests in one or more of our businesses. However, we may not be able to refinance existing obligations or raise any required additional capital or to do so on favorable terms. Borrowing costs related to future capital raising activities may be significantly higher than our current borrowing costs and we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all, if financial markets experience volatility. If we are unable to pursue our current and future spending programs, we may be forced to cancel or scale back those programs. Our choice of which spending programs to cancel or reduce may be limited. Failure to successfully pursue our capital expenditure and other spending plans could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. It is possible that in the future we may also engage in extraordinary transactions and such transactions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness. We rely on network and information systems for our operations and a disruption or failure of, or defects in, those systems may disrupt our operations, damage our reputation with customers and adversely affect our results of operations. Network and information systems are essential to our ability to deliver our services to our customers. While we have in place multiple security systems designed to protect against intentional or unintentional disruption, failure, misappropriation or corruption of our network and information systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our network and information systems will prevent any of the problems identified above. A problem of this type might be caused by events such as 26 Table of Contents computer hacking, computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, "cyber-attacks" and other malicious activity, defects in the hardware and software comprising our network and information systems, as well as natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks and similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our plant, equipment and data. Operational or business delays may result from the disruption of network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities. Moreover, these events may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers and our results of operations could suffer. We also use certain vendors to supply some of the hardware, software and support of our network, some of which have been customized or altered to fit our business needs. Certain of these vendors and suppliers may have leverage over us considering that there are limited suppliers of certain products and services, or that there is a long lead time and/or significant expense required to transition to another provider. In addition, some of these vendors and suppliers do not have a long operating history or may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire. Some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors and some of our service providers represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. In addition, because of the pace at which technological innovations occur in our industry, we may not be able to obtain access to the latest technology on reasonable terms. Any delays or the termination or disruption in these relationships as a result of contractual disagreements, operational or financial failures on the part of our vendors and suppliers, or other adverse events that prevent such vendors and suppliers from providing the equipment or services we need, with the level of quality we require, in a timely manner and at reasonable prices, could result in significant costs to us and have a negative effect on our ability to provide services and rollout advanced services. Our ability to replace such vendors and suppliers may be limited and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. If we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, our results of operations and reputation could suffer. The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our customers and employees. We have procedures in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities and to our proprietary business information. If our efforts to protect the security of information about our customers and employees are unsuccessful, a significant data security breach may result in costly government enforcement actions, private litigation and negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers, and our financial condition and results of operations could suffer. A portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining agreements can increase our expenses. Labor disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, 227 of our full-time employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements (primarily technicians in Brooklyn, New York) with the Communication Workers of America ("CWA"). Optimum and the CWA entered into a collective bargaining agreement in 2015. This agreement was renewed in June 2016 for an additional three-year term. On March 10, 2017, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ("IBEW") was certified to represent 100 employees in Oakland, New Jersey. We have not yet negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the IBEW relating to these employees and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on terms 27 Table of Contents acceptable to us. The collective bargaining agreements with the CWA and IBEW covering these groups of employees or any other agreements with other unions may increase our expenses. In addition, any disruptions to our operations due to labor related problems could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant amount of our book value consists of intangible assets that may not generate cash in the event of a voluntary or involuntary sale. At December 31, 2016, we reported approximately $36.5 billion of consolidated total assets, of which approximately $27.4 billion were intangible. Intangible assets primarily included franchises from city and county governments to operate cable systems, goodwill, customer relationships and trade names. While we believe the carrying values of our intangible assets are recoverable, we may not receive any cash in the event of a voluntary or involuntary sale of these intangible assets, particularly if we were not continuing as an operating business. We urge you to read carefully our consolidated financial statements contained herein, which provide more detailed information about these intangible assets. We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions and the integration of such acquisitions and other strategic transactions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business has grown significantly as a result of acquisitions, including the Acquisitions, which entail numerous risks including:  distraction of our management team in identifying potential acquisition targets, conducting due diligence and negotiating acquisition agreements;  difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel, products, technologies and systems of acquired businesses;  difficulties in enhancing our customer support resources to adequately service our existing customers and the customers of acquired businesses;  the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses;  unanticipated liabilities or contingencies of acquired businesses;  unbudgeted costs which we may incur in connection with pursuing potential acquisitions which are not consummated;  failure to achieve projected cost savings or cash flow from acquired businesses, which are based on projections that are inherently uncertain;  fluctuations in our operating results caused by incurring considerable expenses to acquire and integrate businesses before receiving the anticipated revenues expected to result from the acquisitions; and  difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals required to consummate acquisitions. We also participate in competitive bidding processes, some of which may involve significant cable systems. If we are the winning bidder in any such process involving significant cable systems or we otherwise engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future, we may incur additional debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also issue substantial additional equity which could dilute existing stockholders. If our acquisitions, including the Acquisitions and the integration of the Optimum and Suddenlink businesses, do not result in the anticipated operating efficiencies, are not effectively integrated, or 28 Table of Contents result in costs which exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Certain of our overlapping directors and officers have relationships with Altice N.V., which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities and other conflicts with respect to our business and executives. Following this offering, four of our directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, will be employed by or affiliated with Altice N.V. These directors have fiduciary duties to us and, in addition, have duties to Altice N.V. As a result, these directors and officers may face real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and Altice N.V., whose interests may be adverse to ours in some circumstances. Prior to the completion of this offering, our board of directors will adopt a policy that acknowledges that directors and officers of the Company may also be serving as directors, officers, employees or agents of Altice N.V. and its subsidiaries other than us and that we may engage in material business transactions with such entities. The Company renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and the new policy provides that no director or officer of the Company who is also serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of Altice N.V. and its other subsidiaries will be liable to the Company for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in the policy) to Altice N.V. and its other subsidiaries instead of the Company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to the Company. The policy expressly validates certain contracts, agreements, assignments and transactions (and amendments, modifications or terminations thereof) between the Company and Altice N.V. and/or any of its other subsidiaries and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the actions of the overlapping directors or officers in connection therewith are not breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Significant unanticipated increases in the use of bandwidth-intensive Internet-based services could increase our costs. The rising popularity of bandwidth-intensive Internet-based services poses risks for our broadband services. Examples of such services include peer-to-peer file sharing services, gaming services and the delivery of video via streaming technology and by download. If heavy usage of bandwidth-intensive broadband services grows beyond our current expectations, we may need to incur more expenses than currently anticipated to expand the bandwidth capacity of our systems or our customers could have a suboptimal experience when using our broadband service. In order to continue to provide quality service at attractive prices, we need the continued flexibility to develop and refine business models that respond to changing consumer uses and demands and to manage bandwidth usage efficiently. Our ability to undertake such actions could be restricted by regulatory and legislative efforts to impose so-called "net neutrality" requirements on broadband communication providers like us that provide broadband services. For more information, see "RegulationBroadband." Our business depends on intellectual property rights and on not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use our technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged and invalidated by third parties and may not be strong enough to provide meaningful commercial competitive advantage. Third parties have in the past, and may in the future, assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth 29 Table of Contents and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, we believe it is not possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. Asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products and/or services or components of those products and/or services. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to modify our business, develop a non-infringing technology, be enjoined from use of certain intellectual property, use alternate technology or enter into license agreements. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to modify our business, develop non-infringing technology, use alternate technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our networks. The law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, stored or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled. As such, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to content disseminated on our networks. Claims could challenge the accuracy of materials on our network or could involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or are required to defend ourselves against such claims, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected. Our operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. The competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry could adversely impact our ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results. Impairment of Altice Group's reputation could adversely affect current and future customers' perception of Altice USA. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of Altice Group's reputation, the quality of its products and its corporate and management integrity. The broadband communications and video services industry is by its nature more prone to reputational risks than other industries. This has been compounded in recent years by the free flow of unverified information on the Internet and, in particular, on social media. Impairment, including any loss of goodwill or reputational advantages, of Altice Group's reputation in markets in which we do not operate could adversely affect current and future customers' perception of Altice USA. 30 Table of Contents Macroeconomic developments may adversely affect our business. Our performance is subject to global economic conditions and the related impact on consumer spending levels. Continued uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news, and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products and services. As our business depends on consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, and lower home values. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Online piracy of entertainment and media content could result in reduced revenues and increased expenditures which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Online entertainment and media content piracy is extensive in many parts of the world and is made easier by technological advances. This trend facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of entertainment and media content. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of this content will likely continue, and if it does, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations because these products could reduce the revenue we receive for our products. Additionally, in order to contain this problem, we may have to implement elaborate and costly security and antipiracy measures, which could result in significant expenses and losses of revenue. There can be no assurance that even the highest levels of security and anti-piracy measures will prevent piracy. The MSG Distribution and the AMC Networks Distribution could result in significant tax liability. We have received private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") to the effect that, among other things, the MSG Distribution (whereby Optimum distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of The Madison Square Garden Company ("Madison Square Garden"), a company which owns the sports, entertainment and media businesses previously owned and operated by Optimum) and the AMC Networks Distribution (whereby Optimum distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of AMC Networks, a company which consisted principally of national programming networks, including AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel, previously owned and operated by Optimum) and certain related transactions, will qualify for tax-free treatment under the Code. Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the ruling. Furthermore, the IRS will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code. Rather, the ruling is based upon our representations that these conditions have been satisfied, and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling. If the MSG Distribution or the AMC Networks Distribution does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the Madison Square Garden common stock or AMC Networks common stock, as the case may be, in a taxable sale for its fair value. Optimum stockholders at the time of the distributions would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair value of Madison Square Garden common stock or AMC Networks common stock, as the case may be, that was distributed to them, which generally would be treated as a taxable dividend. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to Optimum's stockholders and us would be substantial. 31 Table of Contents Risk Factors Relating to Regulatory and Legislative Matters Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect our business, increase our operational and administrative expenses and limit our revenues. Regulation of our industry has increased broadband communications companies' operational and administrative expenses and limited their revenues. Broadband communications companies are subject to, among other things:  rules governing the provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technologies;  rules and regulations relating to data protection and customer and employee privacy;  rules establishing limited rate regulation of video service;  rules governing the copyright royalties that must be paid for retransmitting broadcast signals;  rules governing when a cable system must carry a particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;  rules governing the provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmers;  rules limiting the ability to enter into exclusive agreements with MDUs and control inside wiring;  rules, regulations and regulatory policies relating to the provision of broadband service, including new "net neutrality" requirements;  rules, regulations and regulatory policies relating to the provision of telephony services;  rules for franchise renewals and transfers; and  other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards and customer service and consumer protection requirements. Many aspects of these regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. There are also ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state and local regulation of some of our cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks we already face, and proposals that might make it easier for our employees to unionize. The federal Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibited many taxes on Internet access service, but was subject to periodic renewals, was recently modified so that the collection of taxes on Internet service is now permanently prohibited. Certain states and localities are considering new cable and telecommunications taxes that could increase operating expenses. Certain states are also considering adopting energy efficiency regulations governing the operation of equipment that we use, which could constrain innovation. Congress has recently considered whether to rewrite the entire Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act") to account for changes in the communications marketplace or to adopt more focused changes. In response to recent data breaches and increasing concerns regarding the protection of consumers' personal information, Congress and regulatory agencies are considering the adoption of new privacy and data security laws and regulations that could result in additional privacy, as well as network and information security, requirements for our business. These new laws, as well as existing legal and regulatory obligations, could require significant expenditures. 32 Table of Contents Additionally, there have been statements by federal government officials indicating that some laws and regulations applicable to our industry may be repealed or modified in a way that could be favorable to us and our competitors. There can be no assurance that any such repeal or modification will be beneficial to us or will not be more beneficial to our current and future competitors. Our cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business. Our cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. Some franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. As of December 31, 2016, one of our largest franchises, the Town of Hempstead, New York, comprising an aggregate of approximately 85,000 pay television customers, was expired. We are currently lawfully operating in the Town of Hempstead, New York franchise area under temporary authority recognized by the State of New York. Lightpath holds a franchise from New York City that expired on December 20, 2008 and the renewal process is ongoing. We believe New York City is treating the expiration date of this franchise as extended until a formal determination on renewal is made, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in renewing this franchise on anticipated terms or at all. We expect to renew or continue to operate under all or substantially all of our franchises. The traditional cable franchising regime is currently undergoing significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. Some state franchising laws do not allow incumbent operators like us to immediately opt into favorable statewide franchising as quickly as new entrants, and often require us to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than those applied to new entrants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisors have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew on terms as favorable, our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area. Our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Accordingly, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises and create competition in market areas where none existed previously, resulting in overbuilds, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Cable systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises historically granted by local authorities. More than one cable system may legally be built in the same area, which is referred to as an overbuild. It is possible that a franchising authority might grant a second franchise to another cable operator and that such franchise might contain terms and conditions more favorable than those afforded to us. Although entry into the cable industry involves significant cost barriers and risks, well-financed businesses from outside the cable industry, such as public utilities that already possess fiber optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve, may over time become competitors. In addition, there 33 Table of Contents are a few cities that have constructed their own cable systems, in a manner similar to city-provided utility services, and private cable companies not affiliated with established local exchange carriers have also demonstrated an interest in constructing overbuilds. We believe that for any potential competitor to be successful, such competitor's overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses in the overbuilt area with equal or better service quality, on a more cost-effective basis than we can. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us without securing a local franchise or on more favorable franchise terms. There are federal legislative and regulatory proposals now pending regarding the ability of municipalities to construct and deploy broadband facilities that could compete with our cable systems. In addition, certain telephone companies are seeking authority to operate in communities without first obtaining a local franchise. As a result, competing operators may build systems in areas in which we hold franchises. The FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (including those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. At the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws. Again, these laws were principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and they often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing operators. As a result of these new franchising laws and regulations, we have seen an increase in the number of competitive cable franchises or operating certificates being issued, and we anticipate that trend to continue. We believe the markets we serve are not significantly overbuilt. However, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions direct certain subsidies to entities deploying broadband to areas deemed to be "unserved" or "underserved." Many other organizations have applied for and received these funds, including broadband services competitors and new entrants into such services. We have generally opposed such subsidies when directed to areas that we serve and have deployed broadband capable networks. Despite those efforts, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage if recipients use these funds to subsidize services that compete with our broadband services. Local franchising authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraints on our business, which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. In addition to the franchise agreement, local franchising authorities in some jurisdictions have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation of cable systems. This additional regulation increases the cost of operating our business. For example, some local franchising authorities impose minimum customer service standards on our operations. There are no assurances that the local franchising authorities will not impose new and more restrictive requirements. Local franchising authorities who are certified to regulate rates generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic service and equipment, which could reduce our revenues. Further regulation of the cable industry could restrict our marketing options or impair our ability to raise rates to cover our increasing costs. The cable industry has operated under a federal rate regulation regime for approximately two decades. Currently, rate regulation is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activities. Our franchise authorities have not certified to exercise this limited rate regulation authority, and they would now need to demonstrate the absence of "effective competition" (as defined under federal law) as part of any rate regulation certification. However, the FCC and Congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation. It is possible that either the FCC or Congress will adopt more extensive rate regulation for our pay television services or regulate our other services, such as broadband and telephony services, which could impede our ability to raise rates, or require rate reductions. To the extent we are unable to raise our rates in response to increasing costs, or are required to reduce our rates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity will be materially adversely affected. There has been legislative and regulatory 34 Table of Contents interest in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an à la carte basis. It is possible that new marketing restrictions could be adopted in the future. These restrictions could affect how we provide, and limit, customer equipment used in connection with our services and how we provide access to video programming beyond conventional cable delivery. A recent FCC proposal that would require MVPDs to accommodate third-party devices through the provision of multiple "information flows" to third-party devices could, if adopted, adversely affect our relationship with our customers and programmers and our operations. It is also possible that regulations will be adopted affecting the negotiations between MVPDs (like us) and programmers. While these regulations might provide us with additional rights and protections in our programming negotiations, they might also limit our flexibility in ways that adversely affect our operations. We may be materially adversely affected by regulatory changes related to pole attachment costs. Pole attachments are cable wires that are attached to utility poles. Cable system pole attachments to utility poles historically have been regulated at the federal or state level, generally resulting in favorable pole attachment rates for attachments used to provide cable service. Any changes in the current pole attachment approach could result in a substantial increase in our pole attachment costs. Changes in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on us. Cable operators also face significant regulation affecting the carriage of broadcast and other programming channels. We can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that we might not otherwise carry voluntarily, including certain local broadcast signals; local public, educational and governmental access programming; and unaffiliated, commercial leased access programming (channel capacity designated for use by programmers unaffiliated with the cable operator). Regulatory changes in this area could disrupt existing programming commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our ability to offer services that would maximize our revenue potential. It is possible that other legal restraints will be adopted limiting our discretion over programming decisions. Increasing regulation of our Internet-based products and services could adversely affect our ability to provide new products and services. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted a new "network neutrality" or Open Internet order (the "2015 Order") that: (1) reclassified broadband Internet access service as a Title II common carrier service, (2) applied certain existing Title II provisions and associated regulations; (3) forbore from applying a range of other existing Title II provisions and associated regulations, but to varying degrees indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary and (4) issued new rules expanding disclosure requirements and prohibiting blocking, throttling, paid prioritization and unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. The 2015 Order also subjected broadband providers' Internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential FCC oversight and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters. The 2015 Order has been appealed by multiple parties, but the rules are currently in effect. The 2015 Order could limit our ability to efficiently manage our cable systems and respond to operational and competitive challenges. Offering telephone services may subject us to additional regulatory burdens, causing us to incur additional costs. We offer telephone services over our broadband network and continue to develop and deploy interconnected VoIP services. The FCC has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those that we offer to our customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that our VoIP services can operate in the market. However, the scope of these interconnection rights are being reviewed in a current 35 Table of Contents FCC proceeding, which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of telephony services or result in additional costs. It remains unclear precisely to what extent federal and state regulators will subject VoIP services to traditional telephone service regulation. Expanding our offering of these services may require us to obtain certain authorizations, including federal and state licenses. We may not be able to obtain such authorizations in a timely manner, or conditions could be imposed upon such licenses or authorizations that may not be favorable to us. The FCC has already extended certain traditional telecommunications requirements, such as E911 capabilities, Universal Service Fund contribution, Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA"), measures to protect Customer Proprietary Network Information, customer privacy, disability access, number porting, battery back-up, network outage reporting, rural call completion reporting and other regulatory requirements to many VoIP providers such as us. If additional telecommunications regulations are applied to our VoIP service, it could cause us to incur additional costs and may otherwise materially adversely impact our operations. In 2011, the FCC released an order significantly changing the rules governing intercarrier compensation for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between interconnected carriers. These rules have resulted in a substantial decrease in interstate compensation payments over a multi-year period. Further, the FCC's initiative to collect data concerning certain point to point transport ("special access") services we provide could result in additional regulatory burdens and additional costs. We may be materially adversely affected by regulatory, legal and economic changes relating to our physical plant. Our systems depend on physical facilities, including transmission equipment and miles of fiber and coaxial cable. Significant portions of those physical facilities occupy public rights-of-way and are subject to local ordinances and governmental regulations. Other portions occupy private property under express or implied easements, and many miles of the cable are attached to utility poles governed by pole attachment agreements. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain and use our facilities in their current locations and at their current costs. Changes in governmental regulations or changes in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. Changes in tax legislation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current administration and the Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives have publicly stated that one of their top legislative priorities is significant reform of the U.S. federal income tax legislation, including significant changes to the taxation of business entities. Changes in U.S. federal income tax legislation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The timing and details of any tax reform, as well as the impact it may have on us, remain unclear. Risk Factors Relating to This Offering and Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock Prior to this offering, no market existed for our Class A common stock and we cannot assure you that an active, liquid trading market will develop for our Class A common stock. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our Class A common stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will lead to the development and sustainment of an active trading market on the or otherwise, or how liquid that market might become. A public trading market having the desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers at any given time, such existence being dependent upon the individual decisions of buyers and sellers over which neither we nor any market maker has control. If an active and liquid trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any shares of our Class A common stock that you purchase in this initial public 36 Table of Contents offering and the value of our Class A common stock may be materially adversely affected. The initial public offering price for the shares of our Class A common stock was determined by negotiations between us, the selling stockholders and the representatives of the underwriters, and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the open market following this offering. The market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the initial public offering price, and you may not be able to sell your shares of our Class A common stock at or above the price you paid in this offering, or at all. An inactive and illiquid trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares of our Class A common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our Class A common stock as consideration. You will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the shares you purchase in this offering, and you will suffer additional dilution if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock. If you purchase shares of our Class A common stock in this offering you will experience immediate and substantial dilution, as the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock will be substantially greater than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock. If you purchase our Class A common stock in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $ per share, representing the difference between our pro forma net tangible book deficit per share after giving effect to this offering and the initial public offering price. Your percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our board of directors will have the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options, Class B common stock, Class C common stock or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. We may issue such capital stock to meet a number of our business needs, including funding any potential acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Issuances of Class A common stock, Class B common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock. If the market price of our Class A common stock is volatile after this offering, you could lose a significant part of your investment. Securities markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations, so even if a trading market develops, the market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. The market price of our Class A common stock will be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above in "Risk Factors Relating to Our Business" and including, but not limited to, the following:  the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A common stock after this offering or changes in financial estimates by analysts;  the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our Class A common stock;  strategic actions by us or our competitors;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors; 37 Table of Contents  variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;  variations in Altice N.V.'s operating results and the market price of its shares;  additions or departures of key personnel;  general economic and stock market conditions;  risks related to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;  changes in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;  regulatory, legal or political developments;  changes in accounting principles;  changes in tax legislation and regulations;  litigation and governmental investigations;  terrorist acts;  future sales of our Class A common stock or other securities;  default under agreements governing our indebtedness; and  investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our Class A common stock relative to other investment alternatives. As a result of these and other factors, investors in our Class A common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the initial offering price or may not be able to resell them at all. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our Class A common stock is low. Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of Class A common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants contained in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness and may be limited by covenants contained in any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell our Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. For more information, see "Dividend Policy." Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market following this offering could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline. After this offering, the sale of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the prevailing market price of shares of our Class A common stock to decline. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may 38 Table of Contents occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Upon consummation of this offering we will have a total of shares of Class A common stock outstanding. All of the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Any shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act ("Rule 144"), including Altice N.V. and its affiliates, may be sold only in compliance with the limitations described in "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." The remaining shares will be "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale following the consummation of this offering. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144, as described in "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." We and our officers, directors, and holders of substantially all of our common stock have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of our or their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of . Upon the expiration of the lock-up agreements, the remaining shares will be eligible for resale, which would be subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement, our existing owners have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of our Class A common stock, or shares of Class A common stock issuable on conversion of shares of Class B common stock under the Securities Act. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, our existing owners could cause the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock to decline. Following completion of this offering, the shares covered by registration rights would represent approximately % of our outstanding Class A common stock (or %, if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares). Registration of any of these outstanding shares of Class A common stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." In addition, we intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock issued pursuant to the Altice USA 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan. Any such Form S-8 registration statements will automatically become effective upon filing. Shares registered under any such registration statement would be available for sale in the public market following the effective date, unless such shares are subject to vesting restrictions with us, Rule 144 restrictions applicable to our affiliates or the lock-up agreements described elsewhere in this prospectus. As restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of our Class A common stock could drop significantly if the holders of Class A common stock sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our Class A common stock or other securities. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our Class A common stock or Class C common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you. 39 Table of Contents The tri-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with Altice N.V. and its affiliates. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. Shares of Class B common stock will not automatically convert to shares of Class A common stock upon transfer to a third party. Following this offering, our Class B common stock will have twenty-five votes per share and our Class A common stock, which is the stock we are offering in this offering, will have one vote per share. If we issue any shares of Class C common stock, they will be non-voting. Immediately following the completion of this offering, Altice N.V. and its affiliates will indirectly hold in the aggregate % of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the twenty-five to one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and Class A common stock, Altice N.V. and its affiliates will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until such date as the holders of a majority of our Class B common stock choose to voluntarily convert their shares into shares of Class A common stock and cease to own shares of our capital stock entitling them to cast a majority of the outstanding votes. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. The disparate voting rights of our common stock may also prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. For additional information, see "Description of Capital Stock." Shares of our Class B common stock will be convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at the option of the holder at any time. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not provide for the automatic conversion of shares of Class B common stock upon transfer under any circumstances. The holders of Class B common stock thus will be free to transfer them without converting them into shares of Class A common stock. Altice N.V. and Patrick Drahi will continue to control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. The beneficial ownership interests of Altice N.V. following the offering will depend on the price of the shares offered, the number of shares sold and the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. Immediately following this offering, Altice N.V. will own % of our Class B common stock which will represent approximately % of the voting power of our capital stock, or % if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares. So long as Altice N.V. continues to own common stock representing a substantial portion of the voting power of our capital stock, Altice N.V. and, through his control of Altice N.V., Patrick Drahi, will be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and thereby influence our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, Altice N.V. may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment or improve its financial condition, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, Altice N.V. could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets. 40 Table of Contents So long as Altice N.V. continues to hold a substantial portion of the voting power of our capital stock, Altice N.V. and, through his control of Altice N.V., Patrick Drahi, will continue to be able to significantly influence or effectively control our decisions. In addition, Altice N.V. will be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of the Company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of the Company. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of our Class A common stock as part of a sale of the Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, we have entered into agreements with affiliates of Altice N.V. pursuant to which they provide us software and network equipment, design and development services, technical services and support for our customers and proprietary content, for which we compensate them on a regular basis. If conflicts arise between us and Altice N.V., these conflicts could be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to us and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions." In addition, if Altice N.V. ceases to control us or we otherwise lose access to the services and expertise available to us through Altice N.V., including for example ATS and Altice Labs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control transaction. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that will be in effect on the closing of this offering may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions will provide for, among other things:  a tri-class common stock structure, as a result of which Altice N.V. generally will be able to control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets;  the ability of our board of directors to, without further action by our stockholders, fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of up to an aggregate of shares of preferred stock in one or more series and authorize their issuance; and  the ability of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock to call a special meeting of stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party's offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock. See "Description of Capital Stock." In addition, so long as Altice N.V. continues to hold a significant amount of our combined voting power it will be able to prevent a change of control of the Company. Holders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon 41 Table of Contents holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders. We will continue to be a "controlled company" within the meaning of the rules of the . As a result, we will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies. After completion of this offering, Altice N.V. will continue to control a majority of the voting power of our capital stock. As a result, we will be a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the . Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a "controlled company" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:  the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consists of "independent directors" as defined under the rules of the ;  the requirement that our director nominees be selected, or recommended for our board of directors' selection by a nominating/governance committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees' purpose and responsibilities;  the requirement that the compensation of our executive officers be determined, or recommended to our board of directors for determination, by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees' purpose and responsibilities; and  the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees. Following the completion of this offering and for so long as we are a "controlled company," we intend to utilize these exemptions. As a result, we will not have a majority of independent directors, our nominating/corporate governance committee and compensation committee will not consist entirely of independent directors and such committees will not be subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the . We will incur increased costs as a result of becoming a public company and in the administration of our organizational structure. As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the and other applicable securities laws and regulations. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and 42 Table of Contents related rules implemented by the SEC. Following the completion of this offering, we will incur ongoing periodic expenses in connection with the administration of our organizational structure. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Class A common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. We are not currently required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and therefore are not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm that addresses the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. During the course of our testing, we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer, and we could become subject to investigations by , the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. The trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. In addition, Altice N.V. is a publicly listed company traded on the Euronext and is subject to equity market volatility, general economic conditions and regulatory changes which may adversely affect the market price of the Altice N.V. ordinary shares. Altice N.V. is currently controlled by Next Alt S.á r.l., a company that is controlled by Patrick Drahi. Next Alt S.á r.l. could sell a substantial number of ordinary shares of Altice N.V. in the public market and such sales, or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially and adversely affect the market price of Altice N.V.'s ordinary shares. A 43 Table of Contents decrease in Altice N.V. share price could negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock. We could be subject to securities class action litigation. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in the price of our Class A common stock, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and results of operations and divert management's attention and resources from our business. We will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds to us from this offering and may not use them effectively. We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us from this offering, including for any of the purposes described in the section titled "Use of Proceeds," and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being used appropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government that may not generate a high yield to our stockholders. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"); (iv) any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (v) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated bylaws permit our board of directors to waive the exclusive forum provision and consent to suit in other jurisdictions. Unless waived, this exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 44 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements."

Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "may," "will," "should," "could," "seeks," "potential," "continue," "intends," "plans" and similar words and terms used in the discussion of future operating results, future financial performance and future events identify forward-looking statements in this prospectus. All of these forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs about future events.

We operate in a highly competitive, consumer and technology driven and rapidly changing business that is affected by government regulation and economic, strategic, technological, political and social conditions. Various factors could adversely affect our operations, business or financial results in the future and cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed under "Risk Factors" in this prospectus. In addition, important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements include:  competition for broadband, pay television and telephony customers from existing competitors (such as broadband communications companies, DBS providers and Internet-based providers) and new competitors entering our footprint;  changes in consumer preferences, laws and regulations or technology that may cause us to change our operational strategies;  increased difficulty negotiating programming and retransmission agreements on favorable terms, if at all, resulting in increased costs to us and/or the loss of popular programming;  increasing programming costs and delivery expenses related to our products and services;  our ability to achieve anticipated customer and revenue growth, to successfully introduce new products and services and to implement our growth strategy;  our ability to complete our capital investment plans on time and on budget, including our five-year plan to build a FTTH network and deploy our new home communications hub;  the effects of economic conditions or other factors which may negatively affect our customers' demand for our products and services;  the effects of industry conditions;  demand for advertising on our cable systems;  our substantial indebtedness and debt service obligations;  adverse changes in the credit market;  financial community and rating agency perceptions of our business, operations, financial condition and the industries in which we operate;  the restrictions contained in our financing agreements;  our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations; 45 Table of Contents  fluctuations in interest rates which may cause our interest expense to vary from quarter to quarter;  technical failures, equipment defects, physical or electronic break-ins to our services, computer viruses and similar problems;  the disruption or failure of our network, information systems or technologies as a result of computer hacking, computer viruses, "cyber-attacks," misappropriation of data, outages, natural disasters and other material events;  our ability to obtain necessary hardware, software, communications equipment and services and other items from our vendors at reasonable costs;  our ability to effectively integrate acquisitions and to maximize expected operating efficiencies from our acquisitions or as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby;  significant unanticipated increases in the use of bandwidth-intensive Internet-based services;  the outcome of litigation and other proceedings; and  other risks and uncertainties inherent in our cable and other broadband communications businesses and our other businesses, including those listed under the caption "Risk Factors" in this prospectus. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be different from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements may be found under "Risk Factors" contained in this prospectus. These factors and other risk factors disclosed in this prospectus are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus are made only as of the date of this prospectus. Except to the extent required by law, we do not undertake, and specifically decline any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of such statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in this prospectus and have filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 46 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $ , based on an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. An increase or decrease in the initial public offering price by $ per share above or below the mid-point of the proposed range would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $ , as applicable, in net proceeds to us assuming the number of shares offered by us stays constant. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. We currently intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering for general corporate purposes. 47 Table of Contents DIVIDEND POLICY During fiscal year 2015, Cablevision, our predecessor company, paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share to holders of both Cablevision's Class A common stock and Class B common stock on April 3, 2015, June 12, 2015 and September 10, 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we declared combined cash dividends of approximately $445 million to our stockholders of which approximately $365 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2016 and approximately $80 million was paid in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, in April 2017, we declared and paid a cash dividend of approximately $170 million to our stockholders. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the operation, development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made in the sole and absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon then existing conditions, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. See "Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to This Offering and Ownership of Our Class A Common StockBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it." In addition, we are a holding company which does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, our ability to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries. The terms of certain debt instruments to which our subsidiaries are a party currently limit, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, their ability and the ability of their restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated debt, (ii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates and (iii) enter into agreements that restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries or the repayment of intercompany loans and advances. See "Description of Certain Indebtedness." 48 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of December 31, 2016:  on an actual basis from continuing operations; and  on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the sale by us of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering, based on a public offering price of $ per share, the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the underwriting discount and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, and the use of the net proceeds therefrom as described in "Use of Proceeds." The as adjusted information below is illustrative only and our capitalization following the completion of this offering will be adjusted based on the actual offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with "Selected Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data," "Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the financial statements and related notes and the financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. The as adjusted column assumes that the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2016 (Dollars in thousands, except share data) Actual As Adjusted (Unaudited) Cash and cash equivalents $ 486,792 $ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Debt: Short-term debt: Credit facility debt, senior notes and debentures, capital lease obligations and notes payable 979,635 Collateralized indebtedness 622,332 Long-term debt: Credit facility debt, senior notes and debentures, capital lease obligations and notes payable 20,014,361 Collateralized indebtedness 663,737 Notes payable to affiliates and related parties 1,750,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total debt 24,030,065 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Redeemable equity 68,147 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity: Class A common stock: $0.01 par value, shares authorized, issued and outstanding Class B common stock: $0.01 par value, shares authorized, issued and outstanding Class C common stock: $0.01 par value, shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding Common stock: $0.01 par value, 1,000 shares authorized, 100 shares issued and outstanding Additional paid-in capital 3,003,554 Accumulated deficit (975,978 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Accumulated other comprehensive income 1,979 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Non-controlling interest 287 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total equity 2,029,842 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total capitalization $ 26,128,054 $ Total debt excluding collateralized indebtedness 22,743,996 Net debt excluding collateralized indebtedness and notes payable to affiliates and related parties(1) $ 20,507,204 $ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (1) Net debt is total debt less cash and cash equivalents. 49 Table of Contents DILUTION If you invest in shares of our Class A common stock in this offering, your investment will be immediately diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share of our Class A common stock and the net tangible book deficit per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the per share offering price of the shares of Class A common stock is substantially in excess of the net tangible book value per share attributable to the shares of our common stock held by existing owners. Our net tangible book deficit as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $ , or $ per share of common stock. We calculate net tangible book deficit per share by taking the amount of our total tangible assets, reduced by the amount of our total liabilities and then dividing that amount by the total number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding after giving effect to this offering. After giving effect to the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our net tangible book deficit as of December 31, 2016 would have been $ , or $ per share of common stock. This represents an immediate decrease in net tangible book deficit of $ per share of common stock to our existing owners and an immediate and substantial dilution of $ per share of Class A common stock to investors in this offering at the assumed initial public offering price. The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share of common stock basis to new investors assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock: Initial public offering price per share $ Net tangible book deficit per share as of December 31, 2016 $ Decrease in net tangible book deficit per share attributable to new investors in this offering $ As adjusted net tangible book deficit per share after giving effect to this offering $ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Dilution per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering $ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ A $1.00 decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase our net tangible book deficit per share of our common stock by $ , assuming that the number of shares offered, as set forth on the cover of this prospectus, remains the same, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of shares of our Class A common stock by the selling stockholders. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock in full, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book deficit per share will be $ per share, the decrease in pro forma net tangible book deficit per share attributable to new investors in this offering will be $ per share and the dilution per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering will be $ per share. See "Use of Proceeds." The table below summarizes as of December 31, 2016, on a pro forma as adjusted basis described above, the number of shares of our common stock, the total consideration and the average price per share (i) paid to us by our existing stockholders (determined based on our additional paid-in capital) and (ii) to be paid by new investors purchasing our Class A common stock in this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock), before 50 Table of Contents deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us and assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share, the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus.

(c) Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we 55 Table of Contents count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. (d) Represents the number of customers that subscribe to three of our services divided by total residential customer relationships. (e) Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by homes passed. (f) Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the fourth quarter of each year presented derived from the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers for the respective quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period.

Overview Our Business We deliver broadband, pay television, telephony services, Wi-Fi hotspot access, proprietary content and advertising services to approximately 4.9 million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich broadband network with more than 8.5 million homes passed as of December 31, 2016. We have two reportable segments: Cablevision and Cequel. Cablevision provides broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential and business customers in and around the New York metropolitan area. Cequel provides broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential and business customers in the south-central United States, with approximately 97% of its customers located in the ten states of Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona, California, Missouri and Ohio. Recent Transactions On December 21, 2015, Altice N.V. acquired approximately 70% of the total outstanding equity interests in Cequel. The consideration for the acquired equity interests was $3,973,528. Following the closing of the Cequel Acquisition, BCP and CPPIB retained 30% of Cequel's outstanding capital stock. In June 2016, Cequel was contributed to Altice USA. On June 21, 2016, a subsidiary of Altice N.V. merged with and into Cablevision, with Cablevision as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Altice USA. In connection with the merger, each outstanding share of Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (together, the "CNYG Shares"), received $34.90 in cash without interest, less applicable tax withholdings. The total consideration for the CNYG Shares and equity-based awards amounted to approximately $9,958,323. In July 2016, we completed the sale of a 75% interest in Newsday LLC and retained the remaining 25% ownership interest. Effective July 7, 2016, the operating results of Newsday are no longer consolidated with our results and our 25% interest in the operating results of Newsday is recorded on the equity basis. Key Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. See "Risk Factors," "Industry Overview," and "Business" for more information. We derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential subscribers of our broadband, pay television and telephony services. We also derive revenue from equipment rental, DVR, VOD, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential broadband, pay television and telephony services accounted for 45%, 27% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and pay television services. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 14% of our consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, which 67 Table of Contents accounted for 4% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 accounted for approximately 1% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers to our services, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, programming package upgrades by our pay television customers, speed tier upgrades by our broadband customers, and acquisitions of cable systems that result in the addition of new subscribers. Our ability to increase the number of subscribers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates. We operate in a highly competitive consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite-delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content, and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. Our competitors include AT&T and its DirecTV subsidiary, CenturyLink, DISH Network and Frontier and Verizon. Consumers' selection of an alternate source of service, whether due to economic constraints, technological advances or preference, negatively impacts the demand for our services. For more information on our competitive landscape, see "Risk Factors," "Industry Overview" and "BusinessCompetition." Our programming costs, which are the most significant component of our operating expenses, have increased and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases and new channel launches. See "Results of Operations" below for more information regarding our key factors impacting our revenues and operating expenses. Historically, we have made substantial investments in our network and the development of new and innovative products and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors and may continue to do so in the future. We have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Cablevision footprint and part of our Cequel footprint. We may incur greater than anticipated capital expenditures in connection with this initiative, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience delays and business disruptions or encounter other challenges to executing it as planned. See "Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Expenditures" for additional information regarding our capital expenditures.

In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our cable distribution network. For Cequel, broadband services were not available to approximately 100 homes passed and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 homes passed. (b) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's services. 71 Table of Contents (c) Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. (d) Represents the number of customers that subscribe to three of our services divided by total residential customer relationships. (e) Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by homes passed. (f) Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the fourth quarter of each year presented derived from the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers for the respective quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period. (g) The metrics for Cequel presented in the table above have been adjusted from previously reported amounts to conform to the methodology used to calculate the equivalent Cablevision metrics. 72 Table of Contents The following table sets forth certain operating information by segment for the year ended December 31, 2016: December 31, 2016 Cablevision Cequel Total Revenue(a): Residential: Pay TV $ 1,638,691 $ 1,120,525 $ 2,759,216 Broadband 782,615 834,414 1,617,029 Telephony 376,034 153,939 529,973 Business services and wholesale 468,632 350,909 819,541 Advertising 157,331 88,371 245,702 Other 20,749 25,002 45,751 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total revenue 3,444,052 2,573,160 6,017,212 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating expenses: Programming and other direct costs 1,164,925 735,069 1,899,994 Other operating expenses 1,028,447 688,404 1,716,851 Restructuring and other expense (credits) 212,150 28,245 240,395 Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) 963,665 736,641 1,700,306 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating income $ 74,865 $ 384,801 $ 459,666 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts by product to reflect the current presentation.

Pay television is derived principally through monthly charges to residential subscribers of our pay television services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, and programming package upgrades. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, pay television revenue amounted to $4,227,222 and $4,260,631 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $33,409 (1%) is comprised of a pro forma decrease of $36,294 (1%) for our Cablevision segment, partially offset by a pro forma increase of $2,885 for our Cequel segment. On a pro forma basis, pay television revenue for our Cablevision segment amounted to $3,106,697 and $3,142,991 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma decrease of $36,294 (1%) was due primarily to a decline in pay television customers and a decrease due to a pay-per-view boxing event that took place in 2015. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in revenue as compared to the prior year due primarily to rate increases for certain pay television services implemented during the first quarter of 2016 and an increase in fees charged to restore suspended services. On a pro forma basis, pay television revenue for our Cequel segment amounted to $1,120,525 and $1,117,640 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase of $2,885 was due primarily to increases in revenue resulting from certain rate increases (including an increase for retransmission programming and sports programming charges), the impact of incremental pay television service level changes and an increase in HD/DVR service revenue, partially offset by a decline in pay television customers, a decrease in premium, pay-per-view and VOD purchases, and a decrease in converter rental revenue as compared to the 2015 period. We believe our pay television customer declines noted in the table above are largely attributable to competition, particularly from Verizon in our Cablevision footprint and DBS providers in our Cequel footprint, as well as competition from companies that deliver video content over the Internet directly to customers. These factors are expected to continue to impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future. Broadband Revenue Actual 2016 Broadband revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1,617,029 of which $782,615 was derived from the Cablevision segment from the date of its acquisition and $834,414 relates to Cequel. Broadband revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential subscribers of our broadband services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, and speed tier upgrades. 74 Table of Contents Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, broadband revenue amounted to $2,290,039 and $2,005,012 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On a pro forma basis, broadband revenue increased $285,027 (14%) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared the prior year and is comprised of a pro forma increase of $151,707 (12%) for our Cablevision segment and a pro forma increase of $133,320 (19%) for our Cequel segment. On a pro forma basis, broadband revenue for our Cablevision segment amounted to $1,455,625 and $1,303,918 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase of $151,707 (12%) was due to rate increases for certain broadband services implemented during the first quarter of 2016, an increase in broadband customers, and an increase in fees charged to restore suspended services. On a pro forma basis, broadband revenue for our Cequel segment amounted to $834,414 and $701,094 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase of $133,320 (19%) was due primarily to an increase in broadband customers, an increase in rates, an increase resulting from the impact of service level changes and an increase in residential home networking revenue. Telephony Revenue Actual 2016 Telephony revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $529,973 of which $376,034 was derived from the Cablevision segment from the date of its acquisition and $153,939 relates to Cequel. Telephony revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential subscribers of our telephony services. Revenue increases are derived primarily from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers, and additional services sold to our existing subscribers. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, telephony revenue amounted to $872,115 and $912,002 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On a pro forma basis, telephony revenue decreased $39,887 (4%) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and is comprised of a pro forma decrease of $30,005 (4%) and $9,882 (6%) for our Cablevision and Cequel segment, respectively. On a pro forma basis, telephony revenue for our Cablevision segment amounted to $718,176 and $748,181 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma decrease of $30,005 (4%) was due primarily to a decline in telephony customers and a decline in international calling. On a pro forma basis, telephony revenue for our Cequel segment amounted to $153,939 and $163,821 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma decrease of $9,882 (6%) was due primarily to lower rates offered to customers. Business Services and Wholesale Revenue Actual 2016 Business services and wholesale revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $819,541 of which $468,632 was derived from the Cablevision segment from the date of its acquisition and $350,909 relates to Cequel. Business services and wholesale revenue is derived primarily from the sale of fiber based telecommunications services to the business market, and the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to SMBs. 75 Table of Contents Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, business services and wholesale revenue amounted to $1,230,643 and $1,158,840 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On a pro forma basis, business services and wholesale revenue increased $71,803 (6%) for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and is comprised of a pro forma increase of $45,580 (5%) for our Cablevision segment and a pro forma increase of $26,223 (8%) for our Cequel segment. On a pro forma basis, business services and wholesale revenue for our Cablevision segment amounted to $879,734 and $834,154 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase of $45,580 (5%) was due primarily to rate increases for certain broadband services implemented during the first quarter of 2016, and increase in broadband customers and an increase in Ethernet revenue resulting from a larger number of services installed, partially offset by reduced traditional voice and data services. On a pro forma basis, business services and wholesale revenue for our Cequel segment amounted to $350,909 and $324,686 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase of $26,223 (8%) was primarily due to higher rates and a larger number of customers for broadband services, higher rates and a larger number of customers for telephony services, an increase in certain video rates (including an increase for retransmission programming charges), and an increase in revenue from premium, pay-per-view and VOD purchases. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in high-speed commercial carrier services. Advertising Revenue Actual 2016 Advertising services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $245,702 of which $157,331 was derived from the Cablevision segment from the date of its acquisition and $88,371 was derived from our Cequel segment. Advertising services revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, advertising revenue amounted to $365,429 and $345,498 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On a pro forma basis, advertising revenue increased $19,931 (6%) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and is comprised of a pro forma increase of $19,226 (7%) for our Cablevision segment and a pro forma increase of $705 (1%) for our Cequel segment. On a pro forma basis, advertising revenue for our Cablevision segment amounted to $277,058 and $257,832 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase in advertising revenue of $19,226 (7%) for our Cablevision segment was due primarily to an increase in advertising sales to the political sector. On a pro forma basis, advertising revenue for our Cequel segment amounted to $88,371 and $87,666 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a pro forma increase of $705 (1%). Other Revenue Actual 2016 Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $45,751 of which $20,749 was derived from the Cablevision segment from the date of its acquisition and $25,002 was derived from our Cequel segment. Other revenue primarily includes revenue recognized by Newsday, which was consolidated 76 Table of Contents through July 7, 2016, affiliation fees paid by cable operators for carriage of our News 12 Networks, and other miscellaneous revenue streams. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, other revenue amounted to $169,368 and $283,874 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On a pro forma basis, other revenue decreased $114,506 (40%) for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and is comprised of a pro forma decrease of $114,103 (44%) for our Cablevision segment and a pro forma decrease of $403 (2%) for our Cequel segment. On a pro forma basis other revenue for our Cablevision segment amounted to $144,366 and $258,469 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma decrease of $114,103 (44%) was primarily due to Cablevision no longer consolidating the operating results of Newsday as a result of the sale of a 75% interest in Newsday, effective July 7, 2016. The Company's 25% interest in the operating results of Newsday is recorded on the equity basis. On a pro forma basis, other revenue for our Cequel segment amounted to $25,002 and $25,405 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a pro forma decrease of $403 (2%). Programming and Other Direct Costs Actual 2016 Programming and other direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $1,899,994 of which $1,164,925 relate to our Cablevision segment from the date of acquisition and $735,069 relate to our Cequel segment. Programming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-subscriber basis. These costs typically rise due to increases in contractual rates and new channel launches and are also impacted by changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue derived from the provision of pay television service over our cable systems, which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, programming and other direct costs amounted to $2,988,549 and $2,982,005 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Programming and other direct costs on a pro forma basis amounted to $2,253,480 and $2,269,290 for our Cablevision segment and amounted 77 Table of Contents to $735,069 and $712,715 for our Cequel segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase of $6,544 is attributable to the following: Cablevision segment: Decrease in costs primarily related to the sale of Newsday in July 2016 $ (54,133 ) Decrease in call completion and transport costs primarily due to lower level of activity (20,443 ) Decrease in cost of sales (which includes a lower cost or market valuation adjustment of $17,382 related to wireless handset inventory from 2015, partially offset by the bulk sale of handset inventory of $5,445 during the first quarter of 2016) (10,238 ) Increase in franchise and other fees due primarily to increases in rates in certain areas, partially offset by lower video customers 3,140 Increase in programming costs due primarily to contractual rate increases, partially offset by lower video customers 65,760 Other net increases 104 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (15,810 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cequel segment: Increase in programming costs due primarily to contractual rate increases, partially offset by lower video customers. 42,325 Decrease in digital programming, premium channels and pay-per-view (8,932 ) Decrease in costs associated with carrier circuits and local exchange carrier costs (7,015 ) Decrease in subscriber line costs associated with Operation Reliant (as later defined) (330 ) Other net decreases (3,694 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 22,354 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 6,544 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Programming costs Programming costs aggregated $1,576,519 for the year ended December 31, 2016 on an actual basis and on a pro forma basis aggregated $2,468,273 and $2,370,860 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our programming costs increased 4% on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to an increase in contractual programming rates, partially offset by a decrease in pay television customers. Our programming costs in 2017 will continue to be impacted by changes in programming rates, which we expect to increase by high single digits, and by changes in the number of pay television customers. Other Operating Expenses Actual 2016 Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,716,851, of which $1,028,447 relate to our Cablevision segment from the date of acquisition and $688,404 relate to our Cequel segment. Other operating expenses include staff costs and employee benefits including salaries of company employees and related taxes, benefits and other employee related expenses. Other operating expenses also include network management and field service costs, which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections and other costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers which are impacted by general cost increases for contractors, insurance and other various expenses. Customer installation and repair and maintenance costs may fluctuate as a result of changes in the level of activities and the utilization of contractors as compared to employees. Also, customer installation costs fluctuate as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize changes. 78 Table of Contents Network repair and maintenance and utility costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes. Other operating expenses also include costs related to the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities and sales and marketing costs, which include advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs vary period to period and certain of these costs, such as sales and marketing, may increase with intense competition. Additionally, other operating expenses include various other administrative costs, including legal fees, and product development costs. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, other operating expenses amounted to $2,853,821 and $3,499,669 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other operating expenses on a pro forma basis amounted to $2,165,417 and $2,546,319 for our Cablevision segment and amounted to $688,404 and $953,350 for our Cequel segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma decrease of $645,848 (18%) for the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the following: Cablevision segment: Decrease primarily in employee related costs related to the elimination of certain positions, lower net benefits and an increase in capitalizable activity, partially offset by merit increases $ (190,274 ) Decrease in costs primarily related to the sale of Newsday in July 2016 (73,650 ) Decrease in share-based compensation (26,788 ) Decrease in expenses related to long-term incentive plan awards (14,827 ) Decrease in legal costs (23,878 ) Decrease in sales and marketing costs (20,875 ) Decrease in repairs and maintenance costs relating to our operations and facilities (17,153 ) Decrease in contractor costs due primarily to lower truck rolls (10,611 ) Settlement of a class action legal matter in 2015 (9,500 ) Decrease in product development costs and product consulting fees (4,215 ) Increase in Altice management fee for certain executive services 10,556 Other net increases 313 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (380,902 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cequel segment: Decrease in share-based compensation (214,848 ) Decrease in employee salaries and benefits including bonus, overtime and other employee related costs primarily relating to the decrease in headcount occurring subsequent to the Cequel Acquisition (17,984 ) Decrease in the cost of residential customer installations (10,120 ) Decrease in consulting and professional fees (9,847 ) Decrease in management fee relating to certain executive, administrative and managerial services provided to the Company prior to the Cequel Acquisition (9,987 ) Decrease in marketing costs (9,424 ) Decrease in general and administrative costs (8,194 ) Decrease in fleet operating costs (2,261 ) Increase in group health insurance costs 9,829 Increase in Altice management fee for certain executive services 9,704 Other net decreases (1,814 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (264,946 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ (645,848 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 79 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Expense (Credits) Actual 2016 Restructuring and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $240,395 ($212,150 for our Cablevision segment and $28,245 for our Cequel segment) primarily relate to severance and other employee related costs resulting from headcount reductions related to initiatives which commenced in 2016 that are intended to simplify the Company's organizational structure. We currently anticipate that additional restructuring expenses will be recognized as we continue to analyze our organizational structure. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, restructuring and other expense (credits) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $229,117 ($201,529 for our Cablevision segment and $27,588 for our Cequel segment) and $(1,649) for our Cablevision segment, respectively. The pro forma restructuring expense for 2016 is primarily related to severance and other employee related costs resulting from headcount reductions related to initiatives which commenced in 2016 that are intended to simplify the Company's organizational structure at both Cablevision and Cequel. The restructuring credit for 2015 related to prior restructuring plans at Cablevision. Depreciation and Amortization Actual 2016 Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1,700,306, of which $963,665 relate to our Cablevision segment from the date of acquisition and $736,641 relate to our Cequel segment. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 includes depreciation and amortization related to the step-up in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition on June 21, 2016 and the Cequel Acquisition on December 21, 2015, partially offset by certain assets being retired or becoming fully depreciated. Altice N.V. is currently evaluating the adoption of a global brand which, if adopted, could reduce the remaining useful lives of our trade name intangibles, which would increase amortization expense. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, depreciation and amortization (including impairments) amounted to $2,345,775 and $2,442,235 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma decrease of $96,460 (4%) for the year ended December 31, 2016 is comprised of a $39,233 (2%) pro forma decrease for our Cablevision segment and a pro forma decrease of $57,227 (8%) for our Cequel segment. The pro forma decrease for both segments is primarily due to lower amortization expense for certain intangible assets that are being amortized using an accelerated method and lower depreciation for certain assets being retired or becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by depreciation on new asset additions. Adjusted EBITDA Actual 2016 Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $2,414,735. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net loss excluding income taxes, loss from discontinued operations, other non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, loss on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments, interest expense (including cash interest expense), 80 Table of Contents interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses. See reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA above. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA amounted to $3,352,045 and $2,769,520 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase of $582,525 (21%) consists of a pro forma increase of $376,701 (21%) for our Cablevision segment and a pro forma increase of $205,824 (21%) for our Cequel segment. The pro forma increase was due primarily to an increase in revenue, and a decrease in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other expense and share-based compensation), as discussed above. Interest Expense, net Actual 2016 Interest expense, net was $1,442,730 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and includes interest on debt issued to finance the Cablevision Acquisition and Cequel Acquisition, as well as interest on debt assumed in connection with these acquisitions. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, interest expense, net amounted to $1,791,064 and $1,715,950 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The pro forma increase of $75,114 (4%) is primarily attributable to an increase of $33,549 due to the change in average debt balances, $31,436 due primarily to an increase in the amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts/premiums resulting recording debt at fair value in connection with the Cablevision and Cequel Acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in interest income of $2,068. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" discussion below for a detail of our borrower groups. Gain on Investments, net Actual 2016 Gain on investments, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $141,896 consists primarily of the increase in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company for the period from the date of the Cablevision Acquisition. The effects of these gains are partially offset by the losses on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $271,886 and $(30,208), respectively, assuming the Cablevision Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015 and consists primarily of the increase or decrease in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are partially offset by the (losses) gains on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below. Gain (Loss) on Equity Derivative Contracts, net Actual 2016 Loss on equity derivative contracts, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $(53,696) consists of unrealized and realized gains (losses) due to the change in fair value of equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company for the period from the date of the 81 Table of Contents Cablevision Acquisition. The effects of these loss are offset by the gain on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain (loss) on investments, net discussed above. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, gain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $(89,979) and $104,927, respectively, assuming the Cablevision Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015 and consists of unrealized and realized gains (losses) due to the change in fair value of equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. Loss on interest rate swap contracts Loss on interest rate swap contracts was $72,961 for the year ended December 31, 2016 on an actual and pro forma basis and represents the decrease in fair value of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps entered into by our Cequel segment in June 2016. The objective of these swaps is to cover the exposure to changes in the market interest rate of the $1,500,000 principal amount of the Cequel 2026 Senior Secured Notes. These swap contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt and Write-off of Deferred Financing Costs Loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $127,649 includes primarily the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized discount related to the prepayment of $1,290,500 outstanding under the term credit facility at Cablevision. On a pro forma basis, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,735. Income Tax Expense Actual 2016 Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $259,666. In connection with the contribution of Cequel to the Company in June 2016, the Company was required to re-measure deferred taxes of Cequel at a higher overall rate, resulting in additional deferred tax expense of $153,660. The impact of the nondeductible share-based compensation related to the Company's carried unit plan resulted in additional tax expense of $5,029. Absent these items, the effective tax rate would have been 38%. Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $406,886. Excluding the impact of the nondeductible share-based compensation related to the Company's carried unit plan of $5,029, the effective tax rate would have been 39%. On a pro forma basis, income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $498,567. In April 2015, corporate income tax changes were enacted for both New York State and the City of New York. Those changes included a provision whereby investment income will be subject to higher taxes. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2015, Cablevision recorded deferred tax expense of $16,334 to remeasure the deferred tax liability for the investment in Comcast common stock and associated derivative securities. During 2015, Cequel recorded tax expense related to non-cash equity compensation of $107,143. Absent these items, the effective tax rate would have been 39%. Loss From Discontinued Operations Pro Forma 2016 Compared to Pro Forma 2015 On a pro forma basis, loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $12,541, net of income taxes, and primarily reflects an expense related to the settlement of a legal matter relating to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, a business whose operations were previously discontinued. 82 Table of Contents Results of OperationsCablevision The following discussion regarding Cablevision results of operations has been presented for the periods prior to the Cablevision Acquisition as Cablevision is the predecessor entity.

In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our cable distribution network. 84 Table of Contents (b) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's services. (c) Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. (d) Represents the number of customers that subscribe to three of our services divided by total residential customer relationships. (e) Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by homes passed. (f) Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the fourth quarter of each year presented derived from the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers for the respective quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period. CablevisionComparison of Actual Results for the Periods June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 to Actual Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 and Actual Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014 Pay Television Revenue Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Pay television revenue amounted to $1,638,691 and $1,468,006 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $3,142,991 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Pay television revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by a decline in pay television customers, a decrease due to a pay-per-view boxing event that took place in 2015, partially offset by increases in revenue due primarily to rate increases for certain pay television services implemented during the first quarter of 2016 and an increase in fees charged to restore suspended services. Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Pay television revenue amounted to $3,142,991 and $3,151,872 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease of $8,881 was due primarily to rate increases for certain pay television services implemented during the second quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, and lower net promotional activity as a result of continued disciplined pricing policies. In addition, pay-per-view revenue increased primarily due to a boxing event in 2015. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue due primarily to a decline in pay television customers. We believe our pay television customer declines noted in the table above are largely attributable to intense competition, particularly from Verizon, as well as competition from companies that deliver video content over the Internet directly to customers. Also, the declines are attributable to our disciplined pricing and credit policies. These factors are expected to continue to impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future. 85 Table of Contents Broadband Revenue Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Broadband revenue amounted to $782,615 and $673,010 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,303,918 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Broadband revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by rate increases for certain broadband services implemented during the first quarter of 2016, an increase in broadband customers, and an increase in fees charged to restore suspended services. Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Broadband revenue amounted to $1,303,918 and $1,248,708 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $55,210 (4%) was due to rate increases for certain broadband services implemented during the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower net promotional activity as a result of continued disciplined pricing policies. Broadband revenue also increased due to an increase in broadband customers. Telephony Revenue Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Telephony revenue amounted to $376,034 and $342,142 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $748,181 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Telephony revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by a decline in telephony customers and a decline in international calling. Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Telephony revenue amounted to $748,181 and $743,967 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $4,214 (1%) was due primarily to rate increases for certain telephony services implemented during the second quarter of 2014 and lower net promotional activity as a result of continued disciplined pricing policies. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue due primarily to a decline in telephony customers. Business Services Revenue Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Business services and wholesale revenue amounted to $468,632 and $411,102 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $834,154 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Business services and wholesale revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by rate increases for certain broadband services implemented during the first quarter of 2016, an increase in broadband customers and an increase in Ethernet revenue from an increase in services installed, partially offset by reduced traditional voice and data services. Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Business services and wholesale revenue amounted to $834,154 and $811,926 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $22,228 (3%) was primarily due to rate increases for certain broadband services implemented during the fourth quarter of 2014 and an increase in Ethernet revenue from an increase in services installed, partially offset by reduced traditional voice and data services. 86 Table of Contents Advertising Revenue Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Advertising revenue amounted to $157,331 and $119,727 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $257,832 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Advertising revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 was impacted by an increase in advertising sales to the political sector. Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Advertising revenue amounted to $257,832 and $285,284 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease of $27,452 (10%) was primarily due to a decline in advertising sales to the political and gaming sectors. Other Revenue Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Other revenue amounted to $20,749 and $123,617 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $258,469 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other revenue for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 includes revenue recognized by Newsday through July 7, 2016, affiliation fees paid by cable operators for carriage of our News 12 Networks and other revenue sources. On July 7, 2016, the Company sold a 75% interest in Newsday and as a result no longer consolidates its operating results. As of July 7, 2016, the Company's 25% interest in the operating results of Newsday is recorded on the equity basis. 87 Table of Contents Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Other revenue amounted to $258,469 and $266,800 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease of $8,331 (3%) was primarily due to a decrease in revenues at Newsday due primarily to decreases in advertising revenues driven primarily by competition from other media, partially offset by an increase in circulation revenues. Programming and Other Direct Costs Programming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-subscriber basis. These costs typically rise due to increases in contractual rates and new channel launches and are also impacted by changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue derived from the provision of pay television service over our cable systems, which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. Through July 7, 2016, these costs also included content, production and distribution costs of the Newsday business. Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Programming and other direct costs amounted to $1,164,925 and $1,088,555 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $2,269,290 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Programming and other direct costs for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 were impacted by an increase in programming costs due primarily to contractual rate increases, partially offset by lower video customers. These costs were also impacted by the lower costs related to Newsday (due to the sale of our 75% interest in Newsday in July 2016), lower call completion and transport costs primarily due to lower level of activity, lower cost of sales related to wireless handset inventory and higher franchise and other fees due primarily to increases in rates in certain areas, partially offset by lower pay television customers. Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Programming and other direct costs amounted to $2,269,290 and $2,197,735 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $71,555 (3%) is attributable to the following: 2015 Decrease in costs primarily related Newsday $ (10,143 ) Decrease in call completion and transport costs primarily due to lower level of activity (14,184 ) Increase in cost of sales (which includes a lower cost or market valuation adjustment of $17,382 related to wireless handset inventory from 2015) 20,373 Increase in franchise and other fees due primarily to increases in rates in certain areas, partially offset by lower video customers 4,307 Increase in programming costs due primarily to contractual rate increases and a pay-per-view boxing event in 2015, partially offset by lower video customers 66,942 Other net increases 4,260 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 71,555 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 88 Table of Contents Programming Costs Programming costs aggregated $986,951 and $891,754 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,812,945 and $1,746,003 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our programming costs increased 4% for the 2016 periods and 4% in 2015 due primarily to an increase in contractual programming rates and a pay-per-view boxing event in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in telephony customers. Our programming costs in 2017 will continue to be impacted by changes in programming rates, which we expect to increase by high single digits, and by changes in the number of pay television customers. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses include staff costs and employee benefits including salaries of company employees and related taxes, benefits and other employee-related expenses. Other operating expenses also include network management and field service costs, which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections and other costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers which are impacted by general cost increases for contractors, insurance and other various expenses. Customer installation and repair and maintenance costs may fluctuate as a result of changes in the level of activities and the utilization of contractors as compared to employees. Also, customer installation costs fluctuate as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize changes. Network repair and maintenance and utility costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes. Other operating expenses also include costs related to the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities and sales and marketing costs, which include advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs vary period to period and certain costs, such as sales and marketing, may increase with intense competition. Additionally, other operating expenses include various other administrative costs, including legal fees, and product development costs. Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Other operating expenses amounted to $1,028,447 and $1,136,970 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $2,546,319 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other operating expenses for the Successor and Predecessor periods in 2016 were impacted by a decrease in employee-related costs related to the elimination of certain positions, lower benefits and an increase in capitalizable activity, partially offset by merit increases. These costs were also impacted by the lower costs related to Newsday (due to the sale of our 75% interest in Newsday in July 2016), a decrease in share based compensation, a decrease in long-term incentive plan awards, lower legal costs, lower sales and marketing costs, lower repair and maintenance expenses, lower contractor costs, a settlement of a class action legal matter in 2015, partially offset by an increase in the management fee to Altice N.V. 89 Table of Contents Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Other operating expenses amounted to $2,546,319 and $2,520,582 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $25,737 (1%) is attributable to the following: 2015 Decrease primarily in employee related costs related to the elimination of certain positions, lower net benefits and an increase in capitalizable activity, partially offset by merit increases $ (21,169 ) Decrease in costs primarily related to Newsday (5,294 ) Decrease in expenses related to long-term incentive plan awards (15,120 ) Increase in share-based compensation 18,963 Increase in legal costs 17,548 Increase in sales and marketing costs 9,962 Decrease in repairs and maintenance costs relating to our operations and facilities (1,714 ) Decrease in contractor costs due primarily to lower truck rolls (18,514 ) Settlement of a class action legal matter in 2015 9,500 Increase in product development costs and product consulting fees 29,785 Other net increases 1,790 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 25,737 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Restructuring and Other Expense Restructuring and other expense amounted to $212,150 and $22,223 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $16,213 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2,480 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Restructuring and other expense for the Successor 2016 period is primarily related to severance and other employee related costs resulting from headcount reductions related to initiatives which commenced in the Successor period that are intended to simplify the Company's organizational structure. It is currently anticipated that additional restructuring expenses will be recognized as the Company continues to analyze the organizational structure. The restructuring and other expense for the Predecessor 2016 period is primarily related to transaction costs of $19,924 incurred in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition and adjustments related to prior restructuring plans of $2,299. Restructuring and other expense for 2015 includes transaction costs incurred in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition of $17,862, net of adjustments related to prior restructuring plans of $1,649. The restructuring and other expense of $2,480 for 2014 reflects adjustments related to prior restructuring plans. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) amounted to $963,665 and $414,550 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $865,252 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $866,502 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization for the Successor period in 2016 was impacted by an increase in related to the step-up in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition on June 21, 2016, partially offset by certain assets being retired or becoming fully depreciated. Altice N.V. is currently evaluating the adoption of a global brand which if adopted could reduce the remaining useful life of our trade name intangible, which would increase amortization expense. 90 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization decreased $1,250 in 2015 as compared to the prior year due primarily to certain assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by depreciation of new asset purchases. Adjusted EBITDA Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $1,259,844 and $937,310 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,795,222 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2016 periods was impacted by an increase in revenue, and a decrease in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other expense and share-based compensation), as discussed above. Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $1,795,222 and $1,834,224 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease of $39,002 (2%) for 2015 as compared 2014 was due primarily to an increase in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring and other expense and share-based compensation), partially offset by an increase in revenue as discussed above. Interest Expense, net Successor and Predecessor 2016 compared to Predecessor 2015 Interest expense amounted to $606,347 and $285,508 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, compared to $584,839 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense for the Successor 2016 period includes additional interest related to the debt incurred to finance the Cablevision Acquisition. Predecessor 2015 compared to Predecessor 2014 Interest expense, net amounted to $584,839 and $575,580 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $9,259 (2%) for 2015 and as compared to 2014 is attributable to the following: 2015 Decrease due to change in average debt balances $ (7,941 ) Increase due to change in average interest rates on our indebtedness 16,918 Higher interest income (505 ) Other net increases, primarily amortization of deferred financing costs 787 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 9,259 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" discussion below for a detail of our borrower groups. Gain (Loss) on Investments, net Gain (loss) on investments, net amounted to $141,896 and $129,990 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, and $(30,208) and $129,659 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and reflect the increase or decrease in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are partially offset by the (losses) gains on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below. 91 Table of Contents Gain (Loss) on Equity Derivative Contracts, net Gain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net amounted to $(53,696) and $(36,283) for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, respectively, and $104,927 and $(45,055)for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Gain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net consists of unrealized and realized gains (losses) due to the change in fair value of the Company's equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are offset by the (losses) gains on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain (loss) on investments, net discussed above. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt and Write-off of Deferred Financing Costs Loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs amounted to $102,894 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and $1,735 and $10,120 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Successor 2016 amount includes the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized discount related to the prepayment of $1,290,500 outstanding under the CSC Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision, term credit facility. The 2015 amount includes the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized discount related to the $200,000 repayment of CSC Holdings term B loan facility. The 2014 amount includes $9,618, related to the $750,000 repayment of CSC Holdings' outstanding term B loan facility in May 2014 and the $200,000 repayment in September 2014. In addition, the 2014 amount includes the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of $1,436 and a net gain of $934, net of fees, recognized in connection with the repurchase of Cablevision's outstanding 5.875% senior notes due September 2022. Income Tax Expense Income tax benefit (expense) amounted to $213,065 for the period from June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and $(124,848) for the period from January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. In the Successor period, excluding the impact of the nondeductible share-based compensation of $3,208, the effective tax rate would have been 40%. In the Predecessor period, certain acquisition-related costs were determined to be nondeductible, resulting in additional deferred tax expense of $9,392. Absent this item, the effective tax rate would have been 40%. Income tax expense of $154,872 for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflected an effective tax rate of 45%. In April 2015, corporate income tax changes were enacted for both New York State and the City of New York. Those changes included a provision whereby investment income will be subject to higher taxes. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2015, Cablevision recorded deferred tax expense of $16,334 to remeasure the deferred tax liability for the investment in Comcast common stock and associated derivative securities. Also in 2015, Cablevision recorded tax benefit of $2,630 related to research credits. Absent these items, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have been 41%. Income tax expense of $115,768 for the year ended December 31, 2014, reflected an effective tax rate of 27%. In January 2014, the Internal Revenue Service informed the Company that the consolidated federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 were no longer under examination. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2014, Cablevision recorded a tax benefit of $53,132 associated with the reversal of a noncurrent liability relating to an uncertain tax position. New York State corporate tax reform legislation enacted on March 31, 2014 resulted in tax benefit of $2,050. Also in 2014, Cablevision recorded tax benefit of $2,634 related to research credits. Absent these items, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have been 41%. 92 Table of Contents Loss From Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $12,541, net of income taxes, and primarily reflects an expense related to the settlement of a legal matter relating to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, a business whose operations were previously discontinued. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 amounted to $2,822, net of income taxes and resulted primarily from the settlement of a contingency related to Montana property taxes related to Bresnan Cable.

In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our cable distribution network. For Cequel, broadband services were not available to approximately 100 homes passed and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 homes passed. (b) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's services. (c) Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts 94 Table of Contents are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. (d) Represents the number of customers that subscribe to three of our services divided by total residential customer relationships. (e) Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by homes passed. (f) Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the fourth quarter of each year presented derived from the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers for the respective quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period. (g) The metrics for Cequel presented in the table above have been adjusted from previously reported amounts to conform to the methodology used to calculate the equivalent Cablevision metrics. CequelComparison of Actual Results for the Period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015 to Actual Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Pay Television Revenue Pay television revenue amounted to $33,715 and $1,083,925 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $1,147,455 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Pay television revenue for the 2015 periods was impacted by a decline in pay television customers, decreases in premium and VOD purchases and a decrease in converter rental revenue as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Offsetting these decreases were increases in revenue resulting from certain rate increases (including an increase for retransmission programming and sports programming charges), the impact of incremental pay television service level changes and an increase in HD/DVR service revenue. We believe our video customer declines noted in the table above are largely attributable to competition from DBS providers and from companies that deliver video content over the Internet directly to customers. Broadband Revenue Broadband revenue amounted to $21,133 and $679,961 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $601,801 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Broadband revenue for the 2015 periods was impacted by a continued increase in broadband customers, an increase in rates, an increase resulting from the impact of service level changes and an increase in residential home networking revenue. Telephony Revenue Telephony revenue amounted to $4,905 and $158,916 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $167,838 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Telephony revenue for the 2015 periods was impacted by lower rates offered to customers. 95 Table of Contents Business Services Revenue Business services and wholesale revenue amounted to $9,783 and $314,903 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 (Successor Period) and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $288,386 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Business services and wholesale revenue was impacted by higher commercial rates for broadband services, higher commercial rates and customers for telephony services, an increase in high-speed commercial carrier services revenue, an increase in certain pay television rates including an increase for retransmission programming charges and an increase in revenue from premium, pay-per-view and VOD purchases. Advertising Revenue Advertising revenue amounted to $2,642 and $85,024 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $101,197 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Advertising revenue was impacted by a decline in national advertising sales primarily from political advertising, local ad sales, and lower interconnect revenue. Other Revenue Other revenue amounted to $765 and $24,640 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $24,020 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other revenue includes equipment sales, wire maintenance charges, security revenues and other miscellaneous revenue streams. Other revenue for the 2015 periods was impacted by an increase in tower construction management services and equipment sales revenues, partially offset by a decrease in site development revenue. Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) were $26,586, $872,308 and $930,085 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Operating expenses include programming costs, broadband costs, telephony services costs, and plant and operating costs. Programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, VOD and pay-per-view programming. Programming costs for the 2015 periods were impacted by a decrease in the number of pay television customers and the removal of Viacom programming from our channel line-up, offset in part by higher contractual rates charged by our programming and broadcast vendors and the costs of new channels launched. Broadband costs primarily consist of costs for bandwidth connectivity. Broadband costs were impacted by increases in circuit costs to support growth in our residential and commercial broadband business, but were offset in part by decreases in backbone costs and broadband content costs. Telephony service costs, including delivery and other costs, for the 2015 periods were impacted by the decrease in subscriber line costs associated with Operation Reliant, described below. Plant and operating costs consist primarily of employee costs related to wages and benefits of technical personnel who maintain our cable network and provide customer support, outside labor costs, vehicle, utilities and pole rental expenses. Plant and operating costs were impacted by an increase in headcount, annual salary increases and increased overtime levels, an increase in technical costs, and an increase in contract labor, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with Operation Reliant, an initiative to replace our use of the third-party provider with our own internal platform and resources which was completed in 2014. 96 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $39,166, $889,960 and $546,386 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for our call centers, customer service and support and administrative personnel; bad debt and collection expenses; billing; advertising; facilities costs; non-cash stock compensation expenses and other non-recurring expenses. General and administrative expenses for the 2015 Predecessor period included $287,691 of share-based compensation expenses related to the profits interest plan. The 2015 Successor period included $26,498 of transaction expenses associated with the Cequel Acquisition. In addition, general and administrative expense were impacted by salary and commission and benefit expense increases, increases in consulting fees resulting from subscriber growth related initiatives and an increase in bad debt expense, offset in part by a decrease in advertising expense. Marketing and sales expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits for our sales force and costs for marketing and promotional materials. Marketing and sales expenses for the 2015 periods were impacted by an increase in direct mail advertising and e-marketing costs, as well as increases in salary and commission expense increases for our door to door sales force. Corporate overhead and management fees primarily consist of wages and benefits for our corporate personnel, legal fees, accounting and audit fees and other corporate expenses, and transaction and acquisition due diligence expenses. Corporate overhead and management fees for the 2015 Predecessor periods were impacted by $67,817 of costs related to the Cequel Acquisition, as well as increases in compensation and public relations expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) amounted to $23,574 and $533,357 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $598,736 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) for the 2015 Successor period includes depreciation and amortization related to the step-up in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cequel Acquisition. The decrease in depreciation and amortization for the 2015 Predecessor period as compared to 2014 was primarily as a result of decreased amortization expenses for customer relationships, as well as a decrease in depreciation resulting from assets being fully depreciated. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $33,689 and $940,609 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $901,548 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 was impacted by an increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, restructuring expense and other expenses and share-based compensation), as discussed above. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net amounted to $11,491 and $237,319 for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, compared to $230,146 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest expense for the Successor 2015 period includes additional interest related to the indebtedness issued to fund the Cequel Acquisition. The interest expense for the 2015 Predecessor period as compared to the 2014 Predecessor period increased 97 Table of Contents primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding and an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts. Income Tax Expense Income tax benefit (expense) amounted to $10,263 and $(29,301) for the period December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, reflecting an effective tax rate of 37% and (16)%, respectively. Income tax expense amounted to $8,095 for the year ended December 31, 2014, reflecting an effective tax rate of 32%. Excluding the impact of non-cash equity compensation expense of $11,556 and the income tax benefit to eliminate the Company's uncertain tax position of $12,984, the effective rate would have been 38%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Altice USA has no operations independent of its subsidiaries, Cablevision and Cequel, which are funded separately. Funding for our subsidiaries has generally been provided by cash flow from their respective operations, cash on hand and borrowings under their revolving credit facilities and the proceeds from the issuance of securities and borrowings under syndicated term loans in the capital markets. Our decision as to the use of cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facilities or accessing the capital markets has been based upon an ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, the timing of cash flow generation and the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit facilities, debt securities and syndicated term loans. We expect to utilize free cash flow and availability under the revolving credit facilities, as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of, or reduce the principal on, our debt obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to, among other factors, market conditions. Additionally, we may, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from other borrowings to repay the outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers, or redemption provisions. 98 Table of Contents We believe existing cash balances, operating cash flows and availability under our revolving credit facilities will provide adequate funds to support our current operating plan, make planned capital expenditures and fulfill our debt service requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our operations, make planned capital expenditures, make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and repay our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows and our ability to access the capital markets, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our collateralized debt maturing in the next 12 months will be settled either by delivering shares of Comcast common stock or by delivering cash from the net proceeds of new monetization transactions. However, competition, market disruptions or a deterioration in economic conditions could lead to lower demand for our products, as well as lower levels of advertising, and increased incidence of customers' inability to pay for the services we provide. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Although we currently believe that amounts available under the revolving credit facilities will be available when, and if needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets or other conditions. The obligations of the financial institutions under the revolving credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. In the longer term, we do not expect to be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet all existing future contractual payment obligations and repay our debt at maturity. As a result, we will be dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets. We will need to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations, and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to do so, we will need to take other actions including deferring capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing or eliminating discretionary uses of cash.

Future fees payable under contracts with programming vendors are based on numerous factors, including the number of subscribers receiving the programming. Amounts reflected above related to programming agreements are based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming as of December 31, 2016 multiplied by the per subscriber rates or the stated annual fee, as applicable, contained in the executed agreements in effect as of December 31, 2016. See Note 2 to the Altice USA, Inc. consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our program rights obligations. (b) Operating lease obligations represent primarily future minimum payment commitments on various long-term, noncancelable leases, at rates now in force, for office, production and storage space, 106 Table of Contents and rental space on utility poles. See Note 7 to the Altice USA, Inc. consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our operating leases. (c) Includes franchise and performance surety bonds primarily for our cable television systems. Also includes outstanding guarantees primarily by CSC Holdings in favor of certain financial institutions in respect of ongoing interest expense obligations in connection with the monetization of our holdings of shares of Comcast common stock. Payments due by period for these arrangements represent the year in which the commitment expires. (d) Consists primarily of letters of credit obtained by CSC Holdings in favor of insurance providers and certain governmental authorities. Payments due by period for these arrangements represent the year in which the commitment expires. (e) Includes interest and principal payments due on our (i) credit facility debt, (ii) senior guaranteed notes, senior secured notes and senior notes and debentures, (iii) notes payable and (iv) collateralized indebtedness. See Notes 9 and 10 to the Altice USA, Inc. consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long-term debt. (f) Reflects the principal amount of capital lease obligations, including related interest. (g) Represents tax liabilities, including accrued interest, relating to uncertain tax positions. See Note 12 to the Altice USA, Inc. consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our income taxes. The table above does not include obligations for payments required to be made under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the amount of franchise fees and certain other taxes and fees included as a component of revenue aggregated $154,732. Other Events Dividends and Distributions Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cablevision was not permitted to declare and pay dividends or repurchase stock, in each case, without the prior written consent of Altice N.V. In accordance with these terms, Cablevision did not declare dividends during the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 (Predecessor). In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company declared distributions aggregating $445,176 to the Company's stockholders of which $365,559 was paid in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $79,617 was paid in the first quarter of 2017. These distributions were used to redeem certain debt outstanding at the parent entities. In April 2017, the Company made a cash distribution of $169,950 to the Company's stockholders. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Equity Price Risk We are exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the shares of Comcast common stock we hold. We have entered into equity derivative contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The contracts' actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed. The contracts' actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract, among other factors. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we 107 Table of Contents would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of December 31, 2016, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. All of our monetization transactions are obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, CSC Holdings provides guarantees of the subsidiaries' ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar. All of our equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair value in our consolidated balance sheets with changes in value reflected in our consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its principal value, net of the unamortized fair value adjustment. The fair value adjustment is being amortized over the term of the related indebtedness. The carrying value of our collateralized indebtedness amounted to $1,286,069 at December 31, 2016. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Comcast common stock, with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $1,483,030. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $148,303. As of December 31, 2016, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the equity derivative contracts entered into to partially hedge the equity price risk of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $2,202, a net liability position. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $53,696 related to our outstanding equity derivative contracts and recorded an unrealized gain of $141,538 related to the Comcast common stock that we held. Fair Value of Equity Derivative Contracts Fair value as of June 21, 2016, net asset position (Cablevision Acquisition) $ 51,494 Change in fair value, net (53,696 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair value as of December 31, 2016, net liability position $ (2,202 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The maturity, number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity, hedge price per share, and the lowest and highest cap prices received for the Comcast common stock monetized via an equity derivative prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table: Cap Price(c) Hedge Price per Share(b) # of Shares Deliverable(a) Maturity Low High 26,815,368(d) 2017 $27.98 - $29.56 $ 35.42 $ 38.43 16,139,868 2018 $30.84 - $33.61 $ 37.01 $ 40.33 (a) Share amounts have been adjusted for the 2 for 1 stock split in February 2017. (b) Represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation. Also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts. (c) Represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation. (d) Includes an equity derivative contract relating to 5,337,750 shares that matured and was settled in January 2017 from proceeds of a new monetization contract covering an equivalent number of shares. 108 Table of Contents Fair Value of Debt : At December 31, 2016, the fair value of our fixed rate debt of $22,405,790 was higher than its carrying value of $20,557,120 by $1,848,670. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. Our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current LIBOR-based market rates and thus their principal values approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2016 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by $1,963,908 to $24,369,698. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is primarily a result of exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads. Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interest rate risk exists primarily with respect to our credit facility debt, which bears interest at variable rates. The carrying value of our outstanding credit facility debt at December 31, 2016 amounted to $3,444,790. To manage interest rate risk, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and/or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. All such contracts are carried at their fair market values on our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. In June 2016, Altice US Finance I Corporation entered into two new fixed to floating interest rate swaps. One fixed to floating interest rate swap is converting $750,000 from a fixed rate of 1.6655% to six-month LIBOR and a second tranche of $750,000 from a fixed rate of 1.68% to six-month LIBOR. The objective of these swaps is to cover the exposure of the 2026 Senior Secured Notes to changes in the market interest rate. These swap contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap contracts are recorded through the statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a loss on interest rate swap contracts of $72,961. As of December 31, 2016, our outstanding interest rate swap contracts had an aggregate fair value and carrying value of $78,823 reflected in "liabilities under derivative contracts" in our consolidated balance sheet. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following: Business Combinations The Company applied business combination accounting for the Cablevision Acquisition and the Cequel Acquisition. Business combination accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities 109 Table of Contents assumed be recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In determining estimated fair values, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, useful lives of identified intangible assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization, impairment charges in certain instances if the asset becomes impaired, and income tax expense or benefit that we report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. See Note 3 for a summary of the application of business combination accounting. Impairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets The Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets at December 31, 2016 include goodwill of $7,992,700, other intangible assets of $19,372,725 ($13,020,081 of which are indefinite-lived intangible assets), and $6,597,635 of property, plant and equipment. Such assets accounted for approximately 93% of the Company's consolidated total assets. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily represent the Company's cable television franchises are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter ("annual impairment test date") and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The Company is operated as two reporting units for the goodwill impairment test and two units of accounting for the indefinite-lived asset impairment test. We assess qualitative factors and other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of the reporting unit and its identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as:  macroeconomic conditions;  industry and market conditions;  cost factors;  overall financial performance;  changes in management, strategy or customers;  relevant specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit or unit of accounting; and  sustained decrease in share price, as applicable. The Company assesses these qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. This quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. When the qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, the Company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill utilizing an enterprise-value based premise approach. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to 110 Table of Contents that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. The Company assesses the qualitative factors discussed above to determine whether it is necessary to perform the one-step quantitative identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test. This quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a unit of accounting's fair value is less than its carrying amount. When the qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, the impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. At December 31, 2016 the Company had indefinite-lived cable television franchises of $13,020,081 ($8,113,575 at Cablevision and $4,906,506 at Cequel), reflecting agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area and allow us to solicit and service potential customers in the service areas defined by the franchise rights currently held by the Company. For other long-lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized such as customer relationships and trade names, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value. In assessing the recoverability of the Company's goodwill and other long-lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. These valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer, number of homes passed, operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of homes passed, among other assumptions. Further, the projected cash flow assumptions consider contractual relationships, customer attrition, eventual development of new technologies and market competition. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to its long-lived assets. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company assessed the qualitative factors described above to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying amount. The Company also assessed these qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the one-step quantitative identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the unit of accounting's fair value was less than its carrying amount. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Company's future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards ("NOLs"). In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax 111 Table of Contents planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. Pursuant to the Cablevision Acquisition and Cequel Acquisition, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that the Company will realize all of its gross deferred tax, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state NOLs. The Company increased the valuation allowance by $86 for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and increased the valuation allowance by $297 for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016. During 2016, certain state NOLs either expired or could not be utilized in the future. The deferred tax asset corresponding to the expired NOLs had been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $3,368 in 2016. Plant and Equipment Costs incurred in the construction of the Company's cable systems, including line extensions to, and upgrade of, the Company's HFC infrastructure, initial placement of the feeder cable to connect a customer that had not been previously connected, and headend facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, subcontractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of the Company's employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. These costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the plant (10 to 25 years) and headend facilities (4 to 25 years). Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with the initial deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide broadband, pay television and telephony services are also capitalized. These costs include materials, subcontractor labor, internal labor, and other related costs associated with the connection activities. The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity. These installation costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the CPE necessary to provide broadband, pay television and telephony services. In circumstances where CPE tracking is not available, the Company estimates the amount of capitalized installation costs based on whether or not the business or residence had been previously connected to the network. These installation costs are depreciated over their estimated useful life of 4-8 years. The portion of departmental costs related to disconnecting services and removing CPE from a customer, costs related to connecting CPE that has been previously connected to the network and repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant and such lives are revised to the extent necessary due to changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies. 112 Table of Contents Legal Contingencies The Company is party to various lawsuits and proceedings and is subject to other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, some involving claims for substantial damages. The Company records an estimated liability for these claims when management believes the loss from such matters is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company reassesses the risk of loss as new information becomes available and adjusts liabilities as necessary. The actual cost of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of the liability recorded. Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our legal contingencies. Equity Awards Certain employees of the Company and its affiliates received awards of units in a carried unit plan of an entity which has an ownership interest in the Company. The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for carried units based on the fair value of the award at grant date. In addition the carried units are presented as temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. An option pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of carried units which requires subjective assumptions for which changes in these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the carried units outstanding. Significant assumptions include equity volatility, risk free rate, time to liquidity event, and discount for lack of marketability. The weighted average grant date fair value of the outstanding units is $0.37 per share and the fair value was $1.76 per share as of December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized an expense of $14,368 related to the push down of share-based compensation related to the carried unit plan and the redeemable equity on our balance sheet at December 31, 2016 was $68,147. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our carried unit plan awards. Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-04, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350). ASU No. 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.

These companies also provide additional services to their B2B customers, including value-added managed services for SMBs and wholesale data access and transport for larger enterprise customers. Key Industry Trends Demand for Broadband Increasing usage of bandwidth-intensive devices and applications such as HD television, online video streaming, content downloading for time-shifted video consumption and content delivered OTT has been driving demand for high-speed broadband Internet. As a result, broadband communications and video services providers have been focusing on providing greater speeds, network capacity and network reliability to their customers in order to capture the revenue opportunity associated with providing high-speed broadband access. This is driving greater investments in next-generation network technologies such as FTTH and DOCSIS 3.1. The rapid adoption of smartphones, Wi-Fi enabled laptops and other connected devices is driving demand for fixed wireless broadband. In order to facilitate access to video and data content for their customers, broadband communications and video services providers are also deploying Wi-Fi hotspots across their network footprint, enabling these operators to leverage their wireline footprint to provide fixed wireless broadband access to subscribers. Mobile network operators are currently planning on deploying next-generation "5G" wireless networks that will enable their subscribers to download data at speeds close to 1 Gbps and potentially create a broadband competitor to fixed wireline networks. However, these 5G networks are expected to require a fixed wireline infrastructure that can effectively backhaul data as well as offload a substantial amount of data that currently goes over mobile networks. This provides broadband communications and video services providers the opportunity to use their wireline and fiber networks to offer backhaul and data offloading for mobile operators. Given this "fixed-mobile" convergence, a FTTH network may enable a broadband communications and video services provider to support a 5G wireless network. The continuously growing demand for broadband access, importance of Wi-Fi hotspots and expected need for a fiber footprint for 5G network deployments all highlight the benefits of a FTTH network to broadband communications and video services providers seeking to capitalize on these trends. Programming Cost Increases and Greater Quality and Availability of Content In recent years, the cost of programming in the cable and satellite video sectors has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. This is due to a variety of factors including annual increases imposed by programmers and stations and additional programming being provided to customers, including HD, digital, and VOD programming. Additionally, this has coincided with a significant increase in the quality of programming from high production value original cable series to enhanced camera and statistical data technology in sports broadcasts. Customers also have access to significantly more and increasingly diverse content through the various packages and bundles, some of which are offered through digital Internet-based delivery platforms (e.g., OTT) and/or directly from content owners, such as HBO, CBS and Nickelodeon. The proliferation of content available from new sources through connected devices and the changing consumption patterns of consumers has had a number of effects, such as causing some users to move into smaller bundles (even in some cases away from pay 114 Table of Contents television to "data-only" plans) and creating additional opportunities for broadband communications and video services providers to sell these new products. Pay television is a lower margin business than broadband due to the high cost of programming, the need for set-top boxes, higher installation costs relative to other services and the disproportionately high contribution of pay television to total customer service calls. These effects can be mitigated if a subscriber moves to a data-only plan at a higher-priced broadband tier in order to accommodate the shift to more Internet-based consumption of video. As a result, broadband communications and video services providers have been focusing on broadband customers and have started to sell such subscribers more Internet-based video services. This has resulted in recent increases in data subscribers even as pay television subscriptions have been declining. Move Towards IP-Based Delivery of Content Due to the rapidly increasing adoption of mobile, tablet, and PC devices for content consumption by subscribers, broadband communications and video services providers are looking to make video content available for consumption across such connected devices. This distribution model, called "TV Everywhere," necessitates an IP-based delivery of video. The move towards IP-based delivery of video has also been driven by the emergence of OTT platforms that leverage IP-based delivery of content to customers. Availability of video content across any mobile, tablet, and PC device highlights the importance of a widespread Wi-Fi network that will allow customers to efficiently access data-intensive video content from multiple locations. IP-based content delivery is allowing broadband communications and video services providers to innovate and provide intuitive, easy-to-access user interfaces as well as more advanced customer-premise equipment. Consolidation in the Cable Sector Cable networks have a high cost of deployment, making it necessary to achieve economies of scale to create lower costs per customer and increase operating margins. Given this cost structure evolution and the similarly capital intensive nature of broadband networks, scale is also important for broadband communications providers. As a result, there has been significant consolidation among broadband communications providers with more than 15 transactions within the past ten years. As of December 31, 2016, the top four broadband communications providers had a greater than 85% market share in the United States across pay television, broadband and telephony services. U.S. MVPDs segment market shares Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, 2016 115 Table of Contents Trends Across Key Product Segments Broadband Broadband has become one of the fastest growing products in communications services, driven by increasing demand from residential customers for faster Internet access and for bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming, content downloading for time-shifted video consumption and other applications delivered over OTT platforms such as Amazon, Hulu, Netflix and YouTube. The U.S. residential broadband market had an estimated total size of $35 billion as of May 2016, with an estimated penetration of 76% of total U.S. households as of the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect this growing broadband adoption and the migration of customers to higher-priced, higher-speed tiers to continue. Residential wireline broadband penetration of U.S. households units Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, 2016 Demand for broadband by B2B customers is growing rapidly as well, due to secular trends such as cloud computing, e-commerce, the increasing importance of "Big Data" and the "Internet of Things". The U.S. commercial broadband market has an estimated total size of $8 billion and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 7.3% from 2016 to 2026, faster than the projected growth rate for residential broadband Internet, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.9% from 2016 to 2026. The primary broadband Internet access technologies are FTTH, HFC and DSL, with HFC being the leading platform representing approximately 63% of the market as of November 2016. We believe increasing demand for higher-speed broadband Internet to support advanced applications requiring higher bandwidth and greater download speeds offers a sizable growth opportunity for cable and fiber-based technologies in the near term. U.S. broadband subscribers by technology and service provider (Share of total subscribers) Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, 2016 116 Table of Contents The strong growth in cable broadband subscribers has largely been at the expense of the DSL sector, which has lost subscribers to cable as the subscribers seek faster download speeds. Broadband communications and video services providers are now upgrading to the new DOCSIS 3.1 standard, enabling higher spectral efficiency and supporting up to 10 Gbps download and 1 Gbps upload speeds.

The speeds actually provided by DSL are, for most users, lower than the headline maximum speed possible due to the distance between the end users' premises and DSL hubs. Most DSL-based operators will likely need to make substantial investments in fiber technologies to be able to support future demand. Given the continued growth in data consumption and increases in broadband penetration, we believe owning a FTTH network will be a strategic differentiator for broadband communications and video services providers since FTTH is capable of cost-efficiently scaling to support data demand over the longer term. While FTTH commonly supports speeds of between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps it is capable of supporting more than 10 Gbps. FTTH is currently primarily offered by Verizon as part of its FiOS offering and AT&T through its U-Verse offering. For SMB customers, providers typically offer broadband as well as Ethernet, data transport and IP-based virtual private networks. For larger enterprise customers, these companies typically offer higher capacity data services, including wide area networking and dedicated data access, and advanced services such as wireless mesh networks. Broadband communications and video services providers also offer wholesale transport services to mobile network operators for cell tower backhaul and to communications companies to connect to customers that their own networks do not reach. Pay Television Cable is the leading platform to distribute pay television in the United States, serving 77% of total U.S. households as of December 31, 2016. Competing technologies and delivery systems include DBS operators, video delivered by communications companies and video delivered directly over the Internet. We believe cable has certain advantages over these technologies, notably in terms of availability of interactive features, image quality and number of channels. 117 Table of Contents Residential multi-channel penetration of U.S. occupied household units Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, 2016 2016 U.S. pay television by technology and provider ( Share of total pay television subscribers ) Source: Management's estimates Services provided via cable networks are characterized by easy-to-use technology, efficient installation of customer equipment and the reliability of a protected signal delivered directly to the home. Given the trend towards offering bundled pay television, broadband and telephony services, broadband communications and video services providers' market share is expected to benefit from their ability to deliver high-bandwidth, triple-play services. DBS operators distribute digital signals nationally via satellite directly to television viewers. To receive programming distributed via satellite, viewers require a satellite dish, a satellite receiver and a set-top box. Satellite distribution has several competitive advantages over cable television services in certain geographic areas, particularly in rural areas. However, given the lack of an integrated return path, DBS operators have struggled to deliver easy-to-handle interactive television services, including VOD services, to subscribers who do not have a broadband Internet connection. Video services delivered over DSL networks present a number of disadvantages compared to cable. In particular, adding television services over a DSL network strains the network and decreases the amount of capacity available for other service offerings, particularly bandwidth-intensive broadband Internet. Given currently available technology, we believe DSL-based triple-play providers will have difficulty providing the same level of services that can be provided over HFC or fiber networks (in particular, for HDTV, viewing of television and VOD on multiple screens, television and VOD simultaneous viewing and recording). 118 Table of Contents Telephony Services Traditional switched voice lines have been declining steadily in recent years as they are replaced by VoIP lines. This trend has been more pronounced for communications companies while cable operators have been able to maintain their subscriber base by bundling the fixed-line service into bundled service packages.

B2B Trends in Other Services Value-added, managed services provided by broadband communications and video services providers to B2B customers include business e-mail, hosted private branch exchange, web space storage, network security monitoring, managed Wi-Fi, managed desktop and server backup and managed collaboration services including audio and web conferencing. With deployments of DOCSIS 3.1 and Passive Optical Networks, broadband communications and video services providers are able to deliver broadband services at speeds of up to 1 Gbps to virtually any business or multi-tenant office building and up to 100 Gbps with service level agreements for enterprise class customers. Such capabilities create opportunities in virtually the entire U.S. managed services market for broadband communications and video services providers. Over the last few years, broadband communications and video services providers have successfully taken market share in the SMB segment from communications companies and are now looking to compete for larger enterprise customers by providing a portfolio of services that include broadband, Ethernet, telephony, network security, business continuity and Wi-Fi. 119 Table of Contents BUSINESS Overview Altice USA is one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers in the United States. We deliver broadband, pay television, telephony services, Wi-Fi hotspot access, proprietary content and advertising services to approximately 4.9 million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich broadband network with more than 8.5 million homes passed as of December 31, 2016. As the U.S. business of Altice N.V., we are driven at all levels by the "Altice Way"our founder-inspired owner-operator culture and strategy of operational efficiency, innovation and long-term value creation for stockholders. In developing and implementing our strategy, we are focused on the following principles, which are part of the Altice Way:  Simplify and optimize our organization through streamlining business processes, centralizing functions and eliminating non-essential operating expenses and service arrangements.  Reinvest in infrastructure and content , including upgrading our HFC network and building out a FTTH network to strengthen our infrastructure capabilities and competitiveness.  Invest in sales, marketing and innovation , including brand-building, enhancing our sales channels and automating provisioning and installation processes.  Enhance the customer experience by offering a technologically advanced customer platform combined with superior connectivity and service across the customer lifecycle.  Drive revenue and cash flow growth through cross-selling, market share gains, new product launches and improvements in our operating and capital efficiency. We believe the Altice Way, which has been successfully implemented across Altice Group, distinguishes us from our U.S. industry peers and competitors. We acquired Cequel Corporation ("Suddenlink" or "Cequel") on December 21, 2015 and Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Optimum" or "Cablevision") on June 21, 2016. These acquisitions are referred to throughout this prospectus as the "Suddenlink Acquisition" (or the "Cequel Acquisition") and the "Optimum Acquisition (or the "Cablevision Acquisition"), respectively, and collectively as the "Acquisitions." We serve our customers through two business segments: Optimum, which operates in the New York metropolitan area, and Suddenlink, which principally operates in markets in the south-central United States. We have made significant progress in integrating the operations of Optimum and Suddenlink and are already realizing the operational and commercial benefits of common ownership and one management team as we implement the Altice Way throughout our organization. We are a majority-owned and controlled U.S. subsidiary of Altice N.V., the multinational cable, fiber, telecommunications, content, media and advertising company founded and controlled by communications and media entrepreneur Patrick Drahi. Our management team benefits from Altice Group's experience in implementing the Altice Way around the world. Mr. Drahi, who has over 25 years of experience owning and managing communications and media operations, has built Altice Group from a regional French cable company founded in 2002 into one of the world's leading broadband communications and video services companies. Over the past 15 years, he has led a transformation of the broadband communications and video services industry through investment in networks and improvements in customer experience and operations to enhance both service delivery and operational efficiency. As of December 31, 2016, Altice Group delivered broadband, pay television and telephony services to more than 50 million customers in Western Europe, the United States, Israel and the Caribbean and reported pro forma consolidated revenue of €23.5 billion and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of €8.9 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Upon the completion of 120 Table of Contents this offering, Altice N.V. and an entity controlled by Patrick Drahi will own % of our outstanding shares in the form of Class B common stock, which will represent % of the voting power of our issued and outstanding common stock. In early 2015, Altice N.V. made the strategic decision to invest in operations in the United States, the country with the largest broadband communications and video services market in the world. Altice N.V. believed that by employing the Altice Way, it could significantly improve upon the historical growth rates, profitability and operational efficiency of broadband communications and video services companies operating in this market. The following attractive market characteristics underpinned Altice N.V.'s U.S. investment thesis:  favorable demographics supporting underlying market growth;  demand for higher-speed broadband services;  demand for more advanced customer platforms and user interfaces;  opportunities to enhance operational efficiency and reduce overhead; and  opportunities for further industry consolidation. Following the Acquisitions, we began employing the Altice Way to simplify our organizational structure, reduce management layers, streamline decision-making processes and redeploy resources with a focus on network investment, customer service enhancements and marketing support. As a result, we have made significant progress in integrating the operations of Optimum and Suddenlink, centralizing our business functions, reorganizing our procurement processes, eliminating duplicative management functions, terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and third-party service arrangements, and investing in our employee relations and our culture. Improved operational efficiency has allowed us to redeploy physical, technical and financial resources towards upgrading our network and enhancing the customer experience to drive customer growth. This focus is demonstrated by reduced network outages since the Acquisitions, which we believe improves the consistency and quality of the customer experience. In addition, we have expanded, and intend to continue expanding, our e-commerce channels for sales and marketing. Since the Acquisitions, we have also upgraded our networks to nearly triple the maximum available broadband speeds we are offering to our Optimum customers and expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 60% of our Suddenlink footprint, compared to approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. In addition, we have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We believe this FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements, fewer service outages and lower power usage, which we expect will drive further cost efficiencies in our business. In order to further enhance the customer experience, we plan to introduce a new home communications hub during the second quarter of 2017. Our new home communications hub will be an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet router and cable modem in one device, and will be the most advanced home communications hub offered by any Altice Group business. We are also beginning to offer managed data and communications services to our business customers and more advanced advertising services, such as targeted multi-screen advertising and data analytics, to our advertising and other business clients. Many of our initiatives have already resulted in a positive impact to our customer relationships, which grew by % from March 31, 2016 (on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Optimum Acquisition) to March 31, 2017. 121 Table of Contents Our Competitive Strengths We believe the following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us for future growth and strong financial performance. Our Owner-Operator Culture We are part of a founder-controlled organization with an owner-operator culture and strategy that is focused on operational efficiency, innovation and long-term value creation for stockholders. This focus is reinforced by a system that delivers a substantial portion of management compensation in the form of long-term equity awards. Since the Acquisitions, our management team has moved quickly to, among other things, simplify and redesign our product offerings, drive adoption of higher broadband speeds and begin building a new FTTH network. We continuously challenge ourselves to improve our operational and financial performance. We encourage communication across the organization while empowering nimble, efficient decision-making that is focused at every level on enhancing the overall customer experience. We believe our owner-operator culture and the Altice Way differentiate us and position us to outperform our U.S. industry peers. We further believe the benefits of the Altice Way have been demonstrated by Altice N.V.'s performance, which is reflected in the 42% average annual total return of Altice N.V.'s Class A ordinary shares since its initial public offering in January 2014 through March 31, 2017, compared to the 5% average annual total return of the STOXX Europe 600 Telecommunications Index, of which Altice N.V.'s Class A ordinary shares is a component, during the same time period. Leading Position in Attractive Markets The markets served by our broadband networks have generally experienced higher levels of disposable income and household density compared to other broadband communications and video services markets in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 75% of the homes passed by our network were in either the New York metropolitan area or Texas. The following table provides a comparison of management's estimate of income and density metrics for our markets to both our largest U.S. publicly-traded industry peers as well as the national averages. Altice USA Charter Communications Comcast Cable One U.S. National Median 2016 Household Median Income (in thousands) $ 86 $ 63 $ 72 $ 59 $ 66 Housing Units per Square Mile as of April 1, 2010 based on most recent U.S. census data 668 99 119 24 37 The footprint of our Optimum network includes New York City, the world's largest media and entertainment market as measured by 2014 revenue. This network represents our largest cluster of cable and fiber network systems. As of December 31, 2016, this network passed approximately 5.1 million homes and provided broadband, pay television and telephony services to approximately 3.1 million unique residential and business customers, representing approximately 64% of our entire customer base. We believe our leading market demographics support revenue growth potential in terms of customer additions and increased ARPU. We believe the market density of the New York metropolitan area allows our Optimum segment to operate with greater capital efficiency and lower capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue than our U.S. industry peers. Our presence in this market and its high-profile customer base also gives us access to a large and valuable base of advertisers, advertising inventory and advertising data, each of which supports growth prospects for our advertising business. 122 Table of Contents The footprint of our Suddenlink network includes markets in Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona, California, Missouri and eight other states. As of December 31, 2016, this network passed approximately 3.4 million homes and provided broadband, pay television and telephony services to approximately 1.8 million unique residential and business customers, representing approximately 36% of our customer base. We believe less than 15% of our Suddenlink footprint currently faces competition from broadband communications and video services providers offering download speeds comparable to our fastest offered speeds. In addition, household penetration of residential broadband connections with speeds of at least 25 Mbps in these markets was less than 34% in 2015 compared to approximately 44% nationwide, as estimated by management, providing us with attractive future growth opportunities. As a result, we believe Suddenlink's markets are among the most attractive broadband communications and video services markets in the United States. Advanced Network and Customer Platform Technologies Technological innovation and network investments are key components of the Altice Way. Substantially all of our HFC network is digital video and DOCSIS 3.0 compatible, with approximately 300 homes per node and a bandwidth capacity of at least 750 MHz throughout. This network allows us to provide our customers with advanced broadband, pay television and telephony services. In addition, we believe our Optimum footprint offers the densest Wi-Fi network among our U.S. industry peers as measured by the number of Wi-Fi hotspots per broadband subscriber. Since the Acquisitions, we have nearly tripled the maximum available broadband speeds we are offering to our Optimum customers from 101 Mbps to 300 Mbps for residential customers and 350 Mbps for business customers and have expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 60% of our Suddenlink footprint from approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. Our advanced network has contributed to our revenue growth by allowing us to meet market demand for increasingly faster speeds. The chart below illustrates the significant increase in the percentage of our new residential customers choosing service plans with speeds greater than or equal to 100 Mbps since the Acquisitions. To position us to satisfy anticipated market demand for increasing speeds and support evolving technologies, such as the expected transition of mobile networks to 5G, and to enable us to capture associated revenue growth opportunities, we have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH 123 Table of Contents network that will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We also plan to introduce a new home communications hub during the second quarter of 2017, which will be the most advanced home communications hub offered by any Altice Group business. This new hub will be an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet router and cable modem in one device. It is based on LaBox, a home communications hub Altice Group has successfully deployed in France, the Dominican Republic and Israel, and will be initially offered to customers subscribing to our triple product packages. It will be capable of delivering broadband, Wi-Fi, pay television services, OTT services and fixed-line telephony and will support 4K video and a remote DVR. We intend to continue enhancing the features and functionality of our new home communications hub after its initial introduction. We believe the development of our advanced network and new home communications hub epitomizes the engineering and innovation-centric ethos within Altice Group. Customer-Centric Operating and Service Model Supported by Technology and Data Analytics We seek to provide our customers with the best connectivity and service experience available. This customer-centric approach drives our decision-making processes and is another key component of the Altice Way. Through investments in our information technology ("IT") platforms and a focus on process improvement, we have simplified and harmonized our service offering bundles, and improved our technical service delivery and our customer service. We are investing in our sales channels, including enhancing our e-commerce channels in response to customer behavior. While inbound sales remain the largest sales channel for each of Optimum and Suddenlink, our e-commerce channels' share of new sales has grown substantially since the Acquisitions. We develop, monitor and analyze detailed customer metrics to identify root-causes of customer dissatisfaction and to further improve the customer experience. Taken together, we believe these initiatives will further reduce calls and service visits, increase customer satisfaction and strengthen our top-line performance and cash flow generation. Benefits of a Global Communications Group Unlike most of our U.S. industry peers, we benefit from being part of an international media and communications group. As the U.S. business of Altice N.V., we have access to the innovation, management expertise and best practices developed and tested in other Altice Group markets such as France, Portugal, the Dominican Republic and Israel. For example, our new home communications hub will be based on LaBox, which was developed by Altice Labs, Altice N.V.'s technology, services and operations innovation center, and our FTTH network build-out will leverage Altice Labs' technology and expertise developed for the deployment of GPON technology in Altice Group's fiber networks. Our B2B service offerings draw from platforms, services and expertise developed by sophisticated B2B operators across the Altice Group footprint such as Portugal Telecom in Portugal and SFR in France. We also benefit from Altice Group's significant scale advantages, allowing us to draw on centralized functions, including procurement and technical services. In addition, Altice Group operates converged networks, including wireless operations in markets outside the United States. We believe these scale benefits and operational expertise assist us in increasing our operating efficiency and reducing our capital expenditures while also improving the customer experience. Altice Group also cross-deploys talent and expertise across its businesses, allowing us to benefit from our senior management's experience in successfully implementing the Altice Way around the world. We believe this diversity of experience differentiates us from our more traditional U.S.-centric industry peers. 124 Table of Contents Strategic Focus on Operational Efficiency An important principle of the Altice Way is leveraging operational efficiency in order to invest in network improvements and increase returns. We believe our focus on simplifying customer service offerings and streamlining and improving our operations through an intense focus on efficiency is unmatched by our U.S. industry peers. We continuously strive to remove unnecessary management layers, streamline decision-making processes, trim excess costs and question whether our current methodologies are indeed the most efficient. For example, the home installation, repair, outside plant maintenance and network construction elements of our business have been reorganized under Altice Technical Services ("ATS"), Altice N.V.'s services organization in the United States. We believe this reorganization will allow us to focus on our core competencies and realize operational cost efficiencies. The financial resources created by these strategies allow us to invest in network improvements and customer experience enhancements. We believe the operating and financial benefits that result from our focus on operational efficiency will continue to give us a competitive advantage against our competitors and U.S. industry peers. Powerful Financial Model Driving Strong Returns We believe the benefits of the Altice Way have already significantly strengthened our financial performance and will continue to do so, allowing us to deliver strong returns. Our revenue growth for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was % as compared to pro forma revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We believe we can continue growing our revenue by increasing market penetration of our services (particularly broadband), driving continued growth in B2B services, launching new services, gaining market share from competitors due to the high quality and value of our services and leveraging improved customer satisfaction to sell additional services. We believe we are one of the most profitable and cash flow generative broadband communications and video services providers in the United States. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin has increased from % for the three months ended March 31, 2016 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Optimum Acquisition to % for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Combined with our revenue growth, this translates into a % year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA growth. See "Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data" for additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income. As of December 31, 2016, we have realized a substantial portion of the total $1.1 billion in operating cost savings we announced that we would achieve over the three-year period following the Acquisitions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue was %, which we believe is one of the lowest among our U.S. industry peers, even as we increased our investments in network and service capabilities. The ratio of our Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures to revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was %, implying that for each dollar of Adjusted EBITDA that we realized in that quarter we generated approximately $ of Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, which we believe exceeds the performance of our U.S. industry peers. We believe our profitability, capital efficiency and cash generation profile, which is among the highest in the industry, results from a number of factors, including our focus on operational efficiency derived from the Altice Way, the advanced state of our HFC network infrastructure, our highly clustered network footprint and our customer base with relatively high ARPU and low churn. Experienced Management Team Supported by Founder Our CEO and Co-Presidents have substantial experience in communications and media operations, finance and mergers and acquisitions, and a proven track record in executing the Altice Way. Dexter Goei, our CEO and Chairman since 2016, joined Altice N.V. in 2009, and as its CEO he spearheaded 125 Table of Contents the rapid expansion of the company from a French cable operator to a multinational communications enterprise with fixed and mobile assets across six different countries. A key aspect of Mr. Goei's role as CEO of Altice USA is to carry forward the same entrepreneurial and owner-operator culture that is at the core of the Altice Way and Altice N.V.'s success. Hakim Boubazine, our Co-President and COO since 2015, was previously the CEO of Altice Group's Dominican Republic business, where he oversaw pay television, broadband and mobile operations for more than four million customers. Charles Stewart, our Co-President and CFO since 2015, previously served as CEO of Itau BBA International plc, where he oversaw Itau-Unibanco's wholesale banking activities in Europe, United States and Asia. Prior to that, he spent nineteen years at Morgan Stanley in a variety of investment banking roles including nine years focused on the U.S. cable industry. Our management team operates in a coordinated fashion with Altice N.V.'s management team and is supported by Altice Group's founder and controlling stockholder, Patrick Drahi. We believe this facilitates a flat corporate structure, speed in decision making and a focus on long-term value creation. Our Business Strategy Our business strategy is based on the successful Altice Way. By executing on the principles described below, we aim to provide advanced, innovative broadband, pay television and telephony services to our customers and deliver strong returns to our stockholders. The Altice Way Simplify and Optimize Our Organization Since the Acquisitions, we have implemented the Altice Way across our organization to streamline processes and service offerings and to improve productivity by centralizing our business functions, reorganizing our procurement processes, eliminating duplicative management functions and overhead, terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and third-party service arrangements, and investing in our employee relations and our culture. This has resulted in a revitalized organization as well as improved financial performance, which we are leveraging to re-invest in our business. We are also reorganizing and simplifying our customer service, programming and data analytics; using ATS to increase quality, efficiency and productivity; and updating and simplifying our IT infrastructure through further investments and integration. Reinvest in Infrastructure and Content Our entire Optimum footprint is upgraded to deliver broadband speeds of up to 300 Mbps for residential customers and up to 350 Mbps for business customers, and we have expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 60% of our Suddenlink footprint, compared to approximately 40% 126 Table of Contents prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. In addition, we have commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We believe we can carry out this network build-out efficiently and within our current capital expenditure levels because of (i) the proximity of fiber to our end customers in our existing network; (ii) our access to Altice Labs' experience and expertise in deploying GPON for its FTTH projects in other markets; (iii) our favorable network topology that is over 75% aerial; and (iv) the lower unit construction costs available to us through ATS. We believe our FTTH investment will further prepare us for the future by enabling us to provide our residential and business customers with technologically advanced services and increased network reliability, while providing us with lower operating costs and opportunities for new revenue sources. For instance, we believe our FTTH investment will offer significant strategic value as the mobile and fixed network environments continue to converge, particularly as mobile operators deploy 5G and subsequent mobile networks. Our reinvestment in content has focused on the news category with ongoing investments in our hyper-local news channel News12, our 25% investment in the U.S. operations of i24 News, the Altice Group global news network that was launched in the United States in February 2017, and our 25% interest in Newsday, a daily newspaper that primarily serves Long Island. In addition, we are evaluating opportunities to deploy other content assets owned by Altice Group. Invest in Sales, Marketing and Innovation We are reinvesting in our sales channels, including enhancing our e-commerce channels such as Optimum.com and Suddenlink.com, and developing e-commerce-only promotions. We are also focused on building our brand to emphasize the quality of our services by developing Optimum Experience retail stores in shopping malls and other high-traffic locations. We seek to innovate across many areas of our business. For our residential customers, this includes our focus on new customer platforms and faster data speeds. For our business customers, we are introducing new value-added managed services while for our advertising clients we offer advanced, targeted and multi-screen advertising services and data analytics using our proprietary data and the advanced technology platforms that we have developed and acquired. Enhance the Customer Experience We intend to deliver a superior customer experience through implementation of the Altice Way. First, we aim to offer the most technologically advanced customer platforms, including our new home communications hub, which is an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface combining a set-top box, Internet router and cable modem in one device. Second, by leveraging our advanced infrastructure (with more than 8.5 million homes passed and approximately 1.8 million Wi-Fi hotspots as of December 31, 2016), we seek to provide our customers with a bandwidth and connectivity experience superior to what our competition offers. We believe our FTTH network build-out will further enhance our infrastructure position, improve service reliability for our customers and lower our maintenance costs. Third, we strive to provide the best service across the customer lifecycle from point of sale to installation and customer care. A key aspect of this initiative is to link internal sales incentives to metrics tied to the length of a new customer relationship and product mix, as opposed to more traditional criteria of new sales, in order to refocus our organization away from churn retention to churn prevention. For example, the number of technical service calls handled by our representatives in March 2017 was 23.8% lower compared to March 2016 while the number of customer service calls handled by our representatives was 17.3% lower over the same period. 127 Table of Contents Drive Revenue and Cash Flow Growth Since the Acquisitions, we have made significant progress in improving our growth in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow and believe we have additional opportunities to drive continued growth in these financial metrics based on the following factors:  continued market demand for our bundled services, particularly broadband driven by increased data consumption and bandwidth requirements;  focus on selling and cross-selling higher value and more enriched service offerings to our residential and business customers, as well as the introduction of new services leveraging our advanced HFC and FTTH networks;  market share gains driven by product innovation and the quality and value of our services;  focus on connectivity, business and advertising services;  improvements in our operating and capital efficiency through continued implementation of the Altice Way; and  opportunities to further improve our capital structure. Opportunistically Grow Through Value-Accretive Acquisitions We intend to opportunistically grow through value-accretive acquisitions. Our controlling stockholder, Altice N.V., has made over 30 acquisitions since its inception in 2002, including the Acquisitions. We believe Altice N.V. has consistently demonstrated an ability to acquire and effectively integrate companies, realize efficiencies and cost synergies, improve revenue trends and grow Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. In the six largest acquisitions completed by Altice N.V., SFR (formerly Numericable), Portugal Telecom, HOT, Orange Dominicana, Optimum and Suddenlink, it has increased Adjusted EBITDA margin on average by percentage points and revenue growth on average by percentage points between the first full fiscal quarter following the completion of each acquisition and the three months ended March 31, 2017. Altice N.V.'s track record of creating value through acquisitions is also reflected in the 32% average annual total return of SFR's ordinary shares since its initial public offering in November 2013 until March 31, 2017, compared to the 5% average annual total return of the STOXX Europe 600 Telecommunications Index, of which SFR's ordinary shares is a component, during the same time period. We believe the U.S. broadband communications and video services market offers a number of attractive opportunities to grow our business through strategic acquisitions. We believe the Altice Way and our related ability to achieve efficiencies and cost synergies following acquisitions provide us with a competitive advantage in such future consolidation opportunities. However, there is no assurance that we would be able to achieve similar results or that any such acquisitions would have a similar impact on our stock price performance. Our Products and Services We provide broadband, pay television and telephony services to both residential and business customers. We also provide enterprise-grade fiber connectivity, bandwidth and managed services to enterprise customers through Optimum's Lightpath business and advertising time to advertisers. The prices we charge for our services vary based on the number of services and associated service level or tier our customers choose, coupled with any promotions we may offer. As part of our marketing strategy our customers are increasingly choosing to bundle their subscriptions to two ("double product") or three ("triple product") of our services at the same time. Customers who subscribe to a bundle generally receive a discount from the price of buying each of these services separately, as well as the convenience of receiving multiple services from a single provider, all on a 128 Table of Contents single monthly bill. For example, we offer an "Optimum Triple Play" package that is a special promotion for new customers or eligible current customers where Optimum broadband, pay television and telephony services are each available at a reduced rate for a specified period when purchased together. Approximately 50% of our residential customers were triple product customers as of the year ended December 31, 2016. Residential Services We offer broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers through both our Optimum and Suddenlink segments. The following tables show our residential customer relationships and revenues by service offerings for each of our Optimum and Suddenlink segments as well as on a combined basis. As of December 31, 2016 As of Pro Forma December 31, 2015 Optimum Suddenlink Total Optimum Suddenlink Total (in thousands) Total residential customer relationships 2,879 1,649 4,528 2,858 1,618 4,476 Pay TV customers 2,428 1,107 3,535 2,487 1,154 3,641 Broadband customers 2,619 1,344 3,963 2,562 1,276 3,838 Telephony customers 1,962 597 2,559 2,007 581 2,588 For the year ended Pro forma December 31, 2016 For the year ended Pro forma December 31, 2015 Optimum Suddenlink Total Optimum Suddenlink Total (dollars in thousands) Residential revenue: Pay TV $ 3,106,697 $ 1,120,525 $ 4,227,222 $ 3,142,991 $ 1,117,640 $ 4,260,631 Broadband 1,455,625 834,414 2,290,039 1,303,918 701,094 2,005,012 Telephony 718,176 153,939 872,115 748,181 163,821 912,002 Broadband Services We offer a variety of broadband service tiers tailored to meet the different needs of our residential subscribers. Current customer offers include four tiers with download speeds ranging from 60 Mbps to 300 Mbps for our Optimum residential customers and 50 Mbps to 1 Gbps for our Suddenlink residential customers. Our broadband services also include access to complimentary features such as our free-to-use Optimum wireless "smart router," as well as Internet security software, including anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewall and anti-spam protection. Substantially all of our HFC network is digital and DOCSIS 3.0 compatible, with approximately 300 homes per node and a bandwidth capacity of at least 750 MHz throughout. This network allows us to provide our customers with advanced broadband, pay television and telephony services. Since the Acquisitions, we have nearly tripled the maximum available broadband speeds we are offering to our Optimum customers from 101 Mbps to 300 Mbps for residential customers and 350 Mbps for business customers and expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 60% of our Suddenlink footprint from approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. We have also commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. See "Our Competitive StrengthsAdvanced Network and Customer Platform Technologies." In addition, we have deployed Wi-Fi across our Optimum service area with approximately 1.8 million Wi-Fi hotspots as of December 31, 2016. The Optimum Wi-Fi network allows Optimum broadband customers to access the service while they are away from their home or office. Wi-Fi is 129 Table of Contents delivered via wireless access points mounted on our Optimum broadband network, in certain retail partner locations, certain NJ Transit rail stations, New York City parks and other public venues. Similarly, our "smart router" product includes a second network that enables all Optimum broadband customers to access the Optimum Wi-Fi network. Access to the Optimum Wi-Fi network is offered as a free value-added benefit to Optimum broadband customers and for a fee to non-customers in certain locations. Our Wi-Fi service also allows our Optimum broadband customers to access the Wi-Fi networks of Comcast, Charter Communications (within the legacy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks footprints) and Cox Communications. Through these relationships we offer our Optimum customers access to approximately 350,000 additional hotspots nationwide. Pay Television Services We currently offer a variety of pay television services, which include delivery of broadcast stations and cable networks, and advanced digital pay television services, such as VOD, HD channels, DVR and pay-per-view, to our residential markets. Depending on the market and level of service, our pay television services include, among other programming, local broadcast networks and independent television stations, news, information, sports and entertainment channels, regional sports networks, international channels and premium services such as HBO, Showtime, Cinemax and Starz. Our residential subscribers pay a monthly charge based on the pay television programming level of service, tier or package they receive and the type of equipment they select. Customers who subscribe to seasonal sports packages, international channels and premium services may be charged an additional monthly amount. We may also charge additional fees for pay-per-view programming, DVR and certain VOD services. As of December 31, 2016, Optimum residential customers were able to receive up to 619 digital channels and Suddenlink residential customers were able to receive up 303 digital channels depending on their market and level of service. Optimum offers up to 171 HD channels and Suddenlink channel lineups include an average of 110 HD channels, which represent the most widely watched programming, including all major broadcast networks, as well as most leading national cable networks, premium channels and regional sports networks. HDTV features high-resolution picture quality, digital sound quality and a wide-screen, theater-like display when using an HDTV set and an HD-capable converter. We also continue to launch additional HD channels to continuously improve our customer's viewing experience. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 95% of our residential Optimum pay television customers subscribe to HDTV services. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 79% of Suddenlink pay television customers were digital pay television customers and approximately 93% of those digital pay television customers subscribe to HDTV services. We also provide advanced services, such as pay-per-view and VOD, that give residential pay television subscribers control over when they watch their favorite programming. Our pay-per-view service allows customers to pay to view single showings of programming on an unedited, commercial-free basis, including feature films, live sporting events, concerts and other special events. Our VOD service provides on-demand access to movies, special events, free prime time content and general interest titles. Subscription-based VOD premium content such as HBO and Showtime is made available to customers who subscribe to one of our premium programming packages. Our customers have the ability to start the programs at whatever time is convenient, as well as pause, rewind and (for most content) fast forward both standard definition and HD VOD programming. As of December 31, 2016, pay-per-view services were available for all Optimum and 99% of Suddenlink pay television customers and VOD services were available to all of our Optimum pay television customers and 95% of our Suddenlink pay television customers, and we offered thousands of HD titles on-demand for Optimum and Suddenlink customers, respectively. For a monthly fee, we offer DVR services through the use of digital converters, the majority of which are HDTV-capable and have video recording capability. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 130 Table of Contents 49% of our residential Optimum pay television customers and 36% of our Suddenlink pay television customers utilized DVR services. Optimum customers can choose either a set-top box DVR with the ability to record, pause and rewind live television or the Multi-Room DVR Plus with remote-storage capability to record 15 shows simultaneously while watching any live or pre-recorded show, and pause and rewind live television. Depending on the market, Suddenlink customers have the option to use a set-top box DVR or a TiVo HD/DVR converter, which delivers multi-room DVR capability using TiVo Mini devices that allow customers to pause and rewind live television, manage recordings from different television locations and play them back throughout the home. In addition, TiVo Stream service, which allows customers to stream live television channels and recorded programming wirelessly throughout their home to Android and iOS devices, and, subject to copyright restrictions, download previously recorded content to these devices so that it can be viewed outside the home, is provided to current TiVo DVR subscribers. We also plan to introduce a new home communications hub during the second quarter of 2017, which will be the most advanced home communications hub offered by any Altice Group business. This new hub will be an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet router and cable modem in one device. It is based on LaBox, which Altice N.V. has successfully deployed in France, the Dominican Republic and Israel, and will be initially offered to customers subscribing to our triple-product packages. It will be capable of delivering broadband Internet, Wi-Fi, digital television services, OTT services and fixed-line telephony and will support 4K video and a remote-storage DVR with the capacity to record 15 television programs simultaneously and the ability to rewind live television on the last two channels watched. Additional features will include multiple storage tiers, a point-anywhere voice-command remote control and a companion mobile app that allows viewing of all television content including DVR streaming. Additional televisions will be paired with "minis," which will also act as Wi-Fi extenders for an advanced Wi-Fi experience throughout the home. Additionally, our new home communications hub and the "minis" will offer simple touch-to-pair capability for select mobile devices via near-field communications technology. We also offer alternative viewing platforms for our pay television programming through mobile applications. Our Optimum customers have access to Optimum App, available for the iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, personal computers, Kindle Fire and select Android phones and tablets, and our Suddenlink customers have access to Suddenlink2GO, available for personal computers and select phones and tablets. Depending on the platform, the Optimum App features include the ability to watch live television, stream on-demand titles from various networks and use the device as a remote to control the customer's digital set-top box while inside the home. Suddenlink2GO enables Suddenlink customers to watch over 400,000 movies, shows and clips from over 380 networks on a personal computer once authenticated via the Suddenlink customer portal and select television shows and movies on their mobile devices. Telephony Services Through VoIP telephone service we also offer unlimited local, regional and long-distance calling within the United States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Canada for a flat monthly rate, including popular calling features such as caller ID with name and number, call waiting, three-way calling, enhanced emergency 911 dialing and television caller ID. We also offer additional options designed to meet our customers' needs, including directory assistance, voicemail services and international calling. Discount and promotional pricing are available when our telephony services are combined with our other service offerings. 131 Table of Contents Business Services Both our Optimum and Suddenlink segments offer a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and pay television services. For the year ended December 31, 2016, business services accounted for approximately 14% of the revenue for both our Optimum and Suddenlink segments, respectively, and on a pro forma basis accounted for approximately 14% of our consolidated revenue. As of the end of that period we served approximately 365,000 SMB customers. We serve enterprise customers primarily through our Lightpath business, a subsidiary of Optimum. Enterprise Customers Lightpath provides Ethernet, data transport, IP-based virtual private networks, Internet access, telephony services, including SIP trunking and VoIP services to the business market. Our Lightpath bandwidth connectivity service offers download speeds up to 100 Gbps. Lightpath also provides managed services to businesses, including hosted telephony services (cloud based SIP-based private branch exchange), managed Wi-Fi, managed desktop and server backup and managed collaboration services including audio and web conferencing. Through Lightpath, we also offer FTTT services to wireless carriers for cell tower backhaul and enable wireline communications service providers to connect to customers that their own networks do not reach. Lightpath's customers include companies in health care, financial, education, legal and professional services, and other industries, as well as the public sector and communication providers (ILECs and CLECs). As of December 31, 2016, Lightpath had over 8,300 locations connected to its fiber network. Our Lightpath advanced fiber optic network extends more than 6,700 route miles, which includes approximately 338,000 miles of fiber, throughout the New York metropolitan area. For enterprise and larger commercial customers, Suddenlink offers high capacity data services, including wide area networking and dedicated data access and advanced services such as wireless mesh networks. Suddenlink also offers enterprise class telephone services which include traditional multi-line phone service over DOCSIS and trunking solutions via SIP for our Primary Rate Interface and SIP trunking applications. Similar to Lightpath, Suddenlink also offers FTTT services. These Suddenlink services are offered on a standalone basis or in bundles that are developed specifically for our commercial customers. SMB Customers Both our Optimum and Suddenlink segments provide broadband, pay television and telephony services to SMB custimers. In addition to these services, we also offer managed services, including business e-mail, hosted private branch exchange, web space storage and network security monitoring for SMB customers. We also offer Optimum Voice for Business, providing for up to 24 voice lines for SMB customers and 20 business calling features at no additional charge. Optimum Voice for Business offers business trunking services with support for application programming interfaces. Optional add-on services, such as international calling, toll free calling and virtual receptionists, are also available for business customers. Advertising Sales As part of the agreements under which we acquire pay television programming, we typically receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time during such programming, generally two minutes per hour, into which our systems can insert commercials, subject, in some instances, to certain subject matter limitations. Our advertising sales infrastructure includes in-house production facilities, production and administrative employees and a locally-based sales force, and is part of Altice Media Solutions ("AMS"), the advertising sales division of Altice USA. 132 Table of Contents AMS offers data-driven television, digital and other multi-platform advertising to clients ranging from Fortune 500 brands to local businesses. AMS provides national and local businesses with television and digital advertising opportunities targeted within specific geographies, including in New York City, the world's largest media and entertainment market as measured by 2014 revenue, and throughout the Suddenlink footprint. AMS offers clients opportunities to use interactive television products to reach their customers and provide a deeper level of audience engagement. In several of the markets in which we operate, we have entered into agreements commonly referred to as interconnects with other cable operators to jointly sell local advertising, simplifying our clients' purchase of local advertising and expanding their geographic reach. In some of these markets, we represent the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators; in other markets, other cable operators represent us. For instance, AMS manages the New York Interconnect, a partnership between AMS and Comcast that provides national brands with television and digital advertising opportunities over a broader portion of the New York DMA than AMS's local offerings. New York Interconnect is the largest interconnect in the country, with a footprint of over 3.2 million households. In the larger DMAs in the Suddenlink footprint, we participate in a number of interconnects managed by others, such as the Houston and Dallas interconnects. For the year ended December 31, 2016, advertising sales accounted for approximately 5% and 3% of the revenue for our Optimum and Suddenlink segments, respectively, and on a pro forma basis accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated revenue. Data Analytics The Advanced Data Analytics business, which was launched by Optimum in 2013, provides data-driven, audience-based advertising solutions to the media industry, including AMS, programmers and MVPDs. Total Audience Data, its flagship portfolio of products, consists of advanced analytics tools providing granular measurement of consumer groups, accurate hyper-local ratings and other insights into target audience behavior not available through traditional sample-based measurement services. These tools allow us and our clients to more precisely optimize our product offerings, target and deliver ads more efficiently, and provide accurate measurement to our clients and partners. Our March 2017 acquisition of Audience Partners, a leading provider of data-driven, audience-based digital advertising solutions, expands the scope of targeted advertising solutions we offer from television to include digital, mobile and tablets. In addition, the acquisition expands our audience-based advertising services to include further advanced analytics tools within key and growing segments, including political, advocacy, healthcare, automotive, and programming. Altice N.V. recently announced an agreement to acquire Teads, a leading online video advertising marketplace, which we believe will further enhance our ability to offer data analytics and advertising solutions to our clients. News 12 Networks News 12 Networks is the largest and one of the most-watched 24-hour local news networks in the New York media market. Owned exclusively by us, the network consists of seven local news channels in the New York metropolitan areathe Bronx, Brooklyn, Connecticut, Hudson Valley, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchesterproviding each with complete access to hyper-local breaking news, traffic, weather, sports, and more. In addition, News 12 Networks also includes five traffic and weather channels that offer constantly updated information; the award-winning News12.com, the premier destination for local news on the web; News 12 Interactive, channel 612 on Optimum TV, providing local news on demand; and News 12 To Go, the network's mobile app for phones and tablets. Since launching in 1986, News 12 Networks has been widely recognized by the news industry with numerous prestigious honors and awards, including over 230 Emmy Awards, plus multiple Edward R. Murrow Awards, NY Press Club Awards, and more. We derive revenue from our News 12 Networks for the sale 133 Table of Contents of advertising and affiliation fees paid by cable operators. Advertising revenue is included in "Advertising" and affiliation fees charged for the programming are included in "Other." Franchises As of December 31, 2016, our systems operated in more than 1,300 communities pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local governmental authorities. Franchise agreements typically require the payment of franchise fees and contain regulatory provisions addressing, among other things, service quality, cable service to schools and other public institutions, insurance and indemnity. Franchise authorities generally charge a franchise fee of not more than 5% of certain of our cable service revenues that are derived from the operation of the system within such locality. We generally pass the franchise fee on to our subscribers. Franchise agreements are usually for a term of five to 15 years from the date of grant and most are 10 years. Franchise agreements are usually terminable only if the cable operator fails to comply with material provisions and then only after the franchising authority complies with substantive and procedural protections afforded by the franchise agreement and federal and state law. Prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises, we generally initiate renewal proceedings with the granting authorities. This process usually takes less than three years but can take a longer period of time. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"), which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communications, provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals. See "RegulationCable TelevisionFranchising." In connection with the franchise renewal process, many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make certain commitments, such as building out certain franchise areas, meeting customer service requirements and supporting and carrying public access channels. Historically, we have been able to renew our franchises without incurring significant costs, although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise. We expect to renew or continue to operate under all or substantially all of these franchises. For more information regarding risks related to our franchises, see "Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to Regulatory and Legislative MattersOur cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business." Proposals to streamline cable franchising recently have been adopted at both the federal and state levels. For more information see "RegulationCable TelevisionFranchising." Programming We design our channel line-ups for each system according to demographics, programming contract requirements, market research, viewership, local programming preferences, channel capacity, competition, price sensitivity and local regulation. We believe offering a wide variety of programming influences a customer's decision to subscribe to and retain our pay television services. We obtain programming, including basic, expanded basic, digital, HD, VOD and broadband content, from a number of suppliers, including broadcast and cable networks. We generally carry cable networks pursuant to written programming contracts, which continue for a fixed period of time, usually from three to five years, and are subject to negotiated renewal. Cable network programming is usually made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers who subscribe to the level of service that provides such programming. Such license fees may include "volume" discounts available for higher numbers of customers, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration. Where possible, we negotiate volume discount pricing structures. For home shopping channels, we receive a percentage of the revenue attributable to our customers' purchases, as well as, in some instances, incentives for channel placement. 134 Table of Contents We typically seek flexible distribution terms that would permit services to be made available in a variety of retail packages and on a variety of platforms and devices in order to maximize consumer choice. Suppliers typically insist that their most popular and attractive services be distributed to a minimum number or percentage of subscribers, which limits our ability to provide consumers full purchasing flexibility. Suppliers also typically seek to control or limit the terms on which we are able to make their services available on various platforms and devices yet this has become more flexible each year. Our cable programming costs have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. We expect programming costs to continue to increase due to a variety of factors including annual increases imposed by stations and programmers and additional programming being provided to customers, including HD, digital and VOD programming. In particular, broadcast and sports programming costs have increased significantly over the past several years. In addition, contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes provide for optional additional programming to be available on a surcharge basis during the term of the contract. These increases have coincided with a significant increase in the quality of the programming, from high production value original cable series to enhanced camera and statistical data technology in sports broadcasts, and more flexible rights to make the content available on various platforms and devices. We have programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2017. We will seek to renegotiate the terms of these agreements, but there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. In our Suddenlink segment, we were unable to reach agreement with Viacom on acceptable economic terms for a long-term contract renewal, and effective October 1, 2014, all Viacom networks were removed from our channel lineups in our Suddenlink segment, and we launched alternative networks offered by other programmers under new long-term contracts. For more information, see "Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to Our BusinessProgramming and retransmission costs are increasing and we may not have the ability to pass these increases on to our subscribers. Disputes with programmers and the inability to retain or obtain popular programming can adversely affect our relationship with subscribers and lead to subscriber losses." Sales and Marketing Sales are managed centrally and multiple sales channels are leveraged to reach current and potential customers, including in-bound customer care centers, outbound telemarketing, stores, field technician sales and door-to-door sales. E-commerce is also managed centrally on behalf of the organization and is a growing and dynamic part of our business and is our fastest growing sales channel. We use mass media, including broadcast television, digital media, radio, newspaper and outdoor advertising, to attract customers and direct them to our in-bound customer care centers or website. Our sales and service employees use a variety of sales tools as they work to match customers' needs with our best-in-class products, with a focus on building and enhancing customer relationships. Because of our local presence and market knowledge, we invest heavily in targeted marketing. Our strategic focus is on building new customer relationships and bundling broadband, pay television and telephony services. Our promotional materials and message focus on the ease with which a customer can order our products and services, and highlight the differentiated connectivity and entertainment experience and the convenience of one call, one connection and one bill. Much of our advertising is developed centrally and customized for our regions. Among other factors, we monitor customer perceptions, marketing efforts and competition, to increase our responsiveness and the effectiveness of our efforts. Our footprint has several large college markets where we market specialized products and services to students for MDUs, such as dormitories and apartment complexes. 135 Table of Contents We have separate dedicated sales teams for our SMB and enterprise offerings and dedicated service teams to support SMB and enterprise clients. Altice Technical Services The reorganization of our technical workforce into ATS, which is owned by Altice N.V. and ATS management, is modeled on Altice N.V.'s successful implementation of a similar strategy in its other operations. In most other markets in which Altice N.V. operates, it separates home installation, repair, outside plant maintenance and network construction elements of its operating companies into standalone services companies that provide these services to its operating companies and, in some cases, third parties. We and Altice N.V. believe this separation enables both businesses to be more focused and efficient in their core competencies, with Altice N.V.'s operating business enjoying financial savings and higher levels of customer satisfaction as a result of the tailored focus of the technical services business and its owner-operator culture. In addition, we believe the installation, repair, outside plant maintenance and network construction services we receive from ATS will be of higher quality and at a lower cost than we could achieve without ATS, including for the construction of our new FTTH network. Customer Experience We believe customer service is the cornerstone of our business. Accordingly, we make a concerted effort to continually improve each customer's experience and have made significant investments in our people, processes and technology to enhance our customers' experience and to reduce the number of times customers need to contact us. The insights from operational metrics help us focus our improvement efforts. For example, we link internal sales incentives to early churn and product mix as opposed to more traditional criteria of new sales, in order to refocus our organization away from churn retention to churn prevention. The number of technical service calls handled by our representatives in March 2017 was 23.8% lower compared to March 2016 while the number of customer service calls handled by our representatives was 17.3% lower over the same period. See "BusinessOur Business StrategyEnhance the Customer Experience." Our customer care centers are managed and operated locally, with the deployment and execution of end-to-end care strategies and initiatives conducted on a site-by-site basis. We have residential and commercial customer care centers located in Newark, NJ; Jericho, NY; Bronx, NY; Melville, NY; Tyler, TX; Lubbock, TX; Parkersburg, WV; and Lake Havasu, AZ. Our customer care centers function as an integrated system and utilize software programs that provide increased efficiencies and limited wait-times for customers requiring support. ATS' field technicians and schedulers utilize the same software programs for customers requiring in-person support. We provide service to our customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we have systems that allow our customer care centers to be accessed and managed remotely in the event that systems functionality is temporarily lost, which provides our customers access to customer service with limited disruption. We also utilize our customer portal to enable our customers to view and pay their bills online, obtain useful information and perform various equipment troubleshooting procedures. Our customers may also obtain support through our online chat, e-mail functionality and social media websites, including Twitter and Facebook. Network Management Our cable systems are generally designed with an HFC architecture that has proven to be highly flexible in meeting the increasing needs of our customers. We deliver our signals via laser-fed fiber optic cable from control centers known as headends and hubs to individual nodes. Each node is 136 Table of Contents connected to the individual homes served by us. A primary benefit of this design is that it pushes fiber optics closer to our customers' homes, which allows us to subdivide our systems into smaller service groups and make capital investments only in service groups experiencing higher than average service growth. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 96% of our basic pay television customers were served by systems with a capacity of at least 750 MHz and approximately 300 homes per node. Our Optimum network has been upgrated to nearly triple the maximum available broadband speeds and we have expanded our Gbps broadband service to approximately 60% of our Suddenlink footprint, compared to approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. More than 99% of our residential broadband Internet customers are connected to our national backbone with a presence in major carrier access points in New York, Dallas, Chicago, San Jose, Washington D.C. and Phoenix. This presence allows us to avoid significant Internet transit costs by establishing peering relationships with major Internet service and content providers enabling direct connectivity with them at these access points. ALTICE USA NATIONAL NETWORK MAP We also have a networking caching architecture that places highly viewed Internet traffic from the largest Internet-based content providers at the edge of the network closest to the customer to reduce bandwidth requirements across our national backbone, thus reducing operating expense. This collective network architecture also provides us with the capability to manage traffic across several Internet access points, thus helping to ensure Internet access redundancy and quality of service for our customers. Additionally, our national backbone connects most of our systems, which allows for an efficient and economical deployment of services from our centralized platforms that include telephone, VOD, network DVR, common pay television content, broadband Internet, hosted business solutions, provisioning, e-mail and other related services. We have also commenced a five-year plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our 137 Table of Contents Suddenlink footprint. We believe this FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements, fewer service outages and lower power usage, which we expect will drive further structural cost efficiencies. We have also focused on system reliability and disaster recovery as part of our national backbone and primary system strategy. For example, to help ensure a high level of reliability of our services, we implemented redundant power capability, as well as fiber route and carrier diversity in our networks serving most of our customers. With respect to disaster recovery, we invested in our telephone platform architecture for geo-redundancy to minimize downtime in the event of a disaster to any single facility. Additionally, we are working to implement a geo-redundant disaster recovery environment for our network operations center supporting both residential and business customers. In addition, we have expanded and refined our bandwidth utilization in capacity constrained systems in order to meet demand for new and improved advanced services. A key component to reclaim bandwidth was the digital delivery of pay television channels that were previously distributed in analog through the launch of digital simulcast, which duplicates analog channels as digital channels. Additionally, the deployment of lower-cost digital customer premises equipment, such as HD digital transport adapters, enabled the use of more efficient digital channels instead of analog channels, thus allowing the reclamation of expanded basic analog bandwidth in the targeted systems. This reclaimed analog bandwidth could then be repurposed for other advanced services such as additional HDTV services and faster Internet access speeds. This technology has the added benefit of providing improved picture and sound quality to customers for most of their pay television programming. Information Technology Our IT systems consist of billing, customer relationship management, business and operational support and sales force management systems. We are updating and simplifying our IT infrastructure through further investments, focusing on cost efficiencies, improved system reliability, functionality and scalability and enhancing the ability of our IT infrastructure to meet our ongoing business objectives. Further, we have made significant progress in integrating and consolidating the IT platforms and systems and streamlining the processes of Optimum and Suddenlink, which has driven operating efficiencies. Additionally, through investment in our IT platforms and focus on process improvement, we have simplified and harmonized our service offering bundles, optimized our technical service delivery and improved customer service. Suppliers Customer Premise and Network Equipment We purchase set-top boxes and other customer premise equipment from a limited number of vendors because each of our cable systems uses one or two proprietary technology architectures. We also buy HD, HD/DVRs and VOD equipment, routers, including the components of our new home communications hub, and other network equipment from a limited number of suppliers, including Altice Labs. See "Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to Our BusinessWe rely on network and information systems for our operations and a disruption or failure of, or defects in, those systems may disrupt our operations, damage our reputation with customers and adversely affect our results of operations." Broadband and Telephone Connectivity We deliver broadband and telephony services through our HFC network. We use circuits that are either owned by us or leased from third parties to connect to the Internet and the public switched telephone network. We pay fees for leased circuits based on the amount of capacity available to it and 138 Table of Contents pay for Internet connectivity based on the amount of IP-based traffic received from and sent over the other carrier's network. Competition We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. We believe our leading market positions in our footprint, technologically advanced network infrastructure, including our FTTH build-out, our new home communications hub and our focus on enhancing the customer experience, consistent with the Altice Way, favorably position us to compete in our industry. See also "Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to Our BusinessWe operate in a highly competitive business environment which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity." Broadband Services Competition Our broadband services face competition from broadband communications companies' DSL, FTTH and wireless broadband offerings as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including satellite-based broadband services. Current and future fixed and wireless Internet services, such as 3G, 4G and 5G fixed and wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets and smartphones, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our broadband services. Pay Television Services Competition We face intense competition from broadband communications companies with fiber-based networks, primarily Verizon, which has constructed a FTTH network plant that passes a significant number of households in our Optimum service area. We estimate that Verizon is currently able to sell a fiber-based pay television service, as well as broadband and VoIP services, to at least half of the households in our Optimum service area. In addition, Frontier offers pay television service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area. We also compete with DBS providers, such as DirecTV (a subsidiary of AT&T Inc.) and DISH. DirecTV and DISH offer one-way satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that are received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes. DirecTV has exclusive arrangements with the National Football League that give it access to programming that we cannot offer. AT&T also has an agreement to acquire Time Warner Inc., which owns a number of cable networks, including TBS, CNN and HBO, and Warner Bros. Entertainment, which produces television, film and home-video content. However, we believe cable-delivered VOD services, which include HD programming, offer a competitive advantage to DBS service because cable headends can provide two-way communication to deliver a large volume of programming which customers can access and control independently, whereas DBS technology can only make available a much smaller amount of programming with DVR-like customer control. Our pay television services also face competition from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other pay television programming over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices, such as Hulu, iTunes, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now and Sling TV. 139 Table of Contents Telephony Services Competition Our telephony service competes with wireline, wireless and OTT phone providers, such as Vonage, Skype, GoogleTalk, Facetime, WhatsApp and magicJack, as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service. In addition, we compete with other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying telephony services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our telephony services. Business Services Competition We operate in highly competitive business telecommunications market and compete primarily with local incumbent telephone companies, especially AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier and Verizon, as well as from a variety of other national and regional business services competitors. Advertising Sales Competition We face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors. Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new formats seek to attract the same advertisers. We compete for advertising revenue against, among others, local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio stations, print media and online advertising companies and content providers. Properties We own our headquarters building located in Bethpage, New York with approximately 558,000 square feet of space. In addition, we own or lease real estate throughout our operating areas where certain of our call centers, corporate facilities, business offices, earth stations, transponders, microwave towers, warehouses, headend equipment, hub sites, access studios and microwave receiving antennae are located. Our principal physical assets consist of cable operating plant and equipment, including signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, headend facilities, fiber optic transport networks, coaxial and distribution systems and equipment at or near customers' homes or places of business for each of the systems. The signal receiving apparatus typically includes a tower, antenna, ancillary electronic equipment and earth stations for reception of satellite signals. Headend facilities are located near the receiving devices. Our distribution system consists primarily of coaxial and fiber optic cables and related electronic equipment. Customer premise equipment consists of set-top devices, cable modems, Internet routers, wireless devices and media terminal adapters for telephone. Our cable plant and related equipment generally are attached to utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities; although in some areas the distribution cable is buried in underground ducts or directly in trenches. The physical components of the cable systems require maintenance and periodic upgrading to improve system performance and capacity. In addition, we operate a network operations center that monitors our network 24 hours a day, seven days a week, helping to ensure a high quality of service and reliability for both our residential and commercial customers. We own most of our service vehicles. We believe our properties, both owned and leased, are in good condition and are suitable and adequate for our operations. 140 Table of Contents Intellectual Property We rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use our technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. We also rely on our access to the proprietary technology of Altice N.V., including Altice Labs. We believe we own or have the right to use all of the intellectual property that is necessary for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it. Employees and Labor Relations As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 16,000 employees of which 227 were covered under collective bargaining agreements. On March 10, 2017, an additional 100 employees became represented by a union. We believe our relations with employees are satisfactory. Legal Proceedings Cable Operations Litigation In re Cablevision Consumer Litigation. Following expiration of the affiliation agreements for carriage of certain Fox broadcast stations and cable networks on October 16, 2010, News Corporation terminated delivery of the programming feeds to Optimum, and as a result, those stations and networks were unavailable on Optimum's cable television systems. On October 30, 2010, Optimum and Fox reached an agreement on new affiliation agreements for these stations and networks, and carriage was restored. Several purported class action lawsuits were subsequently filed on behalf of Optimum's customers seeking recovery for the lack of Fox programming. Those lawsuits were consolidated in an action before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and a consolidated complaint was filed in that court on February 22, 2011. Plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and consumer fraud, seeking unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees. On March 28, 2012, the Court ruled on Optimum's motion to dismiss, denying the motion with regard to plaintiffs' breach of contract claim, but granting it with regard to the remaining claims, which were dismissed. On April 16, 2012, plaintiffs filed a second consolidated amended complaint, which asserts a claim only for breach of contract. Optimum's answer was filed on May 2, 2012. On October 10, 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification and on December 13, 2012, a motion for partial summary judgment. On March 31, 2014, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and denied without prejudice plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. On May 30, 2014, the Court approved the form of class notice, and on October 7, 2014, approved the class notice distribution plan. The class notice distribution has been completed, and the opt-out period expired on February 27, 2015. Expert discovery commenced on May 5, 2014 and concluded on December 8 and 28, 2015, when the Court ruled on the pending expert discovery motions. On January 26, 2016, the Court approved a schedule for filing of summary judgment motions. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on March 31, 2016. Optimum filed its own summary judgment motion on June 13, 2016. The parties are actively engaged in settlement discussions although financial terms have not yet been finalized. The motions for summary judgment have been denied with leave to re-file in the event the discussions between the parties are not successful. In the period ended June 21, 2016 to December 31, 2016, Optimum recorded an estimated liability associated with a potential settlement totaling $5.2 million. The amount ultimately paid in connection with a possible settlement could exceed the amount recorded. Patent Litigation Certain subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in certain lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of the Company's businesses. In certain of these cases other industry participants are also defendants. In certain of these cases the Company 141 Table of Contents expects that any potential liability would be the responsibility of the Company's and its subsidiaries' equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual indemnification provisions. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Other Litigation In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is party to various lawsuits, some involving claims for substantial damages, in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these other matters cannot be predicted and the impact of the final resolution of these other matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these other lawsuits will in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due. 142 Table of Contents REGULATION Our cable and related services are subject to a variety of federal, state and local law and regulations. The Communications Act, and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, as well as other federal and state laws governing cable television, communications, consumer protection, privacy and related matters, affect significant aspects of our cable system and services operations. The following paragraphs describe the existing legal and regulatory requirements we believe are most significant to our cable system operations today. Our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative or judicial rulings. Cable Television Franchising. The Communications Act requires cable operators to obtain a non-exclusive franchise from state or local franchising authorities to provide cable service. Although the terms of franchise agreements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they typically require payment of franchise fees and contain regulatory provisions addressing, among other things, use of the right of way, service quality, cable service to schools and other public institutions, insurance, indemnity and sales of assets or changes in ownership. State and local franchising authority, however, must be exercised consistent with the Communications Act, which sets limits on franchising authorities' powers, including limiting franchise fees to no more than 5% of gross revenues from the provision of cable service, prohibiting franchising authorities from requiring us to carry specific programming services, and protecting the renewal expectation of franchisees by limiting the factors a franchising authority may consider and requiring a due process hearing before denying renewal. Even when franchises are renewed, however, the franchise authority may, except where prohibited by applicable law, seek to impose new and more onerous requirements as a condition of renewal. Similarly, if a franchising authority's consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance. They may also be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. The traditional cable franchising regime is undergoing significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. Several states have reduced or eliminated the role of local, municipal government in franchising in favor of state or system-wide franchises, and the trend has been toward consolidation of franchising authority at the state level, in part to accommodate the interests of new broadband and cable entrants over the last decade. At the same time, the FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (such as those affiliated with broadband communications companies) and reduce certain franchising burdens for these new entrants. The FCC adopted more modest relief for existing cable operators. Pricing and Packaging. The Communications Act and the FCC's rules limit the scope of price regulation for cable television services. Among other limitations, franchising authorities may regulate rates for only "basic" cable service. In 2015, the FCC adopted an order (which is now under appeal) reversing its historic approach to this local rate regulation. Previously, rate regulation was in effect in a community unless and until a cable operator successfully petitioned the FCC for relief by showing the existence of "effective competition" (as defined under federal law) in the community. The FCC's 2015 Order reversed that presumption, barring franchise authority rate regulation absent an affirmative showing by the franchising authority that there is an absence of effective competition. As none of our franchise authorities have filed the necessary rate regulation certification, none of our pay television customers are currently subject to rate regulation. Our franchise authorities generally retain the right to certify an absence of effective competition in the future, but the 2015 Order (unless overturned) should make it more difficult for the franchise authorities to do so. 143 Table of Contents There have been frequent calls to impose further rate regulation on the cable industry. It is possible that Congress or the FCC may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. For example, there has been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an à la carte basis. In addition, the FCC recently initiated a proceeding exploring how programming practices involving MVPDs affect the availability of diverse and independent programming. As we attempt to respond to a changing marketplace with competitive marketing and pricing practices, we may face regulations that impede our ability to compete. Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent. Cable operators are required to carry, without compensation, programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations that elect "must carry" status. Alternatively, local commercial broadcast television stations may elect "retransmission consent," giving up their must-carry right and instead negotiating with cable systems the terms on which the cable systems may carry the station's programming content. Cable systems generally may not carry a broadcast station that has elected retransmission consent without the station's consent. The terms of retransmission consent agreements frequently include the payment of compensation to the station. Broadcast stations must elect "must carry" or retransmission consent every three years. A substantial number of local broadcast stations currently carried by our cable systems have elected to negotiate for retransmission consent. In the most recent retransmission consent negotiations, popular television stations have demanded substantial compensation increases, thereby increasing our operating costs. Ownership Limitations. Federal regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of ownership restrictions, which limited the size of certain media entities and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises. Through a series of legislative, regulatory, and judicial actions, most of these restrictions have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed. Changes in this regulatory area could alter the business environment in which we operate. Set-Top Boxes. The Communications Act includes a provision that requires the FCC to take certain steps to support the development of a retail market for "navigation devices," such as cable set-top boxes. As a result, the FCC has adopted certain mandates, from time to time, to require cable operators to accommodate third party navigation devices, sometimes imposing substantial development and operating requirements on the industry. In 2016, the FCC undertook an additional rulemaking aimed at extending some of these mandates to require that MVPDs accommodate third party applications would allow access MVPD video content without the need for a set-top box and without using or accessing an MVPDs user interface. While that effort has not advanced, the FCC may in the future consider implementing similar measures to promote the competitive availability of retail set-top boxes or third party navigation options that could impact our customers' experience, our ability to capture user interactions to refine and enhance our services, and our ability to provide a consistent customer support environment. PEG and Leased Access. Franchising authorities may require that we support the delivery and support for public, educational, or governmental ("PEG") channels on our cable systems. In addition to providing PEG channels, we must make a limited number of commercial leased access channels available to third parties (including parties with potentially competitive pay television services) at regulated rates. The FCC adopted revised rules several years ago mandating a significant reduction in the rates that operators can charge commercial leased access users. These rules were stayed, however, by a federal court, pending a cable industry appeal. This matter currently remains pending, and the revised rules are not yet in effect. Although commercial leased access activity historically has been 144 Table of Contents relatively limited, increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable systems. Pole Attachments. The company makes extensive use of utility poles and conduit owned by other utilities to attach and install the facilities that are integral to our network and services. The Communications Act requires most utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits for access to attach such facilities at regulated rates. States (or, where states choose not to regulate, the FCC) regulate utility company rates for the rental of pole and conduit space used by companies, including operators like us, to provide cable, telecommunications services, and Internet access services, unless states establish their own regulations in this area. Many states in which we operate have elected to set their own pole attachment rules. In 2011 and again in 2015, the FCC amended its pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. The 2011 order allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments, but generally strengthens the cable industry's ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms and conditions. Additionally, the 2011 order reduces the federal rate formula previously applicable to "telecommunications" attachments to closely approximate the more favorable rate formula applicable to "cable" attachments. The 2015 Order (which is now under appeal) continues this rate reconciliation, effectively closing a remaining "loophole" that potentially allowed for significantly higher rates for telecommunications attachments in certain scenarios. Neither the 2011 order nor the 2015 Order directly affects the rate in states that self-regulate (rather than allowing the FCC to regulate) pole rates, but many of those states have substantially the same rate for cable and telecommunications attachments. Adverse changes to the pole attachment rate structure, rate, and classifications could significantly increase our annual pole attachment costs. Program Access. The program access rules generally prohibit a cable operator from improperly influencing an affiliated satellite-delivered cable programming service to discriminate unfairly against an unaffiliated distributor where the purpose or effect of such influence is to significantly hinder or prevent the competitor from providing satellite-delivered cable programming. FCC rules also allow a competing distributor to bring a complaint against a cable-affiliated terrestrially-delivered programmer or its affiliated cable operator for alleged violations of this rule, and seek reformed terms of carriage as remedy. Program Carriage. The FCC's program carriage rules prohibit us from requiring that an unaffiliated programmer grant us a financial interest or exclusive carriage rights as a condition of its carriage on our cable systems and prohibit us from unfairly discriminating against unaffiliated programmers in the terms and conditions of carriage on the basis of their nonaffiliation. On October 12, 2011, Game Show Network ("GSN") filed a program carriage complaint against Optimum, alleging that we discriminated against it in the terms and conditions of carriage based on GSN's lack of affiliation with us. Although the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC recommended on October 15, 2015, that the administrative law judge adjudicating this dispute find in our favor because GSN had not satisfied its burden of proving that we discriminated against it on the basis of affiliation, the administrative law judge issued his initial decision in GSN's favor on November 23, 2016, requiring that we restore GSN to the expanded basic tier. We have appealed this decision to the FCC and are seeking to delay implementation of the remedy ordered by the administrative law judge pending resolution of the appeal. We believe GSN's claims are without merit and we are defending ourselves vigorously. Exclusive Access to Multitenant Buildings. The FCC has prohibited cable operators from entering into or enforcing exclusive agreements with owners of multitenant buildings under which the operator is the only MVPD with access to the building. 145 Table of Contents CALM Act. The FCC's rules require us to ensure that all commercials carried on our cable service comply with specified volume standards. Privacy and Data Security. In the course of providing our services, we collect certain information about our subscribers and their use of our services. We also collect certain information regarding potential subscribers and other individuals. Our collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information is subject to a variety of federal and state privacy requirements, including those imposed specifically on cable operators and telecommunications service providers by the Communications Act. We are also subject to data security obligations, as well as requirements to provide notice to individuals and governmental entities in the event of certain data security breaches, and such breaches, depending on their scope and consequences, may lead to litigation and enforcement actions with the potential of substantial monetary forfeitures or to adversely affect our brand. As cable operators provide interactive and other advanced services, additional privacy and data security requirements may arise through legislation, regulation or judicial decisions. For example, the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 has been extended to cover online interactive services through which customers can buy or rent movies. In addition, Congress, the FTC, and other lawmakers and regulators are all considering whether to adopt additional measures that could impact the collection, use, and disclosure of subscriber information in connection with the delivery of advertising and other services to consumers customized to their interests. In October 2016, the FCC adopted new privacy and data security rules governing the use of customer information by broadband ISPs, including cable ISPs and providers of VoIP. These new rules permit the collection and use of non-sensitive customer information subject to the customers' ability to opt out, but require the customers' opt-in before access, use or disclosure of sensitive proprietary information. These new rules are more stringent than the FTC's privacy standards. The FCC suspended the data security portion of these rules in February. In March, both houses of Congress voted to overturn all of the rules. This legislation was signed by the President in April and it is now effective. Federal Copyright Regulation. We are required to pay copyright royalty fees on a semi-annual basis to receive a statutory compulsory license to carry broadcast television content. These fees are subject to periodic audit by the content owners. The amount of a cable operator's royalty fee payments are determined by a statutory formula that takes into account various factors, including the amount of "gross receipts" received from subscribers for "basic" service, the number of "distant" broadcast signals carried and the characteristics of those distant signals (e.g., network, independent or noncommercial). Certain elements of the royalty formula are subject to adjustment from time to time, which can lead to increases in the amount of our semi-annual royalty payments. The U.S. Copyright Office, which administers the collection of royalty fees, has made recommendations to Congress for changes in or elimination of the statutory compulsory licenses for cable television carriage of broadcast signals and the U.S. Government Accountability Office is conducting a statutorily-mandated inquiry into whether the cable compulsory license should be phased out. Changes to copyright regulations could adversely affect the ability of our cable systems to obtain such programming, and could increase the cost of such programming. Similarly, we must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future. Access for Persons with Disabilities. The FCC's rules require us to ensure that persons with disabilities can more fully access the programming we carry. We are required to provide closed captions and pass through video description to subscribers on some networks we carry, and to provide an easy means of activating closed captioning and to ensure the audio accessibility of emergency information navigation capabilities of our video offerings. 146 Table of Contents Other Regulation. We are subject to various other regulations, including those related to political broadcasting; home wiring; the blackout of certain network and syndicated programming; prohibitions on transmitting obscene programming; limitations on advertising in children's programming; and standards for emergency alerts, as well as telemarketing and general consumer protection laws and equal employment opportunity obligations. The FCC also imposes various technical standards on our operations. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the FCC and the states are examining whether new requirements are necessary to improve the resiliency of communications networks, potentially including cable networks. Each of these regulations restricts our business practices to varying degrees. The FCC can aggressively enforce compliance with its regulations and consumer protection policies, including the imposition of substantial monetary sanctions. It is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulations of cable systems in the future, and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact our business. Broadband Regulatory Classification. Broadband Internet access services were traditionally classified by the FCC as "information services" for regulatory purposes, a type of service that is subject to a lesser degree of regulation than "telecommunications services." In 2015, the FCC reversed this determination and classified broadband Internet access services as "telecommunications services." This reclassification has subjected our broadband Internet access service to greater regulation, although the FCC did not apply all telecommunications service obligations to broadband Internet access service. The 2015 Order has been upheld by a panel of United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, although the order remains on appeal before that court sitting en banc. The 2015 Order could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may justify additional FCC regulation or support efforts by States to justify additional regulation of broadband Internet access services. Net Neutrality. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted a new "Open Internet" framework that expanded disclosure requirements on ISPs, prohibited blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization of Internet traffic on the basis of the content, and imposed a "general conduct standard" that prohibits unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. Access for Persons with Disabilities. The FCC's rules require us to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to "advanced communications services" ("ACS"), such as electronic messaging and interoperable video conferencing. They also require that certain pay television programming delivered via Internet Protocol include closed captioning and require entities distributing such programming to end users to pass through such captions and identify programming that should be captioned. Other Regulation. The 2015 Order also subjected broadband providers' Internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential FCC oversight and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters. In addition, our provision of Internet services also subjects us to the limitations on use and disclosure of user communications and records contained in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. Broadband Internet access service is also subject to other federal and state privacy laws applicable to electronic communications. Additionally, providers of broadband Internet access services must comply with CALEA, which requires providers to make their services and facilities accessible for law enforcement intercept requests. Various other federal and state laws apply to providers of services that are accessible through broadband Internet access service, including copyright laws, telemarketing laws, prohibitions on obscenity, and a ban on unsolicited commercial e-mail, and privacy and data security laws. Online content we provide is also subject to some of these laws. 147 Table of Contents Other forms of regulation of broadband Internet access service currently being considered by the FCC, Congress or state legislatures include consumer protection requirements, cyber security requirements, consumer service standards, requirements to contribute to universal service programs and requirements to protect personally identifiable customer data from theft. Pending and future legislation in this area could adversely affect our operations as an Internet service provider and our relationship with our Internet customers. Additionally, from time to time the FCC and Congress have considered whether to subject broadband Internet access services to the federal Universal Service Fund ("USF") contribution requirements. Any contribution requirements adopted for Internet access services would impose significant new costs on our broadband Internet service. At the same time, the FCC is changing the manner in which Universal Service funds are distributed. By focusing on broadband and wireless deployment, rather than traditional telephone service, the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings VoIP Services We provide telephony services using VoIP technology ("interconnected VoIP"). The FCC has adopted several regulations for interconnected VoIP services, as have several states, especially as it relates to core customer and safety issues such as e911, local number portability, disability access, outage reporting, universal service contributions, and regulatory reporting requirements. The FCC has not, however, formally classified interconnected VoIP services as either information services or telecommunications services. In this vacuum, some states have asserted more expansive rights to regulate interconnected VoIP services, while others have adopted laws that bar the state commission from regulating VoIP service. Universal Service. Interconnected VoIP services must contribute to the USF used to subsidize communication services provided to low income households, to customers in rural and high cost areas, and to schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. The amount of universal service contribution required of interconnected VoIP service providers is based on a percentage of revenues earned from interstate and international services provided to end users. We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with FCC rules. The FCC has ruled that states may impose state universal service fees on interconnected VoIP providers. Local Number Portability. The FCC requires interconnected VoIP service providers and their "numbering partners" to ensure that their customers have the ability to port their telephone numbers when changing providers. We also contribute to federal funds to meet the shared costs of local number portability and the costs of North American Numbering Plan Administration. Intercarrier Compensation. In an October 2011 reform order and subsequent clarifying orders, the FCC revised the regime governing payments among providers of telephony services for the exchange of calls between and among different networks ("intercarrier compensation") to, among other things, explicitly include interconnected VoIP. In that Order, the FCC determined that intercarrier compensation for all terminating traffic, including VoIP traffic exchanged in TDM format, will be phased down over several years to a "bill-and-keep" regime, with no compensation between carriers for most terminating traffic by 2018. Other Regulation. Interconnected VoIP service providers are required to provide enhanced 911 emergency services to their customers; protect customer proprietary network information from unauthorized disclosure to third parties; report to the FCC on service outages; comply with telemarketing regulations and other privacy and data security requirements; comply with disabilities access requirements and service discontinuance obligations; comply with call signaling requirements; and comply with CALEA standards. In August 2015, the FCC adopted new rules to improve the 148 Table of Contents resiliency of the communications network. Under the new rules, providers of telephony services, including interconnected VoIP service providers, must make available eight hours of standby backup power for consumers to purchase at the point of sale. The rules also require that providers inform new and current customers about service limitations during power outages and steps that consumers can take to address those risks. Telephony Services We operate traditional telecommunications services under the trade name Optimum Lightpath in various state subsidiaries, and those services are largely governed under rules established for CLECs under the Communications Act. The Communications Act entitles our CLEC subsidiaries to certain rights, but as telecommunications carriers, it also subjects them to regulation by the FCC and the states. Their designation as telecommunications carriers also results in other regulations that may affect them and the services they offer. Interconnection and Intercarrier Compensation. The Communications Act requires telecommunications carriers to interconnect directly or indirectly with other telecommunications carriers. Under the FCC's intercarrier compensation rules, we are entitled, in some cases, to compensation from carriers when they use our network to terminate or originate calls and in other cases are required to compensate another carrier for using its network to originate or terminate traffic. The FCC and state regulatory commissions, including those in the states in which we operate, have adopted limits on the amounts of compensation that may be charged for certain types of traffic. As noted above, the FCC has determined that intercarrier compensation for all terminating traffic will be phased down over several years to a "bill-and-keep" regime, with no compensation between carriers for most terminating traffic by 2018. Universal Service. Our CLEC subsidiaries are required to contribute to the USF. The amount of universal service contribution required of us is based on a percentage of revenues earned from interstate and international services provided to end users. We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with FCC rules. The FCC has ruled that states may impose state universal service fees on CLEC telecommunications services. Other Regulation. Our CLEC subsidiaries' telecommunications services are subject to other FCC requirements, including protecting the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information; meeting certain notice requirements in the event of service termination; compliance with disabilities access requirements; compliance with CALEA standards; outage reporting; and the payment of fees to fund local number portability administration and the North American Numbering Plan. As noted above, the FCC and states are examining whether new requirements are necessary to improve the resiliency of communications networks. Communications with our customers are also subject to FCC, FTC and state regulations on telemarketing and the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail and fax messages, as well as additional privacy and data security requirements. State Regulation. Our CLEC subsidiaries' telecommunications services are subject to regulation by state commissions in each state where we provide services. In order to provide our services, we must seek approval from the state regulatory commission or be registered to provide services in each state where we operate and may at times require local approval to construct facilities. Regulatory obligations vary from state to state and include some or all of the following requirements: filing tariffs (rates, terms and conditions); filing operational, financial, and customer service reports; seeking approval to transfer the assets or capital stock of the broadband communications company; seeking approval to issue stocks, bonds and other forms of indebtedness of the broadband communications company; reporting customer service and quality of service requirements; outage reporting; making contributions to state universal service support programs; paying regulatory and state Telecommunications Relay Service and E911 fees; geographic build-out; and other matters relating to competition. 149 Table of Contents Other Services We may provide other services and features over our cable system, such as games and interactive advertising that may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy and consumer protection regulations. We also maintain various websites that provide information and content regarding our businesses. The operation of these websites is also subject to a similar range of regulations. Environmental Regulations Our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. In part as a result of the increasing public awareness concerning the importance of environmental regulations, these regulations have become more stringent over time. Amended or new regulations could impact our operations and costs. 150 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth the names, ages as of March 31, 2017, and positions of the individuals who are expected to constitute our directors and executive officers immediately prior to the completion of this offering.

Our named executive officers ("NEOs") consist of the executive officers who appear in the "Summary Compensation Table" below:  Dexter Goei, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO);  Charles Stewart, Co-President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO);  Hakim Boubazine, Co-President and Chief Operating Officer (COO);  David Connolly, Executive Vice President, General Counsel; and  Lisa Rosenblum, Vice Chairman Messrs. Goei, Stewart and Boubazine are currently employed by Altice Management Americas, a subsidiary of Altice N.V., and provide services to Altice USA under a management agreement. Immediately prior to the completion of this offering, Messrs. Goei, Stewart and Boubazine will become employees of the Company. Executive Compensation Philosophy The Company's executive compensation philosophy is based on the following principles:  provide total compensation that attracts, motivates and retains candidates with the knowledge, expertise and experience required for each specific role;  an appropriate proportion of the overall package should be delivered through variable pay elements linked to performance over the short- and long-term;  encourage and reward performance that will lead to long-term enhancement of stockholder value; and  take into account compensation practices in the markets in which we operate and compete for talent. Elements of Compensation Base Salary The named executive officers received a base salary to compensate them for services to the company. The base salary is intended to provide a fixed component of compensation reflecting various factors such as the nature of the role, the experience and performance of the individual. Annual Bonus For 2016, each of our named executive officers was eligible to earn an annual performance-based cash bonus from the Company. For each of our named executive officers, other than our CEO, our board of directors established management bonus performance metrics that varied depending upon the eligible employee's specific business unit. These performance objectives included a combination of revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets. For employees who joined the Company as part of the Optimum Acquisition or were hired after June 2016 into the corporate business unit, performance is based on Optimum's financial and operational results during the third and fourth quarter of 2016. 156 Table of Contents Carried Unit Plan On July 13, 2016, the Neptune Management Limited Partnership Carry Unit Plan was created to provide participants, including our named executive officers, with an opportunity to participate in the long-term growth and financial success of our operations in the form of units of ownership ("profits interest") in Neptune Management Limited Partnership, a parent of Altice USA (the "Units"). A profits interest gives the participant the right to share in specified future profits and appreciation in value that the investors of the limited partnership may receive, including profits paid upon a sale of the investors' interests. Economically, a profits interest is generally equivalent to a stock option granted on the stock of a corporation. Insofar as a profits interests has no value at grant and only realizes value if the limited partnership from which it is granted appreciates in value and/or has profits, participants are eligible for appreciation following the grant date. All named executive officers received Units that vest as follows: 50% of the Units vest on the second anniversary of the vesting start date; 25% of the Units vest on the third anniversary of the vesting start date; and 25% of the Units will vest on the fourth anniversary of the vesting start date. All unvested Units automatically vest in the case of a change of control of Altice USA, Inc. In the event of an IPO of Altice's US operations, vested Units may be exchanged for Class A common stock in the newly listed entity, but will not result in accelerated vesting of the Units. Benefits The transfer of any item of value by Neptune Management Limited Partnership to participants with respect to Units granted to such participants does not result in a tax deduction for Altice USA. The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the health and welfare benefit plans made available to the other benefits-eligible employees of the Company, including, for example, medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability coverage. The named executive officers are also eligible to participate in the Company's Cablevision 401(k) Plan and may contribute into their plan accounts a percentage of their eligible pay on a before-tax basis and after-tax basis. The Company matches 100% of the first 4% of eligible pay contributed by participating employees. In addition, the Company may make an additional discretionary year-end contribution. Any discretionary year-end contribution, if approved by the Company, will be provided to all eligible participants who are active on the last day of the plan year and who complete 1,000 hours of service in such plan year. In 2016, the Company made a discretionary year-end contribution of 2% of eligible pay with respect to the 2016 plan year. The Company also sponsors a Suddenlink 401(k) Plan for legacy Suddenlink employees, pursuant to which the Company matches 50% of the first 6% of eligible pay contributed. No named executive officer participated in the Suddenlink Plan in 2016. Employment and Termination Agreements None of the NEOs have an employment agreement related to their service with Altice USA. Tax Deductibility of Compensation Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, establishes a $1 million limit on the amount that a publicly held corporation may deduct for compensation paid to the chief executive officer and the next three most highly paid named executive officers (other than the chief financial officer) in a taxable year. This limitation does not apply to any compensation that is "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), which is defined as compensation paid in connection with certain stock options or that is paid only if the individual's performance meets pre-established objective goals based on performance criteria established under a plan approved by 157 Table of Contents stockholders. Because we do not currently have any publicly held common stock, the restrictions of Section 162(m) do not currently apply to us.

Effective April 15, 2015, the Plan was further amended to freeze participation and benefit accruals for the remaining employees covered by a collective bargaining relationship. A notional account is maintained for each participant under the plan (including one named executive officer), which is credited with monthly interest credits based on the average of the annual rate of interest on the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bonds for the months of September, October and November of the prior year. Monthly interest credits continue to be made to participant accounts until distribution of the accounts following termination of employment. All active participants are fully vested in their cash balance account. Upon retirement or other termination of employment with the Company, the participant may elect a distribution of the vested portion of the cash balance account. The normal form of benefit payment for an unmarried participant is a single life annuity and the normal form of benefit payment for a married participant is a 50% joint and survivor annuity. The participant, with spousal consent if applicable, can waive the normal form and elect a single life annuity or a lump sum. Cablevision Excess Cash Balance Pension Plan The Company's Excess Cash Balance Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that is intended to provide eligible participants, including one named executive officer, with the portion of their benefit that cannot be paid to them under the Cash Balance Pension Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limits applicable to tax-qualified plans. Effective December 31, 2013, the Excess Cash Balance Plan was amended to freeze participation and future benefit accruals for all Company employees. The Company maintains a notional excess cash balance account for each eligible participant, and, credits each excess cash balance account monthly with interest at the same rate used under the Cash Balance Pension Plan. Monthly interest credits continue to be made to participant accounts until distribution of the accounts following termination of employment. All active participants are fully vested in their excess cash balance account. The excess cash balance account, to the extent vested, is paid in a lump sum to the participant as soon as practicable following his or her retirement or other termination of employment with the Company. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table Name Plan Executive Contributions in Last FY ($) Registrant Contributions in Last FY ($) Aggregate Earnings in Last FY ($) Aggregate Withdrawals/ ($) Aggregate Balance at Last FYE ($) Lisa Rosenblum The Cablevision Excess Savings Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that operates in conjunction with the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan. Effective December 31, 2016, the Excess 159 Table of Contents Savings Plan was frozen (i.e., no future employee and Company contributions are permitted under the Plan for 2017 and thereafter). Participant notional account balances continue to be credited monthly with the rate of return earned by the stable value investment option available under the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan. For 2016, Ms. Rosenblum, whose contributions to the 401(k) Plan were limited as a result of the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit or as a result of reaching the maximum 401(k) deferral limit ($24,000, if age 50 or over) continued to make pre-tax contributions under the Excess Savings Plan equal to 6% of her eligible pay. The Company made matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 4% of eligible pay contributed. In addition, for 2016, the Company made its final discretionary contribution equal to 2% of eligible pay in excess of the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit in the first quarter of 2017; such contribution is not reflected in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table above. A participant is always fully vested in the participant's own contributions and vests in the Company contributions over three years from date of hire (subject to full vesting upon death, disability or retirement after attaining age 65). Distributions are made in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the participant's termination of employment with the Company. Post-Termination Compensation Our executives have helped build the Company into the successful enterprise that it is today and we believe that post-termination benefits are integral to the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified executives. The following tables summarize the estimated amounts payable to each named executive officer in the event of a termination from employment or change in control as of December 31, 2016. A narrative description follows the table. Benefits Payable as a Result of Termination of Employment by the Company Without Cause Name Severance ($) Bonus ($) Dexter Goei Charles Stewart Hakim Boubazine David Connolly Lisa Rosenblum Benefits Payable as a Result of Termination of Employment in connection with a Change of Control Transaction Name Severance ($) Bonus ($) Unvested Carry Units ($) Dexter Goei Charles Stewart Hakim Boubazine David Connolly Lisa Rosenblum New Incentive Plan In connection with the offering, we intend to adopt the Altice USA 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan, subject to approval by our board of directors. Under the plan we may grant awards of options, restricted shares, restricted share units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock, performance stock 160 Table of Contents units, cash performance units and other awards.

The number of shares remaining available for issuance shall be reduced by the number of shares subject to outstanding awards and, for awards that are not denominated by shares, by the number of shares actually delivered upon settlement or payment of the award. For purposes of determining the number of shares that remain available for issuance under the plan, the number of shares corresponding to awards under the plan that are forfeited or cancelled or otherwise expire for any reason without having been exercised or settled or that are settled through the issuance of consideration other than shares (including, without limitation, cash) shall be added back to the plan limit and again be available for the grant of awards; provided , however , that this provision shall not be applicable with respect to (i) the cancellation of a stock appreciation right granted in tandem with an option upon the exercise of the option or (ii) the cancellation of an option granted in tandem with a stock appreciation right upon the exercise of the stock appreciation right. In addition, (i) the number of shares that are tendered by a participant or withheld by the Company to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the participant's tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting, exercise or settlement of an award and (ii) the number of shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right but not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of such option or SAR shall be added back to the plan limit and again be available for the grant of awards.

The Compensation Committee may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment or provision of services), or any other basis determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. The terms and conditions of each award shall be set forth in an award document in a form approved by the Compensation Committee. The award document shall contain terms and conditions not inconsistent with the plan. The Compensation Committee may at any time following grant (i) accelerate the vesting, exercisability, lapse of restrictions, settlement or payment of any award, (ii) eliminate the restrictions and conditions applicable to an award or (iii) extend the post-termination exercise period of an outstanding award (subject to the limitations of Section 409A). 162 Table of Contents PRINCIPAL AND SELLING STOCKHOLDERS The following table presents certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of , and as adjusted to reflect the sale of Class A common stock offered by us and the selling stockholders in this offering assuming no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, by:  each of our current directors;  each of our named executive officers;  all of our directors and executive officers as a group;  each stockholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock; and  each selling stockholder.

Right of First Refusal Any proposed sale of shares of common stock held by certain members of our management will be subject to a right of first refusal by an entity controlled by Patrick Drahi. Our Policy Regarding Related-Party Transactions All agreements and transactions between us, on the one hand, and affiliates of Altice N.V. on the other hand, will be subject to the Related-Party Transaction Approval Policy that our board of directors will adopt prior to the completion of this offering. Under this policy, the Audit Committee of the board consisting entirely of directors who have been determined by the board to be independent directors for purposes of the corporate governance standards reviews and approves or takes such other action 165 Table of Contents as it may deem appropriate with respect to transactions involving the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and in which any director, officer, greater than 5% stockholder of the Company or any other "related person" as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act ("Item 404") has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. This approval requirement covers any transaction that meets the related-party disclosure requirements of the SEC as set forth in Item 404. Under the Related-Party Transaction Approval Policy, the Audit Committee similarly oversees approval of transactions and arrangements between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Altice N.V. and its other subsidiaries, on the other hand, to the extent involving amounts in excess of the dollar threshold set forth in Item 404 (the "Item 404 Threshold"). The Related-Party Transaction Approval Policy provides that to simplify the administration of the approval process under the Related-Party Transaction Approval Policy, the Audit Committee may, where it deems it to be appropriate, establish guidelines for certain types of these transactions. The approval requirement will not apply to the implementation and administration of intercompany arrangements under the Related-Party Transaction Approval Policy, but covers any amendments, modifications, terminations or extensions involving amounts in excess of the Item 404 Threshold, as well as the handling and resolution of any disputes involving amounts in excess of the Item 404 Threshold. The Company's executive officers and directors who are also senior executives or directors of Altice N.V., as the case may be, may participate in the negotiation, execution, amendment, modification, or termination of intercompany arrangements subject to the Related-Party Transaction Approval Policy, as well as in any resolution of disputes under intercompany arrangements, on behalf of either or both of the Company and Altice N.V., as the case may be, under the direction of the Audit Committee when acting on behalf of the Company. The Related-Party Transaction Approval Policy cannot be amended or terminated without the prior approval of a majority of the Audit Committee and by a majority of the directors elected by the holders of Class B common stock. 166 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK General The following description of our capital stock and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws are summaries and are qualified by reference to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws that will be in effect on the closing of this offering. Copies of these documents will be filed with the SEC as exhibits to our registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part. The descriptions of the common stock and preferred stock reflect changes to our capital structure that will be in effect on the closing of this offering. On the closing of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide for three classes of common stock: Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize shares of undesignated preferred stock, the rights, preferences and privileges of which may be designated from time to time by our board of directors. On the closing of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of shares, all with a par value of $0.01 per share, of which:  shares are designated Class A common stock;  shares are designated Class B common stock;  shares are designated Class C common stock; and  shares are designated preferred stock. Upon consummation of this offering, there will be shares of our Class A common stock issued and outstanding and shares of our Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock Voting Rights Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to twenty-five votes per share on any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Except as set forth below or as required by Delaware law, holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of our stockholders. If we issue any shares of Class C common stock, they will not be entitled to any votes on any matter that is submitted to a vote of our stockholders, except as provided in our certificate of incorporation or as required by Delaware law. Delaware law would require the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock to vote separately as a single class on a matter if we were to seek to:  amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of a class of stock (except as otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation) or increase or decrease the par value of a class of stock; or  amend our certificate of incorporation in a manner that altered or changed the powers, preferences, or special rights of a class of stock in a manner that affected them adversely. As permitted by Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the number of authorized shares of common stock or any class of common stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of common stock then outstanding) by the affirmative 167 Table of Contents vote of the holders of a majority of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting together as a single class. Each of our directors and director nominees will stand for election at each of our annual meetings of stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors. Rather, a majority of the votes cast is required for a director or director nominee to be duly elected in any uncontested election. Because our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock will be able to elect all of our directors. Stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock also will be able to remove each of our directors with or without cause. Pursuant to the stockholders' agreement we will enter into with Altice N.V. and an entity controlled by Patrick Drahi in connection with this offering, Altice N.V. will have the right to nominate a majority of the members of our board of directors, one of which will be an individual designated by the entity controlled by Patrick Drahi and Altice N.V. will agree to vote its shares in favor of electing the individual designated by the entity controlled by Patrick Drahi. If the director designated by the entity controlled by Patrick Drahi resigns or is removed from the board of directors, only another director designated by the the entity controlled by Patrick Drahi may fill the vacancy. See "Stockholders' Agreement." Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also gives the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of our capital stock the right to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting and without notice. Economic Rights Except as otherwise expressly provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or required by Delaware law, all shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects for all matters, including those described below. Dividends and Distributions. Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will be entitled to share equally, on a per share basis, in any dividend or distribution of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to declare and pay dividends and only then at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine. In the event that a dividend is paid in the form of shares of our capital stock or rights to acquire or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our capital stock either (A) the holders of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock shall receive the identical class of securities on an equal per share basis, or (B) (i) the holders of shares of Class A common stock shall receive Class A common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock or rights to acquire such securities, as the case may be; (ii) the holders of shares of Class B common stock shall receive Class B common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class B common stock or rights to acquire such securities, as the case may be; and (iii) the holders of shares of Class C common stock shall receive Class C common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class C common stock or rights to acquire such securities, as the case may be. However, the board of directors may pay or make a disparate dividend or distribution per share of Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock (whether in the amount of such dividend or distribution payable per share, the form in which such dividend or distribution is payable, the timing of the payment or otherwise) if such disparate dividend or distribution is approved in advance by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock, each voting separately as a class. 168 Table of Contents Liquidation Rights. Upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders will be distributable ratably among the holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock unless different treatment of such class with respect to distributions upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up is approved in advance by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, each voting separately as a class. Immediately prior to the earlier of (i) any distribution of our assets in connection with a liquidation, dissolution or winding up; or (ii) any record date established to determine the holders of our capital stock entitled to receive such distribution, each share of outstanding Class C common stock shall be automatically converted into one share of Class A common stock. Equal Status. Except as expressly provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all respects as to all matters. In the event of (i) a consolidation or merger of us with or into any other entity; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer by any person or entity pursuant to an agreement to which we are a party or that we recommend, or (iii) a sale by Altice N.V. or any of its subsidiaries that holds shares of our Class B common stock or, solely in the event shares of our Class B common stock have been distributed to Patrick Drahi or entities under his control, Patrick Drahi or such entities (together with Altice N.V. and any of its subsidiaries that hold such shares, the "Altice Holders"), in one or a series of related transactions, whether to a single purchaser or purchasers constituting a "group" as defined in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, of shares of Class B common stock representing (a) at least 40% of the votes entitled to be cast by all stockholders entitled to vote in an election of directors and (b) a greater number of votes than the Altice Holders and their affiliates collectively are entitled to cast immediately following such sale, the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock shall be entitled to participate proportionately and to receive, or to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any securities consideration is paid, distributed or offered to holders of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock in any such transaction, such consideration may differ only in terms of voting rights such that the holder of a share of Class B common stock shall receive or have the right to elect to receive securities having twenty-five times the voting power of any securities that the holder of a share of Class A common stock shall receive or have the right to elect to receive, and any securities that the holder of a share of Class C common stock shall receive or have the right to elect to receive shall either have no voting rights or the same voting rights as the securities that a holder of Class A common stock shall receive or have the right to elect to receive. Subdivisions and Combinations. If we subdivide or combine in any manner outstanding shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, or Class C common stock, the outstanding shares of the other classes will be subdivided or combined in the same manner. No Preemptive or Similar Rights Our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights and are not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions, except for the conversion provisions with respect to the Class B common stock described below. 169 Table of Contents Conversion and Transfers Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. All shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for the automatic conversion of shares of our Class B common stock upon transfer under any circumstances. As a result, the holders of Class B common stock are free to transfer them without converting them into shares of our Class A common stock. Any shares of Class B common stock that are converted into Class A common stock may not be reissued. The disparate voting rights of the shares of our Class B common stock will not change upon transfer unless first converted into shares of Class A common stock. Upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock, the holders of majority of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock at the time of such final conversion, may, in connection with such final conversion, require that each share of Class C common stock shall automatically be converted into one share of Class A common stock on a date fixed by our board of directors, which date shall be no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. In addition, as described above, upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up, each share of Class C common stock will automatically be converted into one share of Class A common stock. Preferred Stock On the closing of this offering and under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors may, without further action by our stockholders, fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of up to an aggregate of shares of preferred stock in one or more series and authorize their issuance. These rights, preferences and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock. Any issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock, and the likelihood that such holders would receive dividend payments and payments on liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control or other corporate action. On the closing of this offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding. We have no present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock. Stockholders' Agreement In connection with this offering, we will to enter into a stockholders' agreement with Altice N.V. and an entity controlled by Patrick Drahi. Pursuant to this agreement, Altice N.V. will have the right to nominate a majority of the members of our board of directors, one of which will be an individual designated by the entity controlled by Patrick Drahi and Altice N.V. will agree to vote its shares in favor of electing the individual designated by the entity controlled by Patrick Drahi. If the director designated by the entity controlled by Patrick Drahi resigns or is removed from the board of directors, only another director designated by the entity controlled by Patrick Drahi may fill the vacancy. The stockholders' agreement requires us to obtain the consent of Altice N.V. before we may take certain actions specified therein. 170 Table of Contents Anti-Takeover Provisions Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to be in Effect on the Closing of this Offering A special meeting of stockholders may be called by a majority of our board of directors, the chair of our board of directors, stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock or the director nominated by an entity controlled by Patrick Drahi. As described above in "Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common StockVoting Rights," our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will further provide for a tri-class common stock structure, as a result of which Altice N.V. generally will be able to control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. The foregoing provisions will make it more difficult for our existing stockholders, other than Altice N.V., to replace our board of directors as well as for another party to obtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Because our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers, these provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management. In addition, the authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change our control. Authorized but Unissued Shares The authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing standards of the . These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. Section 203 of the DGCL Section 203 of the DGCL generally prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit with any person who, together with affiliation and association, owns, or within the prior three years, did own, 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock. The prohibition continues for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an owner of 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock unless the transaction or the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The statute could prohibit or delay, defer or prevent a change in control with respect to Altice USA. However, by action of our board of directors we have waived the provisions of Section 203. Choice of Forum Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL; (iv) any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (v) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated bylaws permit our board of directors to waive the exclusive forum provision and consent to suit in other jurisdictions. 171 Table of Contents Limitations of Liability and Indemnification Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions indemnifying our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. Prior to the completion of this offering, we will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors which, in some cases, are broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained under Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. The effect of this provision is to restrict our rights and the rights of our stockholders in derivative suits to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except that a director will be personally liable for:  any breach of his or her duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;  acts or omissions not in good faith which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;  the payment of dividends or the redemption or purchase of stock in violation of Delaware law; or  any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. This provision does not affect a director's liability under the federal securities laws. To the extent our directors, officers and controlling persons are indemnified under the provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, Delaware law or contractual arrangements against liabilities arising under the Securities Act, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. Corporate Opportunities The DGCL permits corporations to adopt provisions that renounce any interest or expectancy in, or any offer of an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities that are presented to the corporation or one or more of its officers, directors or stockholders. In recognition that our directors and officers may serve as directors, officers and/or employees of Altice N.V.

Specifically, unless an opportunity arises in or is predominantly related to North America, none of the Dual Role Persons will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business that we do for the benefit of Altice N.V.

On May 20, 2016, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas acceded to the Cequel First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in its capacity as authorized representative of the holders of the Cequel 2026 Senior Secured Notes. The Cequel First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any liens on the shared collateral securing the Cequel Credit Facilities, Cequel 2023 Senior Secured Notes or Cequel 2026 Senior Secured Notes (or future first lien obligations that become subject to the Cequel First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), the liens securing all such first lien obligations shall be of equal priority.

Other Cablevision Collateralized Indebtedness Relating to Stock Monetizations CSC Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries have entered into derivative contracts to hedge their equity price risk and monetize the value of their shares of common stock of Comcast. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing CSC Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, CSC Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of March 31, 2017, CSC Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on CSC Holdings consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its principal value. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for information on how CSC Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries participate in changes in the market price of the stocks underlying these derivative contracts. All of CSC Holdings monetization transactions are obligations of CSC Holdings wholly-owned subsidiaries. CSC Holdings provides guarantees of the subsidiaries' ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event. The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar. These derivative contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. All of CSC Holdings equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in value reflected in 185 Table of Contents our consolidated statements of income, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. Cequel Derivative Instruments In June 2016, a subsidiary of Cequel entered into two fixed to floating interest rate swaps. One fixed to floating interest rate swap is converting $750,000 from a fixed rate of 1.6655% to six-month LIBOR and a second tranche of $750,000 from a fixed rate of 1.68% to six-month LIBOR. The objective of these swaps is to cover the exposure of the Cequel 2026 Senior Secured Notes to changes in the market interest rate. These swap contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap contracts are recorded through the statement of operations. Letters of Credit Certain lenders have issued standby and backstop letters of credit that are used by certain of our subsidiaries to guarantee their obligations in the ordinary course of business.

We cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock from time to time. The number of shares of our Class A common stock available for future sale into the public markets is subject to legal and contractual restrictions, some of which are described below. The expiration of these restrictions will permit sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market or could create the perception that these sales could occur, which could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of our equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that we deem acceptable. Upon the completion of this offering, we expect to have a total of shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, assuming no exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock from , and shares of our Class B common stock outstanding. All of the shares of our Class A common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for shares held by persons who may be deemed our "affiliates," as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. An "affiliate" is a person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by us or is under common control with us. The remaining outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale following the consummation of this offering. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144 or Rule 701, which are summarized below. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock at the option of the holder at any time. Rule 144 In general, pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act in effect on the date of this prospectus, once we have been subject to public company reporting requirements for at least 90 days, a person who is not one of our affiliates at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares of our Class A common stock to be sold for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, would be entitled to sell those shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with the public information requirements of Rule 144.

Rule 144 also provides that affiliates relying on Rule 144 to sell shares of our Class A common stock that are not restricted shares must nonetheless comply with the same restrictions applicable to restricted shares, other than the holding period requirement. Rule 701 Rule 701 generally allows a stockholder who purchased shares of our capital stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of our company during the immediately preceding 90 days to sell these shares in reliance upon Rule 144, but without being required to comply with the public information, holding period, volume limitation, or notice provisions of Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates of our company to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares, however, are required by that rule to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling those shares pursuant to Rule 701. Moreover, all Rule 701 shares are subject to lock-up agreements as described below and under the section titled "Underwriting" and will not become eligible for sale until the expiration of those agreements. Lock-up Agreements We and our officers, directors, and holders of substantially all of our common stock have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of our or their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of .

This summary also does not address the tax considerations arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction or under U.S. federal gift and estate tax laws, except to the limited extent set forth below. This summary is limited to persons who hold our Class A common stock as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes (within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code). In addition, because this section is a general summary, it does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances, or to certain types of stockholders that are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation, brokers or dealers in securities, insurance companies, banks or other financial institutions, hybrid entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations or accounts, persons holding Class A common stock as a part of a hedging, integrated, conversion transaction, straddle or other risk reduction transaction, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare tax on net investment income, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities, persons who acquired our Class A common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation for services, certain former U.S. citizens or long-term residents, U.S. expatriates, "controlled foreign corporations" or "passive foreign investment companies" within the meaning of the Code, and persons deemed to sell our Class A common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. If a partnership, including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares of our Class A common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partners and partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of our Class A common stock. Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty. Non-U.S. Holder Defined As used in this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of our Class A common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not any of the following for U.S. federal income tax purposes:  an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership;  an individual who is a citizen or tax resident of the United States; 189 Table of Contents  a corporation created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or  a trust (i) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and that has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. Distributions We do not anticipate making distributions on our common stock in the foreseeable future. However, if distributions of cash or property (other than certain pro rata stock distributions) are made to Non-U.S. Holders on shares of our Class A common stock, such distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent those distributions exceed both our current and our accumulated earnings and profits, they will constitute a return of capital and will first reduce a Non-U.S. Holder's basis in our Class A common stock (determined separately with respect to each share of our Class A common stock), but not below zero, and then will be treated as gain from the sale of that Class A common stock as described below under "Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock." Except as described in the next paragraph and subject to the discussion of FATCA, any dividend paid to a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax either at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividend or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. In order to receive a reduced treaty rate, the Non-U.S. Holder must provide the applicable withholding agent in a timely manner a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, whichever is applicable, or other appropriate version of IRS Form W-8, certifying qualification for the reduced rate. A Non-U.S. Holder of shares of our Class A common stock eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS in a timely manner. If the Non-U.S. Holder holds the Class A common stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on the Non-U.S. Holder's behalf, the Non-U.S. Holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent, which then will be required to provide certification to the applicable withholding agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. The withholding tax shall not apply to any dividend paid to a Non-U.S. Holder if such dividend is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such non-U.S. Holder. In order to claim this exemption, the Non-U.S. Holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed IRS Form W-8ECI or other applicable IRS Form W-8 properly certifying such exemption. Such effectively connected dividends, although not subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at applicable graduated U.S. federal income tax rates, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. In addition, dividends received by a Non-U.S. Holder that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business may also be subject to a "branch profits tax" at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. 190 Table of Contents Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock Subject to the discussion of FATCA and backup withholding, Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal income tax, including by way of withholding, on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our Class A common stock unless:  the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business, and if an applicable income tax treaty requires, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States;  the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual not entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year in which the sale or disposition occurs and certain other conditions are met;  our Class A common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest by reason of our status as a "United States real property holding corporation" (a "USRPHC") for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Non-U.S. Holder's disposition of, or the Non-U.S. Holder's holding period for, our Class A common stock. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests (within the meaning of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. We believe that we are not currently a USRPHC and, based on our business plan and anticipated operations, do not expect to become a USRPHC in the future. However USRPHC status is an inherently factual determination that involves complex legal considerations. We have not sought an IRS ruling with respect to whether we are a USRPHC and we cannot give definitive assurance regarding our non-USRPHC status. Additionally, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property interests relative to the fair market value of our other business assets, there can be no assurance that we will not become a USRPHC in the future. Even if we are or become a USRPHC, as long as our Class A common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations), such Class A common stock will not be treated as a U.S. real property interest in the hands of any Non-U.S. Holder who does not hold (actually or constructively) more than 5% of our Class A common stock at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Non-U.S. Holder's disposition of, or the Non-U.S. Holder's holding period for, our Class A common stock. Non-U.S. Holders should be aware that no prediction can be made as to whether our Class A common stock will be regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations). Non-U.S. Holders described in the first bullet above will be required to pay tax on the net gain derived from the sale under regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates, and a corporate Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet above also may be subject to the branch profits tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. Individual Non-U.S. Holders described in the second bullet above will be required to pay a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, which gain may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses for that year. U.S. Federal Estate Taxes Our Class A common stock beneficially owned or treated as beneficially owned by an individual who at the time of death is not a citizen or resident of the United States (as specifically defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes), and certain lifetime transfers of an interest in Class A common stock made by such an individual, will be included in his or her gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes and, therefore, may be subject to U.S. federal estate tax, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise. 191 Table of Contents Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Generally, we must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder, the Non-U.S. Holder's name and address, and the amount of U.S. federal income tax withheld, if any. A similar report will be sent to the Non-U.S. Holder. These information reporting requirements apply even if withholding was not required because the dividends were effectively connected to the conduct of a Non-U.S. Holder's trade or business within the United States or withholding was reduced by an applicable income tax treaty. Pursuant to applicable income tax treaties or other agreements, the IRS may make these reports available to tax authorities in the Non-U.S. Holder's country of residence. Payments of dividends on, or of proceeds from the disposition of, our Class A common stock made to Non-U.S. Holders may be subject to additional information reporting and backup withholding unless the Non-U.S. Holder establishes an exemption, for example, by properly certifying its non-U.S. status on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, whichever is applicable, or another appropriate version of IRS Form W-8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding and information reporting may apply if the applicable withholding agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that a holder claiming to be a Non-U.S. Holder is a U.S. person. U.S. information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to a payment of proceeds of a disposition of Class A common stock where the transaction is effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker. However, information reporting requirements, but not backup withholding, generally will apply to such a payment if the broker is (i) a U.S. person; or (ii) a foreign person with certain U.S. connections, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the holder is a Non-U.S. Holder and certain conditions are met or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax; rather, the U.S. federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund or credit may generally be obtained from the IRS, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding in their particular circumstances and the availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup withholding under current Treasury Regulations. FATCA Legislation commonly known as FATCA (under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code) generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends on and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our Class A common stock paid to a "foreign financial institution" (as defined under FATCA and the applicable Treasury Regulations), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding the U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or otherwise establishes an exemption. The legislation also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends on and the gross proceeds of a disposition of our Class A common stock paid to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the applicable withholding agent with a certification identifying certain substantial direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity, certifies that there are none or otherwise establishes an exemption. The withholding taxes described above will apply to any dividend payments on our Class A common stock and, after December 31, 2018, to payments of gross proceeds from dispositions of our Class A common stock. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify the requirements described in this paragraph. Prospective investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in our Class A common stock. 192 Table of Contents UNDERWRITING We and the selling stockholders are offering the shares of Class A common stock described in this prospectus through a number of underwriters. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are acting as joint book-running managers of the offering and as representatives of the underwriters. We and the selling stockholders have entered into an underwriting agreement with the underwriters. Subject to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, we and the selling stockholders have agreed to sell to the underwriters, and each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase, at the public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, the number of shares of Class A common stock listed next to its name in the following table: Name Number of shares J.P. Morgan Securities LLC Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Goldman, Sachs & Co. ​ ​ ​ Total The underwriters are committed to purchase all the shares of Class A common stock offered by us and the selling stockholders if they purchase any shares of Class A common stock. The underwriting agreement also provides that if an underwriter defaults, the purchase commitments of non-defaulting underwriters may also be increased or the offering may be terminated. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters' right to reject any order in whole or in part. The underwriters propose to offer the shares of Class A common stock directly to the public at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and to certain dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of $ per share. After the initial public offering of the shares of Class A common stock, the offering price and other selling terms may be changed by the underwriters. Sales of the shares of Class A common stock made outside of the United States may be made by affiliates of the underwriters. The underwriters have an option to buy up to additional shares of Class A common stock from to cover sales of Class A common stock by the underwriters which exceed the number of shares specified in the table above. The underwriters have 30 days from the date of this prospectus to exercise this option. If any shares of Class A common stock are purchased with this option, the underwriters will purchase shares of Class A common stock in approximately the same proportion as shown in the table above. If any additional shares of Class A common stock are purchased, the underwriters will offer the additional shares of Class A common stock on the same terms as those on which the shares of Class A common stock are being offered. The underwriting fee is equal to the public offering price per share of Class A common stock less the amount paid by the underwriters to us and the selling stockholders per share of Class A common stock. The underwriting fee is $ per share. The following table shows the per share and total underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock. Without option exercise With full option exercise Per Share $ $ Total $ $ 193 Table of Contents We estimate that the total expenses of this offering, including registration, filing and listing fees, printing fees and legal and accounting expenses, but excluding the underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ . We have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for certain FINRA-related and other expenses incurred by them in connection with this offering in an amount up to $ . A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web sites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in the offering. The underwriters may agree to allocate a number of shares of Class A common stock to underwriters and selling group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the representatives to underwriters and selling group members that may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations. We and our officers, directors, and holders of substantially all of our common stock have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of our or their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of . This agreement does not apply to any existing employee benefit plans. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale" for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions. We and the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will apply to list our Class A common stock on the under the symbol " ." In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, which involves making bids for, purchasing and selling shares of Class A common stock in the open market for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock while this offering is in progress. These stabilizing transactions may include making short sales of our Class A common stock, which involves the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares of Class A common stock than they are required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing shares of Class A common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales may be "covered" shorts, which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters' option referred to above, or may be "naked" shorts, which are short positions in excess of that amount. The underwriters may close out any covered short position either by exercising their option, in whole or in part, or by purchasing shares of Class A common stock in the open market. In making this determination, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares of Class A common stock available for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriters may purchase shares of Class A common stock through the option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our Class A common stock in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters create a naked short position, they will purchase shares of Class A common stock in the open market to cover the position. The underwriters have advised us and the selling stockholders that, pursuant to Regulation M of the Securities Act, they may also engage in other activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our Class A common stock, including the imposition of penalty bids. This means that if the representatives of the underwriters purchase Class A common stock in the open market in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales, the representatives can require the underwriters that sold those shares of Class A common stock as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them. 194 Table of Contents These activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Class A common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Class A common stock, and, as a result, the price of the Class A common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If the underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them at any time. The underwriters may carry out these transactions on , in the OTC market or otherwise. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Class A common stock. The initial public offering price was determined by negotiations among us, the selling stockholders and the representatives of the underwriters. In determining the initial public offering price, we, the selling stockholders and the representatives of the underwriters considered a number of factors including:  the information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to the representatives;  our prospects and the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;  an assessment of our management;  our prospects for future earnings;  the general condition of the securities markets at the time of this offering;  the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded common stock of generally comparable companies; and  other factors deemed relevant by the underwriters and us. Neither we, the selling stockholders nor the underwriters can assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our Class A common stock, or that our Class A common stock will trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price. The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include, amongst other things, securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, investment banking and related services (including as initial purchasers of debt securities and/or arrangers of credit facilities) for the Altice Group, including the Company and its subsidiaries, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are agents and/or lenders under the CVC Credit Facilities Agreement and the Suddenlink Credit Facilities Agreement, as applicable, each as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time. See "Description of Certain Indebtedness." If any of the underwriters or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those underwriters or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain other of those underwriters or their affiliates may hedge, and certain other of those underwriters or their affiliates are likely to hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company or its affiliates. In connection with this offering, any of the underwriters or their respective affiliates acting as investors for their own account may take up the shares and, in such capacity, may retain, purchase or sell such shares for their own accounts. The 195 Table of Contents underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

Independence In connection with Altice USA's filing for an initial public offering of its common stock, we requested our independent auditor to affirm its independence relative to the rules and regulations of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). KPMG LLP's (KPMG), our registered independent public accountants, independence evaluation procedures identified an engagement by a KPMG member firm that consisted of a service provided to an affiliate of Altice USA by a member firm of KPMG International Cooperative wherein the member firm performed a bookkeeping service, which included elements that are considered management functions under the SEC independence rules. This engagement was terminated in October, 2016. The KPMG member firm referenced above does not participate in the audit engagement and the services did not have any impact on the Company. KPMG considered whether the matters noted above impacted its objectivity and ability to exercise impartial judgment with regard to its engagement as our auditors and have concluded that there has been no impairment of KPMG's objectivity and ability to exercise impartial judgment on all matters encompassed within its audits. After taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the above matter and KPMG's determination, our audit committee also concluded that KPMG's objectivity and ability to exercise impartial judgment has not been impaired. 199 Table of Contents WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION We have filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC regarding this offering.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company was incorporated on September 14, 2015 and had no operations of its own other than the issuance of debt prior to the contribution of Cequel Corporation on June 9, 2016 by Altice N.V. The results of operations of Cequel Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been included in the results of operations of the Company for the same period as Cequel Corporation was under common control with the Company throughout 2016. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York April 10, 2017 F-2 Table of Contents ALTICE USA, INC.

F-8 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, RELATED MATTERS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company and Related Matters Altice USA, Inc. ("Altice USA" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on September 14, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, Altice USA is majority-owned by Altice N.V., a public company with limited liability ( naamloze vennootshcap ) under Dutch law ("Altice N.V."). Altice N.V. acquired Cequel Corporation ("Cequel" or "Suddenlink") on December 21, 2015 and Cequel was contributed to Altice USA on June 9, 2016. Altice USA had no operations of its own other than the issuance of debt prior to the contribution of Cequel on June 9, 2016 by Altice N.V. The results of operations of Cequel for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been included in the results of operations of Altice USA for the same period, as Cequel was under common control with Altice USA throughout 2016. Altice USA acquired Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision" or "Optimum") on June 21, 2016. In addition to the operating results of Cequel for the year ended December 31, 2016, the operating results of Altice USA include the operating results of Cablevision for the period from the date of acquisition, June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016. In addition to the operating results of Cequel and Cablevision described above, Altice USA incurred net interest expense of $419,456. For the period from inception of Altice USA through December 31, 2015, the operating results of Altice USA include $157,192 of interest expense related to the indebtedness issued to fund the acquisition of Cablevision, discussed below, and the operating results of Cequel for the 10 day period, December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015. The Company classifies its operations into two reportable segments: Optimum, which operates in the New York metropolitan area, and Suddenlink, which principally operates in markets in the south-central United States. Acquisition of Cablevision Systems Corporation On June 21, 2016 (the "Optimum Acquisition Date"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of September 16, 2015, by and among Cablevision, Altice N.V., Neptune Merger Sub Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altice N.V. ("Merger Sub"), Merger Sub merged with and into Cablevision, with Cablevision surviving the merger (the "Optimum Acquisition"). In connection with the Optimum Acquisition, each outstanding share of the Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and together with the Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock, the "Shares") other than (i) Shares owned by Cablevision, Altice N.V. or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, in each case not held on behalf of third parties in a fiduciary capacity, received $34.90 in cash without interest, less applicable tax withholdings (the "Optimum Acquisition Consideration"). Pursuant to an agreement, dated December 21, 2015, by and among CVC 2 B.V., CIE Management IX Limited, for and on behalf of the limited partnerships BC European Capital IX-1 through 11 and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, certain affiliates of BCP and CPPIB (the "Co-Investors") funded approximately $1,000,000 toward the payment of the aggregate Per Share Optimum Acquisition Consideration, and indirectly acquired approximately 30% of the Shares of Cablevision. F-9 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, RELATED MATTERS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued) Also in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition, outstanding equity-based awards granted under Cablevision's equity plans were cancelled and converted into cash based upon the $34.90 per Share Optimum Acquisition price in accordance with the original terms of the awards. The total consideration for the outstanding CNYG Class A Shares, the outstanding CNYG Class B Shares, and the equity-based awards amounted to $9,958,323. In connection with the Optimum Acquisition, in October 2015, Neptune Finco Corp. ("Finco"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Altice N.V. formed to complete the financing described herein and the merger with CSC Holdings, LLC ("CSC Holdings"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision, borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $3,800,000 under a term loan facility (the "Term Credit Facility") and entered into revolving loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (the "Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Term Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities"). Finco also issued $1,800,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.125% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes"), $2,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.875% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes"), and $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior guaranteed notes due 2025 (the "2025 Guaranteed Notes") (collectively the "Optimum Acquisition Notes"). On June 21, 2016, immediately following the Optimum Acquisition, Finco merged with and into CSC Holdings, with CSC Holdings surviving the merger (the "CSC Holdings Merger"), and the Optimum Acquisition Notes and the Credit Facilities became obligations of CSC Holdings. On June 21, 2016, in connection with the Optimum Acquisition, the Company issued notes payable to affiliates and related parties aggregating $1,750,000, of which $875,000 bear interest at 10.75% and $875,000 bear interest at 11%. Acquisition of Cequel Corporation On December 21, 2015, Altice N.V. acquired approximately 70% of the total outstanding equity interests in Cequel Corporation (the "Suddenlink Acquisition") from the direct and indirect stockholders of Cequel Corporation (the "Sellers"). The consideration for the acquired equity interests was based on a total equity valuation for 100% of the capital and voting rights of Cequel of $3,973,528 which includes $2,797,928 of cash consideration, $675,600 of retained equity held by entities affiliated with BC Partners and CPPIB and $500,000 funded by the issuance by an affiliate of Altice N.V. of a senior vendor note that was subscribed by entities affiliated with BC Partners and CPPIB. Following the closing of the Suddenlink Acquisition, entities affiliated with BC Partners and CPPIB retained indirect equity interests in Cequel representing, in the aggregate, 30% of Cequel's outstanding capital stock on a post-closing basis. In addition, the carried interest plans of the Stockholders were cashed out whereby payments were made to participants in such carried interest plans, including certain officers and directors of Cequel. In June 2016, Cequel was contributed to Altice USA. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Cequel from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the operating results of Cablevision from the Optimum Acquisition Date through December 31, 2016. F-10 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, RELATED MATTERS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued) Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 11 for a discussion of fair value estimates. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes video, high-speed data, and voice services revenues as the services are provided to customers. Revenue received from customers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is allocated to each product in a pro-rata manner based on the individual product's selling price (generally, the price at which the product is regularly sold on a standalone basis). Installation revenue for the Company's video, consumer high-speed data and VoIP services is recognized as installations are completed, as direct selling costs have exceeded this revenue in all periods reported. Advertising revenues are recognized when commercials are aired. Revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur. Multiple-Element Transactions In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into multiple-element transactions where it is simultaneously both a customer and a vendor with the same counterparty or in which it purchases multiple products and/or services, or settles outstanding items contemporaneous with the purchase of a product or service from a single counterparty. The Company's policy for accounting for each transaction negotiated contemporaneously is to record each deliverable of the transaction based on its best estimate of selling price in a manner consistent with that used to determine the price to sell each deliverable on a standalone basis. In determining the fair value of the respective deliverable, the Company will utilize quoted market prices (as available), historical transactions or comparable transactions. Gross Versus Net Revenue Recognition In the normal course of business, the Company is assessed non-income related taxes by governmental authorities, including franchising authorities (generally under multi-year agreements), and collects such taxes from its customers. The Company's policy is that, in instances where the tax is being F-11 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) assessed directly on the Company, amounts paid to the governmental authorities and amounts received from the customers are recorded on a gross basis. That is, amounts paid to the governmental authorities are recorded as programming and other direct costs and amounts received from the customer are recorded as revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the amount of franchise fees and certain other taxes and fees included as a component of revenue aggregated $154,732. Technical and Operating Expenses Costs of revenue related to sales of services are classified as "programming and other direct costs" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Programming Costs Programming expenses related to the Company's video service represent fees paid to programming distributors to license the programming distributed to subscribers. This programming is acquired generally under multi-year distribution agreements, with rates usually based on the number of subscribers that receive the programming. If there are periods when an existing distribution agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time, the Company continues to carry and pay for these services until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewals. The amount of programming expense recorded during the interim period is based on the Company's estimates of the ultimate contractual agreement expected to be reached, which is based on several factors, including previous contractual rates, customary rate increases and the current status of negotiations. Such estimates are adjusted as negotiations progress until new programming terms are finalized. In addition, the Company has received, or may receive, incentives from programming distributors for carriage of the distributors' programming. The Company generally recognizes these incentives as a reduction of programming costs in "programming and other direct costs", generally over the term of the distribution agreement. Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are charged to expense when incurred and are reflected in "other operating expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Advertising costs amounted to $135,513 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation cost relates to awards of units in a carried unit plan. For carried interest units, the Company measures share-based compensation cost at the grant date fair value and recognizes the expense over the requisite service period or when it is probable any related performance condition will be met. For carried interest units with graded vesting requirement, compensation cost is recognized on an accelerated method under the graded vesting method over the requisite service period for the carried interest unit. Carried interest units that vest entirely at the end of the vesting requirement are expensed on a straight-line basis. The Company estimates the fair value of carried interest units using an option pricing model. Key inputs that are used in applying the option pricing method are total equity value, equity volatility, risk F-12 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) free rate and time to liquidity event. The estimate of total equity value is determined using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates cash flow projections that are discounted at an appropriate rate, and the market approach, which involves applying a market multiple to the Company's projected operating results. The Company estimates volatility based on the historical equity volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies. Because there has been no public market for our equity prior to this offering, the estimates and assumptions the Company uses in the share-based compensation valuations are highly complex and subjective. Following the offering, such subjective valuations and estimates will no longer be necessary because we will rely on the market price of the Company's common stock to determine the fair value of share-based compensation awards. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our share-based compensation. Income Taxes The Company's provision for income taxes is based on current period income, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in estimates with regard to uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax assets are subject to an ongoing assessment of realizability. The Company provides deferred taxes for the outside basis difference of its investment in partnerships. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company's cash investments are placed with money market funds and financial institutions that are investment grade as rated by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. The Company selects money market funds that predominantly invest in marketable, direct obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States government or its agencies, commercial paper, fully collateralized repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, and time deposits. The Company considers the balance of its investment in funds that substantially hold securities that mature within three months or less from the date the fund purchases these securities to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents either approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments or are at fair value. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of valuation allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable by evaluating the collectability of outstanding receivables and general factors such as historical collection experience, length of time individual receivables are past due, and the economic and competitive environment. Investments Investment securities and investment securities pledged as collateral are classified as trading securities and are stated at fair value with realized and unrealized holding gains and losses included in net income. F-13 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Long-Lived Assets and Amortizable Intangible Assets Property, plant and equipment, including construction materials, are carried at cost, and include all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable systems, and the costs of new equipment installations. Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the present value of the total minimum lease payments. Depreciation on equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, with respect to equipment under capital leases and leasehold improvements, amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the assets' useful lives and reported in depreciation and amortization (including impairments) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or develop internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software and reported in depreciation and amortization (including impairments). Customer relationships, trade names and other intangibles established in connection with acquisitions that are finite-lived are amortized in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the projected net cash inflows to the Company are expected to occur, such as the sum of the years' digits method, or when such pattern does not exist, using the straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization that arose from acquisitions) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and the value of franchises, trademarks, and certain other intangibles acquired in purchase business combinations which have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, such assets are tested for impairment annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The Company assesses qualitative factors for its reporting units that carry goodwill. If the qualitative assessment results in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, then no further testing is performed for that reporting unit. When the qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit, then the impairment analysis for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill utilizing an enterprise-value based premise approach. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill which would be recognized in a business combination. F-14 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the one-step quantitative identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test. This quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a unit of accounting's fair value is less than its carrying amount. When the qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, the impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related debt. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in certain equity prices and interest rates and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges, and changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in the statement of operations as gains (losses) on derivative contracts. Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when the Company believes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires that the statement of cash flows disclose the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. Restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-18 provides specific guidance on the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance was adopted as of December 31, 2016. In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-17 (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU amends existing guidance to require the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position. ASU No. 2015-17 was adopted by the Company in the fourth quarter 2016 and was applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional F-15 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Prior to the issuance of the standard, entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. ASU No. 2015-16 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, IntangiblesGoodwill and OtherInternal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. ASU No. 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU No. 2015-05 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs from line-of-credit arrangements after adoption of ASU No. 2015-03. ASU No. 2015-15 clarifies that the Securities and Exchange Commission staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU No. 2015-03 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU No. 2014-15 was adopted by the Company for the annual period ended December 31, 2016. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period. ASU No. 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. ASU No. 2014-12 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. F-16 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU No. 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective and allows the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 that approved deferring the effective date by one year so that ASU No. 2014-09 would become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The FASB also approved, in July 2015, permitting the early adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, but not before the original effective date for the Company of January 1, 2017. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in order to clarify the Codification and to correct any unintended application of the guidance. These items are not expected to have a significant effect on the current accounting standard. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, which is not yet effective. ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective, reflecting the one-year deferral, for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (January 1, 2018 for the Company). Early adoption of the standard is permitted but not before the original effective date. Companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and selecting the method of transition to the new standard. We currently expect the adoption to impact the timing of the recognition of residential installation revenue and the recognition of commission expenses. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments which clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted and will be applied retrospectively. The Company has not yet completed the evaluation of the effect that ASU No. 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, CompensationStock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which provides simplification of income tax accounting for share-based payment awards. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value will be applied using the modified retrospective transition method. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term will be applied prospectively. The Company may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. In connection with the adoption on January 1, 2017, a deferred tax asset of approximately $309,000 for previously unrealized excess tax benefits will be recognized with the offset recorded to accumulated deficit. F-17 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a lessee's rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted and will be applied using the modified retrospective method. The Company has not yet completed the evaluation of the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07 CompensationRetirement Benefits (Topic 715). ASU No. 2017-07 requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. It also provides guidance on how to present the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the income statement and what component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization. ASU No. 2017-07 becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted and will be applied retrospectively. The Company has not yet completed the evaluation of the effect that ASU No. 2017-07 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Common Stock At December 31, 2016, the Company had 100 shares of common stock with a par value of $.01 issued and outstanding. Net Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net loss per share have been computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share excludes the effects of common stock equivalents as they are anti-dilutive. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade account receivables. The Company monitors the financial institutions and money market funds where it invests its cash and cash equivalents with diversification among counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. The Company's emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and liquidity and secondarily on maximizing the yield on its investments. Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to its cash and cash equivalents balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of the respective financial institutions. The Company did not have a single customer that represented 10% or more of its consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 10% or more of its consolidated net trade receivables at December 31, 2016. NOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATION As discussed in Note 1, the Company completed the Optimum Acquisition on June 21, 2016 and the Suddenlink Acquisition on December 21, 2015. The acquisitions were accounted for as a business combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805. Accordingly, the Company recorded the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisitions. F-18 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATION (Continued) The following table provides the preliminary allocation of the total purchase price of $9,958,323 to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Cablevision based on preliminary fair value information currently available, which is subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The table also summarizes the allocation of the total purchase price of $3,973,528 to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair value information in connection with the Suddenlink Acquisition: Cablevision Cequel Preliminary Fair Values Estimated Useful Lives Fair Values Estimated Useful Lives Current assets $ 1,923,071 $ 161,874 Accounts receivable 271,305 180,422 Property, plant and equipment 4,864,621 2 - 18 years 2,107,220 3 - 13 years Goodwill 5,838,959 2,153,741 Cable television franchise rights 8,113,575 Indefinite-lived 4,906,506 Indefinite-lived Customer relationships 4,850,000 8 to 18 years 1,075,884 8 years Trade names 1,010,000 12 years 56,782 2 years Amortizable intangible assets 23,296 1 - 15 years 3,356 11 years Other non-current assets 748,998 73,811 Current liabilities (2,305,954 ) (534,662 ) Long-term debt (8,355,386 ) (4,717,305 ) Deferred income taxes (6,834,807 ) (1,492,017 ) Other non-current liabilities (189,355 ) (2,084 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 9,958,323 $ 3,973,528 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The fair value of customer relationships and cable television franchises were valued using derivations of the "income" approach. The future expected earnings from these assets were discounted to their present value equivalent. Trade names were valued using the relief from royalty method, which is based on the present value of the royalty payments avoided as a result of the company owning the intangible asset. The basis for the valuation methods was the Company's projections. These projections were based on management's assumptions including among others, penetration rates for video, high speed data, and voice; revenue growth rates; operating margins; and capital expenditures. The assumptions are derived based on the Company's and its peers' historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the cable industry. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible asset. The value is highly dependent on the achievement of the future financial results contemplated in the projections. The estimates and assumptions made in the valuation are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would have significantly affected the value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth, programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures and the discount rate utilized. F-19 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATION (Continued) In establishing fair value for the vast majority of the acquired property, plant and equipment, the cost approach was utilized. The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation, and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. The cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. The estimates of expected useful lives take into consideration the effects of contractual relationships, customer attrition, eventual development of new technologies and market competition. Long-term debt assumed was valued using quoted market prices (Level 2). The carrying value of most other assets and liabilities approximated fair value as of the acquisition dates. As a result of applying business combination accounting, the Company recorded goodwill, which represented the excess of organization value over amounts assigned to the other identifiable tangible and intangible assets arising from expectations of future operational performance and cash generation. The following table presents the unaudited pro forma revenue, loss from continuing operations and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 as if the Optimum Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2016: Revenue $ 9,154,816 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Loss from continuing operations $ (691,606 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net loss $ (691,606 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The pro forma results presented above include the impact of additional amortization expense related to the identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with the Optimum Acquisition and additional depreciation expense related to the fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment. NOTE 4. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION During 2016, the Company's non-cash investing and financing activities and other supplemental data were as follows: Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities: Continuing Operations: Property and equipment accrued but unpaid $ 155,653 Dividend distributions declared but not paid 79,617 Notes payable to vendor 12,449 Deferred financing costs accrued but unpaid 2,570 Supplemental Data: Cash interest paid 1,092,114 Income taxes paid, net 1,538 F-20 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 5. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSE Restructuring During 2016, the Company commenced its restructuring initiatives (the "2016 Restructuring Plan") that are intended to simplify the Company's organizational structure. The 2016 Restructuring Plan resulted in charges of $215,420 associated with the elimination of positions primarily in corporate, administrative and infrastructure functions across the Optimum and Suddenlink business segments and estimated charges of $11,157 associated with facility realignment and other costs. The following table summarizes the activity for the 2016 Restructuring Plan: Severance and Other Employee Related Costs Facility Realignment and Other Costs Total Restructuring charges $ 215,420 $ 11,157 $ 226,577 Payments and other (113,301 ) (2,760 ) (116,061 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Accrual balance at December 31, 2016 $ 102,119 $ 8,397 $ 110,516 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In addition to the charges included in the table above, the Company recorded net restructuring credits of $27 relating to changes to the Company's previous estimates recorded in connection with the Company's prior restructuring plans. Other Expense The Company incurred transaction costs of $13,845 for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the Optimum Acquisition and Suddenlink Acquisition which are reflected in restructuring and other expense in the consolidated statement of operations. NOTE 6. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Costs incurred in the construction of the Company's cable systems, including line extensions to, and upgrade of, the Company's hybrid fiber/coaxial infrastructure, initial placement of the feeder cable to connect a customer that had not been previously connected, and headend facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, subcontractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of the Company's employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. These costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the plant (10 to 25 years) and headend facilities (4 to 25 years). Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Installation costs associated with the initial deployment of new customer premise equipment ("CPE") necessary to provide video, high-speed data or voice services are also capitalized. These costs include materials, subcontractor labor, internal labor, and other related costs associated with the connection activities. The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity. These installation costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the CPE necessary to provide video, high-speed data or voice services. In circumstances where CPE tracking is not available, the Company estimates the amount of capitalized installation costs based on whether or F-21 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 6. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued) not the business or residence had been previously connected to the network. These installation costs are depreciated over their estimated useful life of 4-8 years. The portion of departmental costs related to disconnecting services and removing CPE from a customer, costs related to connecting CPE that has been previously connected to the network and repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant and such lives are revised to the extent necessary due to changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively. Property, plant and equipment (including equipment under capital leases) as of December 31, 2016 consist of the following assets, which are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives shown below: Estimated Useful Lives Customer equipment $ 871,049 3 to 5 years Headends and related equipment 1,482,631 4 to 25 years Infrastructure 3,740,494 3 to 25 years Equipment and software 735,012 3 to 10 years Construction in progress (including materials and supplies) 84,321 Furniture and fixtures 45,576 5 to 12 years Transportation equipment 135,488 5 to 10 years Buildings and building improvements 390,337 10 to 40 years Leasehold improvements 104,309 Term of lease Land 47,715 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 7,636,932 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,039,297 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 6,597,635 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company capitalized certain costs aggregating $75,804, related to the acquisition and development of internal use software, which are included in the table above. Depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment (including capital leases) for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $1,046,896. At December 31, 2016, the gross amount of buildings and equipment and related accumulated amortization recorded under capital leases were as follows: Buildings and equipment $ 53,833 Less accumulated amortization (6,306 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 47,527 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ F-22 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 7. OPERATING LEASES The Company leases certain office, production, and transmission facilities under terms of leases expiring at various dates through 2035. The leases generally provide for escalating rentals over the term of the lease plus certain real estate taxes and other costs or credits. Costs associated with such operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term. The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent. In addition, the Company rents space on utility poles for its operations. The Company's pole rental agreements are for varying terms, and management anticipates renewals as they expire.

DEBT CSC Holdings Credit Facilities In connection with the Optimum Acquisition, in October 2015, Neptune Finco Corp. ("Finco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed to complete the financing described herein and the merger with CSC Holdings, borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $3,800,000 under a term loan facility (the "Term Credit Facility") and entered into revolving loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (the "Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Term Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities"). The Term Credit Facility was to mature on October 9, 2022 and the Revolving Credit Facility was to mature on October 9, 2020 (see discussion below regarding the extension amendments). In addition, on June 21, 2016 and July 21, 2016, the Company entered into incremental loan assumption agreements whereby the Revolving Credit Facility was increased by $70,000 and $35,000, respectively, to $2,105,000. Finco also issued $1,800,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.125% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes"), $2,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.875% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes"), and $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior guaranteed notes due 2025 (the "2025 Guaranteed Notes") (collectively the "Optimum Acquisition Notes"). On June 21, 2016, immediately following the Optimum Acquisition, Finco merged with and into CSC Holdings, with CSC Holdings surviving the merger (the "CSC Holdings Merger"), and the Optimum Acquisition Notes and the Credit Facilities became obligations of CSC Holdings. The 2025 Guaranteed Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by each restricted subsidiary of CSC Holdings (other than CSC TKR, LLC and its subsidiaries, which own and operate the New Jersey cable television systems, Cablevision Lightpath, Inc. and any subsidiaries of CSC Holdings that are "Excluded Subsidiaries" under the indenture governing the 2025 Guaranteed Notes) (such subsidiaries, the "Initial Guarantors") and the obligations under the Credit Facilities are (i) guaranteed on a senior basis by each Initial Guarantor and (ii) secured on a first priority basis by capital stock held by CSC Holdings and the guarantors in certain subsidiaries of CSC Holdings, subject to certain exclusions and limitations. F-24 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 9. DEBT (Continued) Altice USA used the proceeds from the Term Credit Facility and the Optimum Acquisition Notes, together with an equity contribution from Altice N.V. and its Co-Investors and existing cash at Cablevision, to (a) finance the Optimum Acquisition, (b) refinance the credit agreement, dated as of April 17, 2013 (the "Previous Credit Facility"), among CSC Holdings, certain subsidiaries of CSC Holdings and the lenders party thereto ($2,030,699 outstanding at the date of the Optimum Acquisition), (c) repay the senior secured credit agreement, dated as of October 12, 2012, among Newsday LLC, CSC Holdings, and the lenders party thereto (the "Previous Newsday Credit Facility") of $480,000, and (d) pay related fees and expenses. The Credit Facilities permit CSC Holdings to request revolving loans, swing line loans or letters of credit from the revolving lenders, swingline lenders or issuing banks, as applicable, thereunder, from time to time prior to October 9, 2020, unless the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility have been previously terminated. There is also a commitment fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility. On September 9, 2016, CSC Holdings entered into an amendment (the "Extension Amendment") to the Credit Facilities and the incremental loan assumption agreements dated June 21, 2016 and July 21, 2016 between CSC Holdings and certain lenders party thereto (the "Extending Lenders") pursuant to which each Extending Lender agreed to extend the maturity of its Term Credit Facility under the Credit Facilities to October 11, 2024 and to certain other amendments to the Credit Facilities. In October 2016, CSC Holdings used the net proceeds from the sale of $1,310,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior guaranteed notes due 2027 (the "2027 Guaranteed Notes") (after the deduction of fees and expenses) to prepay outstanding loans under the CSC Holdings Term Credit Facility that were not extended pursuant to the Extension Amendment. The total aggregate principal amount of the Term Credit Facility, after giving effect to the use of proceeds of the 2027 Guaranteed Notes, is $2,500,000 (the "Extended Term Loan"). The Extended Term Loan was effective on October 11, 2016. In connection with the prepayment of the Term Credit Facility, the Company wrote-off the deferred financing costs and the unamortized discount related to the existing term loan aggregating $102,894. Additionally, the Company recorded deferred financing costs and an original issue discount of $7,249 and $6,250, respectively, which are both being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Extended Term Loan. On December 9, 2016, the Credit Facilities were amended to increase the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from $2,105,000 to $2,300,000 and extend the maturity on $2,280,000 of this facility to November 30, 2021. The remaining $20,000 will mature on October 9, 2020. The Credit Facilities require CSC Holdings to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions and deductions, with (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions, and (ii) commencing with the first full fiscal year after the consummation of the Optimum Acquisition, a ratable share (based on the outstanding principal amount of the Extended Term Loan divided by the sum of the outstanding principal amount of all pari passu indebtedness and the Extended Term Loan) of 50% of the annual excess cash flow of CSC Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries, which will be reduced to 0% if the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of CSC Holdings is less than or equal to 4.5 to 1. Under the Term Credit Facility, CSC Holdings was required to make and made scheduled quarterly payment of $9,500 beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016. Under the F-25 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 9. DEBT (Continued) Extended Term Loan, CSC Holdings is required to make scheduled quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the Extended Term Loan, with the remaining balance scheduled to be paid on October 11, 2024, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017. The CSC Holdings Credit Facilities include negative covenants that are substantially similar to the negative covenants contained in the indentures under which the Optimum Acquisition Notes were issued (see discussion below). The Credit Facilities include one financial maintenance covenant (solely for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Facility), consisting of a maximum Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of 5.0 to 1, which will be tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter but only if on such day there are outstanding borrowings under the CSC Holdings Revolving Credit Facility (including swingline loans but excluding any cash collateralized letters of credit and undrawn letters of credit not to exceed $15,000). The CSC Holdings Credit Facilities contain customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants. In addition, the CSC Holdings Credit Facilities contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CSC Holdings and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes, make investments or loans, engage in transactions with affiliates, pay dividends, and make acquisitions and dispose of assets. If an event of default occurs, the obligations under the CSC Holdings Credit Facilities may be accelerated. CSC Holdings was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the CSC Holdings Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2016. Cequel Credit Facilities In connection with the Suddenlink Acquisition, lenders holding (a) $290,000 of loans and commitments under the revolving credit facility under the old credit facility and (b) approximately $815,400 of loans under the term loan facility under the old credit facility consented to roll over, on a cashless basis, such lenders' loans and commitments under the old credit facility into loans and commitments of the same amount under a new credit facility (the "Cequel Credit Facility") made available to a subsidiary of Cequel effective upon the consummation of the Suddenlink Acquisition (the 'Cequel Credit Agreement"). Upon the closing of the Suddenlink Acquisition, the $290,000 of loans and commitments under the revolving credit facility under the old credit facility that lenders elected to rollover into the Cequel Credit Facility, plus $60,000 of new revolving commitments from other lenders, formed a new $350,000 revolving credit facility under the Cequel Credit Facility, and all remaining commitments under the then existing $500,000 revolving credit facility under the old credit facility were terminated. The interest rate on the term loans outstanding under the Cequel Credit Facility equal the prime rate plus 2.25% or the LIBO rate plus 3.25%, with a LIBO rate floor of 1.00%, while the interest rate on the revolver loans equal the prime rate plus 2.25% or the LIBO rate plus 3.25%. The term loan facility requires quarterly repayments in annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount, which commenced on March 31, 2016, with the remainder due at maturity. There is a commitment fee of 0.5% on undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility. The debt under the Cequel Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in the capital stock of Suddenlink, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Cequel and substantially all of the present and future assets of Suddenlink and its restricted subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by the Cequel Communications Holdings II, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Cequel (the "Parent F-26 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 9. DEBT (Continued) Guarantor") as well as all of Suddenlink's existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Cequel Credit Agreement. The Cequel Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants. In addition, the Cequel Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Suddenlink and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes, make investments or loans, engage in transactions with affiliates, pay dividends, and make acquisitions and dispose of assets. The Cequel Credit Agreement also contains a maximum senior secured leverage maintenance covenant of 5.0 times EBITDA as defined in the Cequel Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Cequel Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including failure to make payments, breaches of covenants and representations, cross defaults to other indebtedness, unpaid judgments, changes of control and bankruptcy events. The lenders' commitments to fund amounts under the revolving credit facility are subject to certain customary conditions. Amendments to Cequel Credit Agreement On October 25, 2016, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Cequel entered into the First Amendment to the Cequel Credit Agreement, amending the credit agreement dated June 12, 2015, between the Company and certain lenders party thereto pursuant to which the applicable margin for the term loans outstanding under the Cequel Credit Facility was lowered by 25 basis points, the LIBO rate floor for the term loans outstanding under the Cequel Credit Facility was lowered by 25 basis points to 0.75% and the maturity date for the term loans outstanding under the Cequel Credit Facility was extended to January 15, 2025. The proceeds of $815,000 from the new term loan were used to repay the amount outstanding under the existing term loan of $809,327 and related fees and expenses. In connection with the extinguishment of the existing term loan, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4,807, representing primarily the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the term loan. In connection with the First Amendment to the Cequel Credit Agreement, the Company recorded deferred financing costs of $2,092, which are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. On December 9, 2016, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Cequel Credit Agreement which extended the maturity on the revolver to November 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2016, Cequel was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Cequel Credit Agreement.

The 2025 Senior Notes were issued by the 2025 Senior Notes Issuer, an indirect subsidiary of Altice N.V., bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum and were issued at a price of 100.00%. Interest on the 2025 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. Following the consummation of the Suddenlink Acquisition and related transactions, the 2025 Senior Notes Issuer merged into Cequel, the 2025 Senior Notes became the obligations of Cequel and Cequel Capital Corporation became the co-issuer of the 2025 Senior Notes. On June 12, 2015, Altice US Finance S.A., an indirect subsidiary of Altice N.V. issued $320,000 principal amount of the 7.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (the "Holdco Notes"), the proceeds from which were placed in escrow, to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Suddenlink Acquisition. The Holdco Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum and were issued at a price of 98.275%. Interest on the Holdco Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Holdco Notes were automatically exchanged into an equal aggregate principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes at Cequel during the second quarter of 2016. The exchange resulted in a decrease to member's equity of approximately $315,352. The Issuers have no ability to service interest or principal on the Notes, other than through any dividends or distributions received from Suddenlink. Suddenlink is restricted in certain circumstances, from paying dividends or distributions to the Issuers by the terms of the New Credit Agreement. However, the Cequel Credit Agreement permits Suddenlink to make dividends and distributions subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including pro forma compliance with a maximum senior secured leverage ratio, and that no event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would be caused by the making of such dividends or other distributions, and based on, among other things, availability under a restricted payment basket. The 2020 Notes, the 2021 Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any subsidiaries of the Original Issuers, including Suddenlink. The Cequel Indentures contain certain covenants, agreements and events of default which are customary with respect to non-investment grade debt securities, including limitations on the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase the Company's capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. Notes Payable to Affiliates On June 21, 2016, in connection with the Optimum Acquisition, the Company issued notes payable to affiliates aggregating $1,750,000, of which $875,000 bear interest at 10.75% and are due on December 20, 2023 and $875,000 bear interest at 11% and are due on December 20, 2024. The Company may redeem all or, part of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal F-32 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 9. DEBT (Continued) amount thereof plus the applicable premium, as defined in the notes agreement, and accrued and unpaid interest. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized interest expense of $102,557 related to these notes payable. Summary of Debt Maturities Total amounts payable by the Company under its various debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2016, including notes payable, collateralized indebtedness (see Note 10), and capital leases, during the next five years and thereafter, are as follows: Years Ending December 31, Cablevision Cequel Altice USA Total 2017 $ 1,719,180 $ 9,113 $  1,728,293 2018 2,103,441 8,652  2,112,093 2019 557,348 8,330  565,678 2020 526,340 1,508,213  2,034,553 2021 1,200,256 1,258,223  2,458,479 Thereafter 9,884,024 3,995,280 1,750,000 15,629,304 NOTE 10. DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND COLLATERALIZED INDEBTEDNESS Prepaid Forward Contracts The Company has entered into various transactions to limit the exposure against equity price risk on its shares of Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") common stock. The Company has monetized all of its stock holdings in Comcast through the execution of prepaid forward contracts, collateralized by an equivalent amount of the respective underlying stock. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Comcast stock with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing the Company to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The Company received cash proceeds upon execution of the prepaid forward contracts discussed above which has been reflected as collateralized indebtedness in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company separately accounts for the equity derivative component of the prepaid forward contracts. These equity derivatives have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Therefore, the net fair values of the equity derivatives have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability and the net increases or decreases in the fair value of the equity derivative component of the prepaid forward contracts are included in gain (loss) on derivative contracts in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. All of the Company's monetization transactions are obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, CSC Holdings has provided guarantees of the subsidiaries' ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). If any one of these contracts were terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date, the Company would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. F-33 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 10. DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND COLLATERALIZED INDEBTEDNESS (Continued) The Company monitors the financial institutions that are counterparties to its equity derivative contracts and it diversifies its equity derivative contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. All of the counterparties to such transactions carry investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2016. Interest Rate Swap Contracts In June 2016, the Company entered into two new fixed to floating interest rate swap contracts. One fixed to floating interest rate swap is converting $750,000 from a fixed rate of 1.6655% to six-month LIBO rate and a second tranche of $750,000 from a fixed rate of 1.68% to six-month LIBO rate. The objective of these swaps is to cover the exposure of the 2026 Senior Secured Notes to changes in the market interest rate. These swap contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap contracts are recorded through the statement of operations. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The following represents the location of the assets and liabilities associated with the Company's derivative instruments within the consolidated balance sheets: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Balance Sheet Location Fair Value at December 31, 2016 Fair Value at December 31, 2016 Prepaid forward contracts Derivative contracts, current $ 352 $ 13,158 Prepaid forward contracts Derivative contracts, long-term 10,604  Interest rate swap contracts Liabilities under derivative contracts, long-term  78,823 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 10,956 $ 91,981 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unrealized and realized losses related to Company's equity derivative contracts related to the Comcast common stock for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $53,696, are reflected in loss on equity derivative contracts, net in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a gain on investments of $141,538, representing the net increase in the fair values of all investment securities pledged as collateral. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss on interest rate swap contracts of $72,961.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND COLLATERALIZED INDEBTEDNESS (Continued) Settlements of Collateralized Indebtedness The following table summarizes the settlement of the Company's collateralized indebtedness relating to Comcast shares that were settled by delivering cash equal to the collateralized loan value, net of the value of the related equity derivative contracts. Number of shares(a) 5,337,750 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Collateralized indebtedness settled $ (143,102 ) Derivative contracts settled  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (143,102 ) Proceeds from new monetization contracts 179,388 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net cash receipt $ 36,286 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) Share amounts were adjusted for the 2 for 1 stock split in February 2017. The cash was obtained from the proceeds of new monetization contracts covering an equivalent number of Comcast shares. The terms of the new contracts allow the Company to retain upside participation in Comcast shares up to each respective contract's upside appreciation limit with downside exposure limited to the respective hedge price. In January 2017, the Company settled collateralized indebtedness relating to 5,337,750 Comcast shares (adjusted for the 2 for 1 stock split in February 2017) by delivering cash equal to the collateralized loan value obtained from the proceeds of a new monetization contract covering an equivalent number of Comcast shares. Accordingly, the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2016 reflect the reclassification of $184,286 of investment securities pledged as collateral from a current asset to a long-term asset and $150,036 of collateralized indebtedness from a current liability to a long-term liability. NOTE 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon their own market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:  Level IQuoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  Level IIQuoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.  Level IIIInstruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable. F-35 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (Continued) The following table presents for each of these hierarchy levels, the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: At December 31, 2016 (Successor) Level I Level II Level III Total Assets: Money market funds $ 100,139 $  $  $ 100,139 Investment securities pledged as collateral 1,483,030   1,483,030 Prepaid forward contracts  10,956  10,956 Liabilities: Prepaid forward contracts  13,158  13,158 Interest rate swap contracts 78,823 78,823 The Company's cash equivalents, investment securities and investment securities pledged as collateral are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The Company's derivative contracts and liabilities under derivative contracts on the Company's balance sheets are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit risk considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate: Credit Facility Debt, Collateralized Indebtedness, Senior Notes and Debentures, Senior Secured Notes, Senior Guaranteed Notes, Notes Payable to Affiliates and Notes Payable The fair values of each of the Company's debt instruments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of notes payable is based primarily on the present value of the remaining payments discounted at the borrowing cost. F-36 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (Continued) The carrying values, estimated fair values, and classification under the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial instruments, excluding those that are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are summarized as follows: December 31, 2016 Fair Value Hierarchy Carrying Amount(a) Estimated Fair Value Altice USA debt instruments: Notes payable to affiliates Level II $ 1,750,000 1,837,876 CSC Holdings debt instruments: Credit facility debt Level II 2,631,887 2,675,256 Collateralized indebtedness(b) Level II 1,286,069 1,280,048 Senior guaranteed notes Level II 2,289,494 2,416,375 Senior notes and debentures(c) Level II 6,732,816 7,731,150 Notes payable Level II 13,726 13,260 Cablevision senior notes(d) Level II 2,742,082 2,920,056 Cequel debt instruments: Cequel credit facility Level II 812,903 815,000 Senior Secured Notes Level II 1,079,869 1,152,250 Senior Notes Level II 4,663,064 5,054,775 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 24,001,910 $ 25,896,046 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) Amounts are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts. (b) The total carrying value of the collateralized debt was reduced by $9,142 to reflect its fair value on the Optimum Acquisition Date. (c) The total carrying value of the senior notes and debentures assumed in connection with the Optimum Acquisition was reduced by $39,713 to reflect the fair value of the notes on the Optimum Acquisition Date. (d) The total carrying value of the senior notes and debentures assumed in connection with the Optimum Acquisition was reduced by $13,075 to reflect the fair value of the notes on the Optimum Acquisition Date. The fair value estimates related to the Company's debt instruments presented above are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES The Company files a federal consolidated and certain state combined income tax returns with its 80% or more owned subsidiaries. In connection with the contribution of common stock of Cequel to the Company, Cequel joined the Company's federal consolidated group. Cablevision joined the Company's federal consolidated group on the Cablevision Acquisition Date. F-37 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES (Continued) Income tax benefit attributable to the Company's continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 consist of the following components: Current expense (benefit): Federal $ (981 ) State 5,310 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 4,329 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Deferred benefit: Federal (223,159 ) State (40,830 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (263,989 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Tax benefit relating to uncertain tax positions (6 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income tax benefit $ (259,666 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The income tax benefit attributable to the Company's continuing operations differs from the amount derived by applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income principally due to the effect of the following items: December 31, 2016 Federal tax benefit at statutory rate $ (381,901 ) State income taxes, net of federal impact (39,336 ) Changes in the valuation allowance 297 Changes in the state rates used to measure deferred taxes, net of federal impact 153,239 Tax benefit relating to uncertain tax positions (120 ) Non-deductible share-based compensation related to the carried unit plan 5,029 Non-deductible Optimum Acquisition transaction costs 4,457 Other non-deductible expenses 1,551 Research credit (400 ) Other, net (2,482 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income tax benefit $ (259,666 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ As described in Note 1, in June, 2016, (i) Cequel was contributed to Altice USA and (ii) Altice USA completed the Cablevision Acquisition. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2016, Cequel and Cablevision joined the federal consolidated and certain state combined income tax returns of Altice USA. As a result, the applicate tax rate used to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities of Cequel increased, resulting in a non-cash deferred income tax charge of $153,660. In the fourth quarter of 2016, ASU 2015-17 was adopted with prospective application. Accordingly, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. F-38 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES (Continued) The tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets or liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 are as follows. December 31, 2016 NOLs and tax credit carry forwards $ 971,728 Compensation and benefit plans 93,939 Partnership investments 113,473 Restructuring liability 37,393 Other liabilities 45,561 Liabilities under derivative contracts 31,529 Interest deferred for tax purposes 39,633 Other 6,615 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Deferred tax asset 1,339,871 Valuation allowance (3,125 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net deferred tax asset, noncurrent 1,336,746 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fixed assets and intangibles (9,065,635 ) Investments (187,795 ) Prepaid expenses (10,172 ) Fair value adjustment- debt and deferred finance costs (30,535 ) Other (9,424 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Deferred tax liability, noncurrent (9,303,561 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total net deferred tax liability $ (7,966,815 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The Cablevision Acquisition resulted in an ownership change under Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 382 and certain state taxing authorities whereby Cablevision's federal net operating losses ("NOLs") immediately prior to the Cablevision Acquisition of $877,975 will be subject to certain limitations. The Suddenlink Acquisition resulted in a third ownership change with regard to Cequel NOLs. Utilization of Cequel NOLs of $1,709,263 are limited under IRC Section 382. The utilization of the NOLs will be determined based on the ordering rules required by the applicable taxing jurisdiction. Since the limitation amounts accumulate for future use to the extent they are not utilized in any given year, the Company believes its loss carryforwards should become fully available to offset future taxable income. At December 31, 2016, the Company had consolidated federal NOLs of $3,078,119 expiring on various dates from 2019 through 2036. The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset related to $2,302,619 of such NOLs. A deferred tax asset has not been recorded for the remaining NOL of $775,500 as this portion relates to 'windfall' deductions on share-based awards that have not yet been realized. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017, the deferred tax asset for such windfall deductions will be recorded to accumulated deficit in the amount of approximately $309,000. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has $43,215 of federal alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards which do not expire and $18,672 of research credits, expiring in varying amounts from 2023 through 2036. F-39 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES (Continued) Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Company's future deductible temporary differences and NOLs. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statements of income. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. Pursuant to the Cablevision Acquisition and Cequel Acquisition, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that the Company will realize all of its gross deferred tax assets, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state NOLs. In the normal course of business, the Company engages in transactions in which the income tax consequences may be uncertain. The Company's income tax returns are filed based on interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Such income tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities. For financial statement purposes, the Company only recognizes tax positions that it believes are more likely than not of being sustained. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken or expected to be taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions, excluding associated deferred tax benefits and accrued interest, is as follows: Balance at January 1, 2016 $  Increase to tax position in connection with the Cablevision Acquisition 4,031 Decreases related to prior year tax positions (6 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 4,025 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ As of December 31, 2016, if all uncertain tax positions were sustained at the amounts reported or expected to be reported in the Company's tax returns, the elimination of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, net of the deferred tax impact, would decrease income tax expense by $5,185. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company changed its accounting policy on a prospective basis to present interest expense relating to uncertain tax positions as additional interest expense. In the period ended December 31, 2016, $309 of interest expense relating to uncertain tax position was recorded to interest expense. The most significant jurisdictions in which the Company is required to file income tax returns include the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and the City of New York, Texas and West Virginia. The State of New York is presently auditing income tax returns for years 2009 through 2011. Management does not believe that the resolution of the ongoing income tax examination described above will have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company. Changes in the F-40 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES (Continued) liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be recognized in the interim period in which the positions are effectively settled or there is a change in factual circumstances. NOTE 13. BENEFIT PLANS Qualified and Non-qualified Defined Benefit Plans Retirement Plans (collectively, the "Defined Benefit Plans") The Company sponsors a non-contributory qualified defined benefit cash balance retirement plan (the "Pension Plan") for the benefit of non-union employees of Cablevision, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement in Brooklyn. The Company maintains an unfunded non-contributory non-qualified defined benefit excess cash balance plan ("Excess Cash Balance Plan") covering certain current and former employees of Cablevision who participate in the Pension Plan, as well as an additional unfunded non-contributory, non-qualified defined benefit plan ("CSC Supplemental Benefit Plan") for the benefit of certain former officers and employees of Cablevision which provided that, upon retiring on or after normal retirement age, a participant receives a benefit equal to a specified percentage of the participant's average compensation, as defined. All participants were 100% vested in the CSC Supplemental Benefit Plan. The benefits related to the CSC Supplemental Plan were paid to participants in January 2017 and the plan was terminated. Cablevision's Pension Plan and the Excess Cash Balance Plan are frozen and no employee of Cablevision who was not already a participant could participate in the plans and no further annual Pay Credits (a certain percentage of employees' eligible pay) are made. Existing account balances under the plans continue to be credited with monthly interest in accordance with the terms of the plans. Plan Results for Defined Benefit Plans Summarized below is the funded status and the amounts recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheets for all of the Company's Defined Benefit Plans at December 31, 2016: Change in projected benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 403,963 Service cost  Interest cost 14,077 Actuarial gain (11,429 ) Curtailments 3,968 Benefits paid (28,062 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Projected benefit obligation at end of year 382,517 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 297,846 Actual return on plan assets, net 5,829 Employer contributions 8,505 Benefits paid (28,062 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair value of plan assets at end of year 284,118 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unfunded status at end of year $ (98,399 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ F-41 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 13. BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) The accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's Defined Benefit Plans aggregated $382,517 at December 31, 2016. The Company's net funded status relating to its Defined Benefit Plans at December 31, 2016, is as follows: Defined Benefit Plans $ (98,399 ) Less: Current portion related to nonqualified plans 14,293 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Long-term defined benefit plan obligations $ (84,106 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Components of the net periodic benefit cost, recorded in other operating expenses, for the Defined Benefit Plans for the year ended December 31, 2016, is as follows: Service cost $  Interest cost 6,946 Expected return on plan assets, net (4,022 ) Curtailment loss 231 Settlement income (reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss)(a) (154 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net periodic benefit cost $ 3,001 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) As a result of benefit payments to terminated or retired individuals exceeding the service and interest costs for the Pension Plan and the Excess Cash Balance Pension Plan during the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a non-cash settlement loss that represented the acceleration of the recognition of a portion of the previously unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Company's consolidated balance sheet relating to these plans. Plan Assumptions for Defined Benefit Plans Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost (made at the beginning of the year) and benefit obligations (made at the end of the year) for the Defined Benefit Plans are as follows: Net Periodic Benefit Cost Benefit Obligations June 21, 2016 to December 31, 2016 December 31, 2016 Discount rate(a) 3.53 % 3.81 % Rate of increase in future compensation levels  %  % Expected rate of return on plan assets (Pension Plan only) 3.97 % N/A (a) The discount rate of 3.53% for the period June 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016, represents the average of the quarterly discount rates used to remeasure the Company's projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost in connection with the recognition of settlement losses discussed above. F-42 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 13. BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) The discount rate used by the Company in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for the Cash Balance Plan and the Excess Cash Balance Plan was determined based on the expected future benefit payments for the plans and from the Towers Watson U.S. Rate Link: 40-90 Discount Rate Model. The model was developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds. The Company's expected long-term return on Pension Plan assets is based on a periodic review and modeling of the plan's asset allocation structure over a long-term horizon. Expectations of returns and risk for each asset class are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and modeling and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data, forward looking economic outlook, and economic/financial market theory. The expected long-term rate of return was chosen as a best estimate and was determined by (a) historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, and (b) projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Pension Plan Assets and Investment Policy The weighted average asset allocations of the Pension Plan at December 31, 2016 is as follows: Plan Assets Asset Class: Mutual funds 43 % Fixed income securities 55 Cash equivalents and other 2 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 100 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The Pension Plan's investment objectives reflect an overall low risk tolerance to stock market volatility. This strategy allows for the Pension Plan to invest in portfolios that would obtain a rate of return throughout economic cycles, commensurate with the investment risk and cash flow needs of the Pension Plan. The investments held in the Pension Plan are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations of the plan as they become payable. Investment allocation decisions are formally made by the Company's Benefit Committee, which takes into account investment advice provided by its external investment consultant. The investment consultant takes into account expected long-term risk, return, correlation, and other prudent investment assumptions when recommending asset classes and investment managers to the Company's Investment and Benefit Committee. The major categories of the Pension Plan assets are cash equivalents and bonds which are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Due to the Pension Plan's significant holdings in long-term government and non-government fixed income securities, the Pension Plan's assets are subjected to interest rate risk; specifically, a rising interest rate environment. Consequently, an increase in interest rates may cause a decrease to the overall liability of the Pension Plan thus creating a hedge against rising interest rates. In addition, a portion of the Pension Plan's bond portfolio is invested in foreign debt securities where there could be foreign currency risks associated with them, as well as in non-government securities which are subject to credit risk of the bond issuer defaulting on interest and/or principal payments.

BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) Investments at Estimated Fair Value The fair values of the assets of the Pension Plan at December 31, 2016 by asset class are as follows: Asset Class Level I Level II Level III Total Mutual funds $ 121,356 $  $  $ 121,356 Fixed income securities held in a portfolio: Foreign issued corporate debt  13,583  13,583 U.S. corporate debt  48,046  48,046 Government debt  4,810  4,810 U.S. Treasury securities  77,285  77,285 Asset-backed securities  14,065  14,065 Other  247  247 Cash equivalents(a) 2,593 3,089  5,682 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total(b) $ 123,949 $ 161,125 $  $ 285,074 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) A significant portion represents an investment in a short-term investment fund that invests primarily in securities of high quality and low risk. (b) Excludes cash and net payables relating to the purchase of securities that were not settled as of December 31, 2016. The fair values of mutual funds and cash equivalents were derived from quoted market prices that the Pension Plan administrator has the ability to access. The fair values of corporate and government debt, treasury securities and asset-back securities were derived from bids received from a vendor or broker not available in an active market that the Pension Plan administrator has the ability to access. Benefit Payments and Contributions for Defined Benefit Plans The following benefit payments are expected to be paid: 2017 $ 45,899 2018 28,812 2019 27,565 2020 28,399 2021 25,692 2022 - 2026 120,664 The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $12,700 to the Pension Plan in 2017. Defined Contribution Plans The Company maintains the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan, a contributory qualified defined contribution plan for the benefit of non-union employees of Cablevision. Participants can contribute a percentage of eligible annual compensation and the Company will make a matching cash contribution F-44 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 13. BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) or discretionary contribution, as defined in the plan. In addition, the Company maintains an unfunded non-qualified excess savings plan for which the Company provides a matching contribution similar to the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan. Applicable employees of the Company are eligible for an enhanced employer matching contribution, as well as a year-end employer discretionary contribution to the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan and the Cablevision Excess Savings Plan. The Company also maintains a 401(k) plan for employees of Cequel. Cequel employees that qualify for participation can contribute a percentage of eligible annual compensation and the Company will make a matching cash contribution, as defined in the plan. The cost associated with these plans (including the enhanced employer matching and discretionary contributions) was $28,501 for the year ended December 31, 2016. NOTE 14. EQUITY AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS Equity Plans In July 2016, certain employees of the Company and its affiliates received awards of units in a carried unit plan of an entity which has an ownership interest in the Company. The awards generally will vest as follows: 50% on the second anniversary of June 21, 2016 for Cablevision employees or December 21, 2015 for Cequel employees ("Base Date"), 25% on the third anniversary of the Base Date, and 25% on the fourth anniversary of the Base Date. Prior to the fourth anniversary, the Company has the right to repurchase vested awards held by employees upon their termination. For the performance-based awards, vesting occurs upon achievement or satisfaction of a specified performance condition. The Company considered the probability of achieving the established performance targets in determining the equity-based compensation with respect to these awards at the end of each reporting period. The carried unit plan has 259,442,785 units authorized for issuance, of which 147,700,000 have been issued to employees of the Company and 55,100,000 have been issued to employees of Altice N.V. and affiliated companies. The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for carried units based on the fair value of the award at grant date. An option pricing model was used which requires subjective assumptions for which changes in these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the carried units outstanding. The time to liquidity event assumption was based on management's judgment. The equity volatility assumption of 60% was estimated using the historical weekly volatility of publicly traded comparable companies. The risk-free rate of 0.74% assumed in valuing the units was based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rates for a period matching the expected time to liquidity event. The discount for lack of marketability of 20% was based on Finnerty's (2012) average-strike put option model. The weighted average grant date fair value of the outstanding units is $0.37 per share and the fair value was $1.76 per share as of December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized an expense of $14,368 related to the push down of share-based compensation related to the carried unit plan of which approximately $9,849 related to units granted to employees of the Company and $4,519 related to employees of Altice N.V. and affiliated companies allocated to the Company. Beginning on the fourth anniversary of the Base Date, the holders of carried units have an annual opportunity (a sixty day period determined by the administrator of the plan) to sell their units back to F-45 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 14. EQUITY AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS (Continued) the Company. Accordingly, the carried units are presented as temporary equity on the consolidated balance at fair value. Adjustments to fair value at each reporting period are recorded in paid in capital. NOTE 15. AFFILIATE AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments In July 2016, the Company completed the sale of a 75% interest in Newsday LLC to an employee of the Company. The Company retained the remaining 25% ownership interest. Effective July 7, 2016, the operating results of Newsday are no longer consolidated with those of the Company and the Company's 25% interest in the operating results of Newsday is recorded on the equity basis. At December 31, 2016, the Company's investment in Newsday was $3,640 and is included in investments in affiliates on our consolidated balance sheet. For the period July 8, 2016 to December 31, 2016, the Company recorded equity in net loss of Newsday of $1,132. In December 2016, the Company made an investment of $1,966 in I24NEWS, Altice N.V.'s 24/7 international news and current affairs channel, representing a 25% ownership interest, which is included in investments in affiliates on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31,2016. The 75% interest is owned by a subsidiary of Altice N.V. The operating results of I24NEWS will be recorded on an equity basis upon commencement of operations in 2017.

Other operating expenses includes advertising purchased from Newsday of $705 and IT consulting services of $182 provided by an Altice N.V. subsidiary, partially offset by a credit of $2,589 for transition services provided to Newsday. Capital expenditures The Company purchased equipment of $44,121 from Altice Management International and $1,025 from another Altice N.V. subsidiary. In addition, the Company acquired certain software development services that were capitalized from Altice Labs S.A. aggregating $740.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments Future cash payments and commitments required under arrangements pursuant to contracts entered into by the Company in the normal course of business as of December 31, 2016 are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Year 1 Years 2 - 3 Years 4 - 5 More than 5 years Off balance sheet arrangements: Purchase obligations(a) $ 7,136,605 $ 2,396,634 $ 3,307,915 $ 1,394,318 $ 37,738 Guarantees(b) 19,793 3,909 15,884   Letters of credit(c) 114,251 220 14,297 99,734  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 7,270,649 $ 2,400,763 $ 3,338,096 $ 1,494,052 $ 37,738 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) Purchase obligations primarily include contractual commitments with various programming vendors to provide video services to customers and minimum purchase obligations to purchase goods or services. Future fees payable under contracts with programming vendors are based on numerous factors, including the number of subscribers receiving the programming. Amounts reflected above related to programming agreements are based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming as of December 2016 multiplied by the per subscriber rates or the stated annual fee, as applicable, contained in the executed agreements in effect as of December 31, 2016. (b) Includes franchise and performance surety bonds primarily for the Company's cable television systems. (c) Represent letters of credit guaranteeing performance to municipalities and public utilities and payment of insurance premiums. Payments due by period for these arrangements represent the year in which the commitment expires although payments under these arrangements are required only in the event of nonperformance. The table above does not include obligations for payments required to be made under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. Many of the Company's franchise agreements and utility pole leases require the Company to remove its cable wires and other equipment upon termination of the respective agreements. The Company has concluded that the fair value of these asset retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated since the range of potential settlement dates is not determinable.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) Legal Matters Cable Operations Litigation Marchese, et al. v. Cablevision Systems Corporation and CSC Holdings, LLC: The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey by several present and former Cablevision subscribers, purportedly on behalf of a class of iO video subscribers in New Jersey, Connecticut and New York. After three versions of the complaint were dismissed without prejudice by the District Court, plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on August 22, 2011, alleging that the Company violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by allegedly tying the sale of interactive services offered as part of iO television packages to the rental and use of set-top boxes distributed by Cablevision, and violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by allegedly seeking to monopolize the distribution of Cablevision compatible set-top boxes. Plaintiffs seek unspecified treble monetary damages, attorney's fees, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. On September 23, 2011, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On January 10, 2012, the District Court issued a decision dismissing with prejudice the Section 2 monopolization claim, but allowing the Section 1 tying claim and related state common law claims to proceed. Cablevision's answer to the third amended complaint was filed on February 13, 2012. On December 7, 2015, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, which is subject to approval by the Court. On December 11, 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement, conditional certification of the settlement class, and approval of a class notice distribution plan. On March 10, 2016 the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and approved the class notice distribution plan. Class notice distribution and the claims submission process have now concluded. The Court granted final approval of the settlement on September 12, 2016, and the effective date of the settlement was October 24, 2016. The Company recorded an expense of $15,600 in connection with settlement. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has an estimated liability associated with the settlement of $6,100 representing the cost of benefits to class members that are reasonably expected to be provided and has paid out $9,500 in attorneys' fees. In re Cablevision Consumer Litigation: Following expiration of the affiliation agreements for carriage of certain Fox broadcast stations and cable networks on October 16, 2010, News Corporation terminated delivery of the programming feeds to the Company, and as a result, those stations and networks were unavailable on the Company's cable television systems. On October 30, 2010, the Company and Fox reached an agreement on new affiliation agreements for these stations and networks, and carriage was restored. Several purported class action lawsuits were subsequently filed on behalf of the Company's customers seeking recovery for the lack of Fox programming. Those lawsuits were consolidated in an action before the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and a consolidated complaint was filed in that court on February 22, 2011. Plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and consumer fraud, seeking unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees. On March 28, 2012, the Court ruled on the Company's motion to dismiss, denying the motion with regard to plaintiffs' breach of contract claim, but granting it with regard to the remaining claims, which were dismissed. On April 16, 2012, plaintiffs filed a second consolidated amended complaint, which asserts a claim only for breach of contract. The Company's answer was filed on May 2, 2012. On October 10, 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification and on December 13, 2012, a motion for partial F-49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) summary judgment. On March 31, 2014, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and denied without prejudice plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. On May 30, 2014, the Court approved the form of class notice, and on October 7, 2014, approved the class notice distribution plan. The class notice distribution has been completed, and the opt-out period expired on February 27, 2015. Expert discovery commenced on May 5, 2014, and concluded on December 8 and 28, 2015, when the Court ruled on the pending expert discovery motions. On January 26, 2016, the Court approved a schedule for filing of summary judgment motions. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on March 31, 2016. The Company filed its own summary judgment motion on June 13, 2016. The parties are actively engaged in settlement discussions although financial terms have not yet been finalized. The motions for summary judgment have been denied with leave to re-file in the event the discussions between the parties are not successful. In the period ended June 21, 2016 to December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an estimated liability associated with a potential settlement totaling $5,200. The amount ultimately paid in connection with a possible settlement could exceed the amount recorded. Patent Litigation Cablevision is named as a defendant in certain lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of the Company's businesses. In certain of these cases other industry participants are also defendants. In certain of these cases the Company expects that any potential liability would be the responsibility of the Company's equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual indemnification provisions. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is party to various lawsuits, some involving claims for substantial damages. Although the outcome of these other matters cannot be predicted and the impact of the final resolution of these other matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these other lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due.

F-53 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors Cablevision Systems Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Cablevision Systems Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity (deficiency), and cash flows for the period from January 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016, and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

("Finco"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Altice formed to complete the financing described herein and the merger with CSC Holdings, borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $3,800,000 under a term loan facility (the "Term Credit Facility") and entered into revolving loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 (the "Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Term Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities"). Finco also issued $1,800,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.125% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes"), $2,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.875% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 F-63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, RELATED MATTERS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued) Notes"), and $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior guaranteed notes due 2025 (the "2025 Guaranteed Notes") (collectively the "Merger Notes"). On June 21, 2016, immediately following the Merger, Finco merged with and into CSC Holdings, with CSC Holdings surviving the merger (the "CSC Holdings Merger"), and the Merger Notes and the Credit Facilities became obligations of CSC Holdings. The accompanying financial statements represent the operating results and cash flows of the Company for the period January 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016 (Predecessor) and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The operating results of the Company for the period June 21, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (Successor) are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements of Altice USA, Inc. Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Cablevision include the accounts of Cablevision and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Cablevision has no business operations independent of CSC Holdings, whose operating results and financial position are consolidated into Cablevision. All significant intercompany transactions and balances between Cablevision and CSC Holdings and their respective consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. See Note 12 for a discussion of fair value estimates. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements in the 2014 and 2015 financial statements to conform to the 2016 presentation. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes video, high-speed data, and voice services revenues as the services are provided to customers. Revenue received from customers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is allocated to each product in a pro-rata manner based on the individual product's selling price (generally, the price at which the product is regularly sold on a standalone basis). Installation revenue for the Company's video, consumer high-speed data and VoIP services is recognized as installations are completed, as direct selling costs have exceeded this revenue in all periods reported. Advertising revenues are recognized when commercials are aired. F-64 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur. Multiple-Element Transactions In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into multiple-element transactions where it is simultaneously both a customer and a vendor with the same counterparty or in which it purchases multiple products and/or services, or settles outstanding items contemporaneous with the purchase of a product or service from a single counterparty. The Company's policy for accounting for each transaction negotiated contemporaneously is to record each deliverable of the transaction based on its best estimate of selling price in a manner consistent with that used to determine the price to sell each deliverable on a standalone basis. In determining the fair value of the respective deliverable, the Company will utilize quoted market prices (as available), historical transactions or comparable transactions. Gross Versus Net Revenue Recognition In the normal course of business, the Company is assessed non-income related taxes by governmental authorities, including franchising authorities (generally under multi-year agreements), and collects such taxes from its customers. The Company's policy is that, in instances where the tax is being assessed directly on the Company, amounts paid to the governmental authorities and amounts received from the customers are recorded on a gross basis. That is, amounts paid to the governmental authorities are recorded as programming and other direct costs and amounts received from the customer are recorded as revenue. For the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of franchise fees and certain other taxes and fees included as a component of revenue aggregated $95,432, $199,701 and $178,630, respectively. Technical and Operating Expenses Costs of revenue related to sales of services are classified as "programming and other direct costs" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Programming Costs Programming expenses related to the Company's video service represent fees paid to programming distributors to license the programming distributed to subscribers. This programming is acquired generally under multi-year distribution agreements, with rates usually based on the number of subscribers that receive the programming. There have been periods when an existing distribution agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In substantially all these instances, the Company continues to carry and pay for these services until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewals. The amount of programming expense recorded during the interim period is based on the Company's estimates of the ultimate contractual agreement expected to be reached, which is based on several factors, including previous contractual rates, customary rate increases and the current status of negotiations. Such estimates are adjusted as negotiations progress until new programming terms are finalized. In addition, the Company has received, or may receive, incentives from programming distributors for carriage of the distributors' programming. The Company generally recognizes these incentives as a F-65 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) reduction of programming costs in "programming and other direct costs", generally over the term of the distribution agreement. Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are charged to expense when incurred and are reflected in "other operating expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Advertising costs amounted to $62,760, $160,671, and $156,228 for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the portion of share-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest. For share-based compensation awards that can be settled in cash, the Company recognizes compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the award at each reporting period. For options and performance based option awards, Cablevision recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For options not subject to performance based vesting conditions, Cablevision recognized the compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. For options subject to performance based vesting conditions, Cablevision recognized compensation expense based on the probable outcome of the performance criteria over the requisite service period for each tranche of awards. For restricted shares, Cablevision recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method based on the grant date price of CNYG Class A common stock over the vesting period. For restricted stock units granted to non-employee director which vested 100% on the date of grant, compensation expense was recognized on the date of grant based on the grant date price of CNYG Class A common stock. For performance based restricted stock units ("PSUs") which cliff vested in three years, Cablevision recognized compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the estimated number of shares of CNYG Class A common stock expected to be issued. Income Taxes The Company's provision for income taxes is based on current period income, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in estimates with regard to uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax assets are subject to an ongoing assessment of realizability. The Company provides deferred taxes for the outside basis difference of its investment in partnerships. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company changed its accounting policy on a prospective basis to present interest expense relating to uncertain tax position as additional interest expense. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company's cash investments are placed with money market funds and financial institutions that are investment grade as rated by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. The Company selects money market funds that predominantly invest in marketable, direct obligations issued or F-66 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) guaranteed by the United States government or its agencies, commercial paper, fully collateralized repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, and time deposits. The Company considers the balance of its investment in funds that substantially hold securities that mature within three months or less from the date the fund purchases these securities to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents either approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments or are at fair value. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of valuation allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable by evaluating the collectability of outstanding receivables and general factors such as historical collection experience, length of time individual receivables are past due, and the economic and competitive environment. Investments Investment securities and investment securities pledged as collateral are classified as trading securities and are stated at fair value with realized and unrealized holding gains and losses included in net income. Long-Lived Assets and Amortizable Intangible Assets Property, plant and equipment, including construction materials, are carried at cost, and include all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable systems, and the costs of new equipment installations. Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the present value of the total minimum lease payments. Depreciation on equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, with respect to equipment under capital leases and leasehold improvements, amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the assets' useful lives and reported in depreciation and amortization (including impairments) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or develop internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software and reported in depreciation and amortization (including impairments). Customer relationships, trade names and other intangibles established in connection with acquisitions that are finite-lived are amortized in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the projected net cash inflows to the Company are expected to occur, such as the sum of the years' digits method, or when such pattern does not exist, using the straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization that arose from acquisitions) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. F-67 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and the value of franchises, trademarks, and certain other intangibles acquired in purchase business combinations which have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, such assets are tested for impairment annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The Company assesses qualitative factors for its reporting units that carry goodwill. If the qualitative assessment results in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, then no further testing is performed for that reporting unit. When the qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit, then the impairment analysis for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill utilizing an enterprise-value based premise approach. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill which would be recognized in a business combination. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the one-step quantitative identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test. This quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a unit of accounting's fair value is less than its carrying amount. When the qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, the impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related debt. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in certain equity prices and interest rates and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges, and changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in the statements of income as gains (losses) on derivative contracts.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when the Company believes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-17 (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU amends existing guidance to require the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position. ASU No. 2015-17 was adopted by the Company as of June 30, 2016 and was applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Prior to the issuance of the standard, entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. ASU No. 2015-16 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, IntangiblesGoodwill and OtherInternal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. ASU No. 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU No. 2015-05 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs from line-of-credit arrangements after adoption of ASU No. 2015-03. ASU No. 2015-15 clarifies that the Securities and Exchange Commission staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU No. 2015-03 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016 representing a change in accounting principle and was applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Debt issuance costs, net for the Company of $67,119, as of December 31, 2015 were reclassified from deferred financing costs and presented as a reduction to debt in the consolidated balance sheets. F-69 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Debt issuance costs, net for the Company of $7,588 as of December 31, 2015 relating to its revolving credit facility were not impacted by the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 and are reflected as long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU No. 2014-15 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period. ASU No. 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. ASU No. 2014-12 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU No. 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective and allows the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 that approved deferring the effective date by one year so that ASU No. 2014-09 would become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The FASB also approved, in July 2015, permitting the early adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, but not before the original effective date for the Company of January 1, 2017. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in order to clarify the Codification and to correct any unintended application of the guidance. These items are not expected to have a significant effect on the current accounting standard. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, which is not yet effective. ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective, reflecting the one-year deferral, for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (January 1, 2018 for the Company). Early adoption of the standard is permitted but not before the original effective date. Companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and selecting the method of transition to the new standard. We currently expect the adoption to impact the timing of the recognition of residential installation revenue and the recognition of commission expenses. F-70 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires that the statement of cash flows disclose the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. Restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-18 provides specific guidance on the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted and will be applied retrospectively. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments which clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted and will be applied retrospectively. The Company has not yet completed the evaluation of the effect that ASU No. 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, CompensationStock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which provides simplification of income tax accounting for share-based payment awards. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value will be applied using the modified retrospective transition method. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term will be applied prospectively. The Company may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. In connection with the adoption on January 1, 2017, a deferred tax asset of approximately $309,000 for previously unrealized excess tax benefits will be recognized with the offset recorded to accumulated deficit. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a lessee's rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities. The new guidance becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted and will be applied using the modified retrospective method. The Company has not yet completed the evaluation of the effect that ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Common Stock of Cablevision Prior to the Merger, each holder of CNYG Class A common stock had one vote per share while holders of CNYG Class B common stock had ten votes per share. CNYG Class B shares could be converted to CNYG Class A common stock at anytime with a conversion ratio of one CNYG Class A common share for one CNYG Class B common share. CNYG Class A stockholders were entitled to elect 25% of Cablevision's Board of Directors. CNYG Class B stockholders had the right to elect the remaining members of Cablevision's Board of Directors. In addition, CNYG Class B stockholders were F-71 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) parties to an agreement which had the effect of causing the voting power of these CNYG Class B stockholders to be cast as a block. The following table provides details of Cablevision's shares of common stock through the Merger Date: Shares of Common Stock Outstanding Class A Common Stock Class B Common Stock Balance at December 31, 2013 213,598,590 54,137,673 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Employee and non-employee director stock transactions(a) 6,621,345  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2014 220,219,935 54,137,673 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Employee and non-employee director stock transactions(a) 2,352,275  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2015 222,572,210 54,137,673 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Employee and non-employee director stock transactions(a) (185,276 )  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at June 20, 2016 222,386,934 54,137,673 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) Primarily included issuances of common stock in connection with employee and non-employee director exercises of stock options and restricted shares granted to employees, offset by shares acquired by the Company in connection with the fulfillment of employees' statutory tax withholding obligation for applicable income and other employment taxes and forfeited employee restricted shares. Dividends Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cablevision was not permitted to declare and pay dividends or repurchase stock, in each case, without the prior written consent of Altice. In accordance with these terms, Cablevision did not declare dividends during the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016. During the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, Cablevision paid $4,066 related to restricted shares that vested in respect of dividends declared and accrued on the CNYG common stock in prior periods. F-72 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Prior to the Merger, the Board of Directors of Cablevision had declared and paid the following cash dividends to stockholders of record on both its CNYG Class A common stock and CNYG Class B common stock: Declaration Date Dividend per Share Record Date Payment Date August 6, 2015 $ 0.15 August 21, 2015 September 10, 2015 May 1, 2015 $ 0.15 May 22, 2015 June 12, 2015 February 24, 2015 $ 0.15 March 16, 2015 April 3, 2015 November 5, 2014 $ 0.15 November 21, 2014 December 12, 2014 July 29, 2014 $ 0.15 August 15, 2014 September 5, 2014 May 6, 2014 $ 0.15 May 23, 2014 June 13, 2014 February 25, 2014 $ 0.15 March 14, 2014 April 3, 2014 Cablevision paid dividends aggregating $125,170 and $160,545 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, including accrued dividends on vested restricted shares of $3,935 and $1,548, respectively. Cablevision's and CSC Holdings' indentures and CSC Holdings' credit agreement restrict the amount of dividends and distributions in respect of any equity interest that can be made. Income (Loss) Per Share Basic income per common share attributable to Cablevision stockholders was computed by dividing net income attributable to Cablevision stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per common share attributable to Cablevision stockholders reflected the dilutive effects of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. For such awards that were performance based, the diluted effect was reflected upon the achievement of the performance criteria. The following table presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculations of the basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Cablevision stockholders: Years Ended December 31, January 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016 2015 2014 Basic weighted average shares outstanding 272,035 269,388 264,623 Effect of dilution: Stock options 4,444 3,532 3,247 Restricted stock 3,720 3,419 2,833 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 280,199 276,339 270,703 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Anti-dilutive shares (options whose exercise price exceeds the average market price of Cablevision's common stock during the period and certain restricted shares) totaling approximately 1,160,000, and 1,760,000 shares, were excluded from diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the years ended 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were no anti-dilutive shares excluded from diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the period January 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016. In addition, F-73 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) approximately 1,772,000 performance based restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2015, and approximately 45,000 restricted shares for the year ended December 31, 2014, issued pursuant to the Company's former employee stock plan were also excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding as the performance criteria on these awards had not yet been satisfied for the respective period. Net income (loss) per share for Cablevision subsequent to the merger is not presented since Cablevision's common stock is no longer publicly traded. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade account receivables. The Company monitors the financial institutions and money market funds where it invests its cash and cash equivalents with diversification among counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. The Company's emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and liquidity and secondarily on maximizing the yield on its investments. Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to its cash and cash equivalents balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of the respective financial institutions.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSE Restructuring The Company recorded net restructuring charges (credits) of $2,299, $(1,649), and $2,480, for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2014 restructuring expense included a $3,280 charge relating to the elimination of certain positions at Newsday. The 2016 and 2015 restructuring expense (credit) primarily related to changes to the Company's previous estimates recorded in connection with the Company's prior restructuring plans. Subsequent to the Altice Merger, the Company commenced its restructuring initiatives (the "2016 Restructuring Plan") that are intended to simplify the Company's organizational structure. The 2016 Restructuring Plan resulted in charges of $188,847 associated with the elimination of positions primarily in corporate, administrative and infrastructure functions across the Company and estimated charges of $10,410 associated with facility realignment and other costs. Other Expense In connection with the Altice Merger, the Company incurred transaction costs of $19,924 and $17,862 for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, which are reflected in restructuring and other expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $21,272 ($12,541, net of income taxes) and primarily reflects an expense of $21,000 ($12,380, net of income taxes) related to the settlement of a legal matter relating to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, a business whose operations were previously discontinued (see Note 17). Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 amounted to $5,028 ($2,822, net of income taxes) and resulted primarily from the settlement of a contingency related to Montana property taxes related to Bresnan Cable, a business which was sold in 2013. NOTE 7. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Costs incurred in the construction of the Company's cable systems, including line extensions to, and upgrade of, the Company's hybrid fiber/coaxial infrastructure, initial placement of the feeder cable to connect a customer that had not been previously connected, and headend facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, subcontractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of the Company's employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. These costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the plant (10 to 25 years) and headend facilities (4 to 25 years). Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with initial customer installations and the additions of network equipment necessary to enable advanced services are also capitalized. Costs capitalized as part of new customer installations include materials, subcontractor costs and internal direct labor costs, including service technicians and internal overhead costs incurred to connect the customer to the plant from the time of installation scheduling through the time service is activated and functioning. The internal direct labor cost capitalized is based on a combination of the actual and estimated time to complete the installation. Overhead capitalized consists mainly of employee benefits, such as payroll taxes and health insurance, directly associated with that portion of the capitalized labor and vehicle operating costs related to capitalizable activities. New connections are amortized over the estimated useful life of 5 years for customer wiring and feeder cable to the home. The portion of departmental costs related to disconnecting services, reconnection of a customer, and repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant and such lives are revised to the extent necessary due to changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively.

At December 31, 2015, the gross amount of equipment and related accumulated amortization recorded under capital leases was as follows: December 31, 2015 Equipment $ 90,099 Less accumulated amortization (28,119 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 61,980 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NOTE 8. OPERATING LEASES The Company leases certain office, production, and transmission facilities under terms of leases expiring at various dates through 2035. The leases generally provide for escalating rentals over the term of the lease plus certain real estate taxes and other costs or credits. Costs associated with such operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term. The difference F-77 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 8. OPERATING LEASES (Continued) between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent. In addition, the Company rents space on utility poles for its operations. The Company's pole rental agreements are for varying terms, and management anticipates renewals as they expire. Rent expense, including pole rentals, for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 amounted to $41,573, $82,704 and $77,769, respectively. The minimum future annual payments for all operating leases (with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year) during the next five years and thereafter, including pole rentals from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021, are as follows: 2017 $ 57,853 2018 52,206 2019 44,908 2020 41,221 2021 38,697 Thereafter 141,063 NOTE 9.

The Company's impairment analysis as of December 31, 2014 resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $200, related to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the Newsday trademarks. Additionally, in 2014, the Company recorded impairment charges of $5,631, relating to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair values of Newsday's amortizing subscriber relationships and advertiser relationships, respectively. The decrease in fair values, which were determined based on discounted cash flows, resulted primarily from the decline in projected cash flows related to these assets. These pre-tax impairment charges are included in depreciation and amortization (including impairments). No goodwill impairments were recorded for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. NOTE 10.

Newsday LLC Credit Facility Newsday LLC ("Newsday") had a senior secured credit agreement (the "Newsday Credit Agreement"), which consisted of a $480,000 floating rate term loan. Interest under the Newsday Credit Agreement was calculated, at the election of Newsday, at either the Eurodollar rate or the base rate, plus 3.50% or 2.50%, respectively, as specified in the Newsday Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Newsday Credit Agreement were guaranteed by CSC Holdings on a senior unsecured basis and certain of its subsidiaries that own interests in Newsday on a senior secured basis. The Newsday Credit Agreement was secured by a lien on the assets of Newsday and Cablevision senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $611,455 owned by Newsday Holdings.

Issuance of Debt Securities In May 2014, CSC Holdings issued $750,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due June 1, 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of CSC Holdings' other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. CSC Holdings used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, as well as cash on hand, to make a $750,000 repayment on its outstanding Term B loan facility. In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of approximately $14,273. The indentures under which the Senior Notes and Debentures were issued contain certain covenants and agreements, including limitations on the ability of CSC Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, (ii) make investments or other restricted payments, (iii) create liens, (iv) sell assets and subsidiary stock, (v) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated debt, (vi) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (vii) enter into agreements that restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries or the repayment of intercompany loans and advances, and (viii) engage in mergers or F-81 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 10.

In connection with these repurchases, Cablevision recorded a gain from the extinguishment of debt of $934, net of fees, and a write-off of approximately $1,436 of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with these notes. Debt Transaction Subsequent to Merger In connection with the Merger, in October 2015, Finco borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $3,800,000 under the Term Credit Facility and entered into revolving loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000. The Term Credit Facility was to mature on October 9, 2022 and the Revolving Credit Facility was to mature on October 9, 2020 (see discussion below regarding the extension amendments). In addition, on June 21, 2016 and July 21, 2016, the Company entered into incremental loan assumption agreements whereby the Revolving Credit Facility was increased by $70,000 and $35,000, respectively, to $2,105,000. Finco also issued $1,800,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes, $2,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, and $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Guaranteed Notes. On June 21, 2016, immediately following the Merger, Finco merged with and into CSC Holdings, with CSC Holdings surviving the merger (the "CSC Holdings Merger"), and the Merger Notes and the Credit Facilities became obligations of CSC Holdings. The 2025 Guaranteed Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by each restricted subsidiary of CSC Holdings (other than CSC TKR, LLC and its subsidiaries, which own and operate the New Jersey cable television systems, Cablevision Lightpath, Inc. and any subsidiaries of CSC Holdings that are "Excluded Subsidiaries" under the indenture governing the 2025 Guaranteed Notes) (such subsidiaries, the "Initial Guarantors") and the obligations under the Credit Facilities are (i) guaranteed on a senior basis by each Initial Guarantor and (ii) secured on a first priority basis by capital stock held by CSC Holdings and the guarantors in certain subsidiaries of CSC Holdings, subject to certain exclusions and limitations. Altice used the proceeds from the Term Credit Facility and the Merger Notes, together with an equity contribution from Altice and its Co-Investors and existing cash at Cablevision, to (a) finance the Merger, (b) refinance the credit agreement, dated as of April 17, 2013 (the "Previous Credit Facility"), among CSC Holdings, certain subsidiaries of CSC Holdings and the lenders party thereto ($2,030,699 outstanding at Merger Date), (c) repay the senior secured credit agreement, dated as of October 12, 2012, among Newsday LLC, CSC Holdings, and the lenders party thereto (the "Previous Newsday Credit Facility") of $480,000 at Merger Debt, and (d) pay related fees and expenses. The Credit Facilities permit CSC Holdings to request revolving loans, swing line loans or letters of credit from the revolving lenders, swingline lenders or issuing banks, as applicable, thereunder, from F-82 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 10. DEBT (Continued) time to time prior to October 9, 2020, unless the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility have been previously terminated. Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing or ABR Borrowing, as applicable, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, plus the Applicable Margin, where the Applicable Margin means: in respect of revolving credit loans with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, 3.25% per annum and (ii) with respect to any ABR Loan, 2.25% per annum. On September 9, 2016, CSC Holdings entered into an amendment (the "Extension Amendment") to the Credit Facilities and the incremental loan assumption agreements dated June 21, 2016 and July 21, 2016 between CSC Holdings and certain lenders party thereto (the "Extending Lenders") pursuant to which each Extending Lender agreed to extend the maturity of its Term Credit Facility under the Credit Facilities to October 11, 2024 and to certain other amendments to the Credit Facilities. In October 2016, CSC Holdings used the net proceeds from the sale of $1,310,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior guaranteed notes due 2027 (the "2027 Guaranteed Notes") (after the deduction of fees and expenses) to prepay outstanding loans under the Term Credit Facility that were not extended pursuant to the Extension Amendment. The total aggregate principal amount of the Term Credit Facility, after giving effect to the use of proceeds of the 2027 Guaranteed Notes, is $2,500,000 (the "Extended Term Loan"). The Extended Term Loan was effective on October 11, 2016. In connection with the prepayment of the Term Credit Facility, the Company wrote-off the deferred financing costs and the unamortized discount related to the existing term loan aggregating $102,894. Additionally, the Company recorded deferred financing costs and an original issue discount of $7,249 and $6,250, respectively, which are both being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Extended Term Loan. On December 9, 2016, the Credit Facilities were amended to increase the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility from $2,105,000 to $2,300,000 and extend the maturity on $2,280,000 of this facility to November 30, 2021. The remaining $20,000 will mature on October 9, 2020. The Credit Facilities require CSC Holdings to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions and deductions, with (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions, and (ii) commencing with the first full fiscal year after the consummation of the Merger, a ratable share (based on the outstanding principal amount of the Extended Term Loan divided by the sum of the outstanding principal amount of all pari passu indebtedness and the Extended Term Loan) of 50% of the annual excess cash flow of CSC Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries, which will be reduced to 0% if the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of CSC Holdings is less than or equal to 4.5 to 1. Under the Term Credit Facility, CSC Holdings was required to make and made scheduled quarterly payment of $9,500 beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016. Under the Extended Term Loan, CSC Holdings is required to make scheduled quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the Extended Term Loan, with the remaining balance scheduled to be paid on October 11, 2024, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017. Interest will be calculated under the Extended Term Loan subject to a "floor" applicable to the Adjusted LIBO Rate of 0.75% per annum, and the Applicable Margin is (1) with respect to any ABR Loan, 2.00% per annum and (2) with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, 3.00% per annum. If the F-83 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 10. DEBT (Continued) Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Extended Term Loan is less than 0.75% for any given period, the interest rate is fixed at 3.75% per annum. The Credit Facilities include negative covenants that are substantially similar to the negative covenants contained in the indentures under which the Merger Notes were issued (see discussion below). The Credit Facilities include one financial maintenance covenant (solely for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Facility), consisting of a maximum Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of 5.0 to 1, which will be tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter but only if on such day there are outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (including swingline loans but excluding any cash collateralized letters of credit and undrawn letters of credit not to exceed $15,000). The Credit Facilities also contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the obligations under the Credit Facilities may be accelerated. Total amounts payable by the Company under its various debt obligations outstanding, including the debt transaction subsequent to the merger discussed above and including notes payable, collateralized indebtedness, and capital leases, during the periods shown below, are as follows: Years Ending December 31, 2017 $ 1,719,180 2018 2,103,441 2019 557,348 2020 526,340 2021 1,200,256 Thereafter 9,884,024 NOTE 11. DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND COLLATERALIZED INDEBTEDNESS The Company has entered into various transactions to limit the exposure against equity price risk on its shares of Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") common stock. The Company has monetized all of its stock holdings in Comcast through the execution of prepaid forward contracts, collateralized by an equivalent amount of the respective underlying stock. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Comcast stock with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing the Company to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The Company received cash proceeds upon execution of the prepaid forward contracts discussed above which has been reflected as collateralized indebtedness in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company separately accounts for the equity derivative component of the prepaid forward contracts. These equity derivatives have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Therefore, the net fair values of the equity derivatives have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability and the net increases or decreases in the fair value of the equity derivative component of the prepaid forward contracts are included in gain (loss) on derivative contracts in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND COLLATERALIZED INDEBTEDNESS (Continued) All of the Company's monetization transactions are obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, CSC Holdings has provided guarantees of the subsidiaries' ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). If any one of these contracts were terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date, the Company would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The Company monitors the financial institutions that are counterparties to its equity derivative contracts and it diversifies its equity derivative contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. The following represents the location of the assets and liabilities associated with the Company's derivative instruments within the consolidated balance sheets: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Balance Sheet Location Fair Value at December 31, 2015 Prepaid forward contracts Current derivative contracts $ 10,333 $ 2,706 Prepaid forward contracts Long-term derivative contracts 72,075  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 82,408 $ 2,706 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unrealized and realized gains (losses) related to Company's equity derivative contracts related to the Comcast common stock for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 of $(36,283), $104,927, and $(45,055), respectively, are reflected in gain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. For the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a gain (loss) on investments of $129,510, $(33,935) and $129,832, respectively, representing the net increase (decrease) in the fair values of all investment securities pledged as collateral.

The terms of the new contracts allow the Company to retain upside participation in Comcast shares up to each respective contract's upside appreciation limit with downside exposure limited to the respective hedge price. NOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon their own market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:  Level IQuoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  Level IIQuoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.  Level IIIInstruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable. F-86 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (Continued) The following table presents for each of these hierarchy levels, the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: At December 31, 2015 Level I Level II Level III Total Assets: Money market funds $ 922,765 $  $  $ 922,765 Investment securities 130   130 Investment securities pledged as collateral 1,211,982   1,211,982 Prepaid forward contracts  82,408  82,408 Liabilities: Prepaid forward contracts  2,706  2,706 The Company's cash equivalents, investment securities and investment securities pledged as collateral are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The Company's prepaid forward contracts reflected as derivative contracts and liabilities under derivative contracts on the Company's balance sheets are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit risk considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, see Note 9 for a discussion of impairment charges related to nonfinancial assets not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate: Credit Facility Debt, Collateralized Indebtedness, Senior Notes and Debentures, Senior Guaranteed Notes and Notes Payable The fair values of each of the Company's debt instruments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of notes payable is based primarily on the present value of the remaining payments discounted at the borrowing cost.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (Continued) The carrying values, estimated fair values, and classification under the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial instruments, excluding those that are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are summarized as follows: December 31, 2015 Fair Value Hierarchy Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Debt instruments: Credit facility debt Level II $ 2,514,454 $ 2,525,654 Collateralized indebtedness Level II 1,191,324 1,176,396 Senior notes and debentures Level II 5,801,011 5,756,608 Notes payable Level II 14,544 14,483 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total debt instruments $ 9,521,333 $ 9,473,141 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The fair value estimates related to the Company's debt instruments and senior notes receivable presented above are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. NOTE 13. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense attributable to the Company's continuing operations consists of the following components: January 1 to June 20, 2016 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Current expense: Federal $ 6,473 $ 4,844 $ 6,122 State 1,917 15,869 2,788 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 8,390 20,713 8,910 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Deferred (benefit) expense: Federal 93,253 97,927 135,873 State 22,897 35,469 23,906 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 116,150 133,396 159,779 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Tax (benefit) expense relating to uncertain tax positions 308 763 (52,921 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income tax expense $ 124,848 $ 154,872 $ 115,768 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income tax benefit attributable to discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $8,731 is comprised of current and deferred income tax benefit of $111 and $8,620, respectively. Income tax expense attributable to discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $2,206 is comprised of current and deferred income tax expense of $108 and $2,098, respectively. F-88 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 13. INCOME TAXES (Continued) The income tax (benefit) expense attributable to the Company's continuing operations differs from the amount derived by applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income principally due to the effect of the following items: January 1 to June 20, 2016 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Federal tax expense at statutory rate $ 100,926 $ 119,931 $ 148,803 State income taxes, net of federal impact 14,825 18,874 19,059 Changes in the valuation allowance 86 (902 ) (344 ) Changes in the state rates used to measure deferred taxes, net of federal impact  (1,006 ) (322 ) Tax expense (benefit) relating to uncertain tax positions 178 574 (52,914 ) New York tax reform  16,334 (2,050 ) Non-deductible officers' compensation 462 846 1,532 Non-deductible merger transaction costs 9,392   Other non-deductible expenses 1,337 3,099 3,697 Research credit (850 ) (2,630 ) (2,634 ) Adjustment to prior year tax expense  (515 ) (192 ) Other, net (1,508 ) 267 1,133 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income tax expense $ 124,848 $ 154,872 $ 115,768 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets or liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 are as follows.

Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits were classified as cash flows from financing activities. Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for options exercised and restricted shares issued in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to share-based compensation expense for such awards. The Company realized excess tax benefit of $82, $5,694 and $336 for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, resulting in an increase to paid-in-capital. Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Company's future deductible temporary differences and NOLs. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income and tax planning strategies to allow for the utilization of its NOLs and deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statements of income. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. At this time, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state NOLs. In the normal course of business, the Company engages in transactions in which the income tax consequences may be uncertain. The Company's income tax returns are filed based on interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Such income tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities. For financial statement purposes, the Company only recognizes tax positions that it believes are more likely than not of being sustained. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken or expected to be taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained.

INCOME TAXES (Continued) A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions, excluding associated deferred tax benefits and accrued interest, is as follows: Balance at December 31, 2014 $ 4,011 Increases related to prior year tax positions 316 Increases related to prior year tax positions (88 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 3 Settlements paid in cash (220 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2015 4,022 Increases related to prior year tax positions 3 Increases related to current year tax positions 6 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at June 20, 2016 $ 4,031 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In the second quarter of 2016, the Company changed its accounting policy on a prospective basis to present interest expense relating to uncertain tax positions as additional interest expense. During the period ended June 20, 2016 and December 31, 2015, interest expense of $209 and $314 was included in income tax expense, respectively. The most significant jurisdictions in which the Company is required to file income tax returns include the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and the City of New York. The State of New York is presently auditing income tax returns for years 2009 through 2011. Management does not believe that the resolution of the ongoing income tax examination described above will have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company. Changes in the liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be recognized in the interim period in which the positions are effectively settled or there is a change in factual circumstances. NOTE 14. BENEFIT PLANS Qualified and Non-qualified Defined Benefit Plans Cablevision Retirement Plans (collectively, the "Defined Benefit Plans") The Company sponsors a non-contributory qualified defined benefit cash balance retirement plan (the "Pension Plan") for the benefit of non-union employees other than those of Newsday, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement in Brooklyn. The Company maintains an unfunded non-contributory non-qualified defined benefit excess cash balance plan ("Excess Cash Balance Plan") covering certain current and former employees of the Company who participate in the Pension Plan, as well as an additional unfunded non-contributory, non-qualified defined benefit plan ("CSC Supplemental Benefit Plan") for the benefit of certain former officers and employees of the Company which provided that, upon retiring on or after normal retirement age, a participant receives a benefit equal to a specified percentage of the participant's average compensation, as defined. All participants were 100% vested in the CSC Supplemental Benefit Plan. The benefits related to the CSC Supplemental Plan were paid to participants in January 2017 and the plan was terminated. F-91 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 14. BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) The Company amended the Pension Plan and the Excess Cash Balance Plan to freeze participation and future benefit accruals effective December 31, 2013 for all Company employees except those covered by a collective bargaining agreement in Brooklyn. Effective April 1, 2015, participation was frozen and future benefit accruals ceased for employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement in Brooklyn. Therefore, after April 1, 2015, no employee of the Company who was not already a participant could participate in the plans and no further annual Pay Credits (a certain percentage of employees' eligible pay) were made. Existing account balances under the plans continue to be credited with monthly interest in accordance with the terms of the plans. Plan Results for Defined Benefit Plans Summarized below is the funded status and the amounts recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheets for all of the Company's Defined Benefit Plans at December 31, 2015: Change in projected benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 430,846 Service cost 344 Interest cost 15,523 Actuarial (gain) loss (14,912 ) Curtailments  Benefits paid (27,838 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Projected benefit obligation at end of year 403,963 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 303,676 Actual return (loss) on plan assets, net (3,921 ) Employer contributions 25,929 Benefits paid (27,838 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair value of plan assets at end of year 297,846 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unfunded status at end of year $ (106,117 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's Defined Benefit Plans aggregated $403,963 at December 31, 2015. The Company's net funded status relating to its Defined Benefit Plans at December 31, 2015 are as follows: Defined Benefit Plans $ (106,117 ) Less: Current portion related to nonqualified plans 6,889 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Long-term defined benefit plan obligations $ (99,228 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ F-92 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 14.

Plan Assumptions for Defined Benefit Plans Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost (made at the beginning of the year) and benefit obligations (made at the end of the year) for the Defined Benefit Plans are as follows: Weighted-Average Assumptions Net Periodic Benefit Cost Benefit Obligations December 31, 2015 January 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016 Year ended December 31, 2015 Year ended December 31, 2014 Discount rate(a) 3.76 % 3.83 % 4.24 % 3.94 % Rate of increase in future compensation levels  %  % 3.50 %  % Expected rate of return on plan assets (Pension Plan only) 3.97 % 4.03 % 4.53 % N/A (a) The discount rates of 3.76%, 3.83%, and 4.24% for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 , and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, represent the average of the quarterly discount rates used to remeasure the Company's projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost in connection with the recognition of settlement losses discussed above. The discount rate used by the Company in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for the Cash Balance Plan and the Excess Cash Balance Plan was determined based on the expected future benefit F-93 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 14. BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) payments for the plans and from the Towers Watson U.S. Rate Link: 40-90 Discount Rate Model. The model was developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds. The Company's expected long-term return on Pension Plan assets is based on a periodic review and modeling of the plan's asset allocation structure over a long-term horizon. Expectations of returns and risk for each asset class are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and modeling and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data, forward looking economic outlook, and economic/financial market theory. The expected long-term rate of return was chosen as a best estimate and was determined by (a) historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, and (b) projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Pension Plan Assets and Investment Policy The weighted average asset allocations of the Pension Plan at December 31, 2015 are as follows: Plan Assets at December 31, 2015 Asset Class: Mutual funds 39 % Fixed income securities 61 Cash equivalents and other  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 100 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The Pension Plan's investment objectives reflect an overall low risk tolerance to stock market volatility. This strategy allows for the Pension Plan to invest in portfolios that would obtain a rate of return throughout economic cycles, commensurate with the investment risk and cash flow needs of the Pension Plan. The investments held in the Pension Plan are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations of the plan as they become payable. Investment allocation decisions are formally made by the Altice USA Benefits Committee, which takes into account investment advice provided by its external investment consultant. The investment consultant takes into account expected long-term risk, return, correlation, and other prudent investment assumptions when recommending asset classes and investment managers to the Company's Investment and Benefit Committee. The major categories of the Pension Plan assets are cash equivalents and bonds which are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Due to the Pension Plan's significant holdings in long-term government and non-government fixed income securities, the Pension Plan's assets are subjected to interest rate risk; specifically, a rising interest rate environment. Consequently, an increase in interest rates may cause a decrease to the overall liability of the Pension Plan thus creating a hedge against rising interest rates. In addition, a portion of the Pension Plan's bond portfolio is invested in foreign debt securities where there could be foreign currency risks associated with them, as well as in non-government securities which are subject to credit risk of the bond issuer defaulting on interest and/or principal payments.

BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) Investments at Estimated Fair Value The fair values of the assets of the Pension Plan at December 31, 2015 by asset class are as follows: Asset Class Level I Level II Level III Total Mutual funds $ 117,174 $  $  $ 117,174 Fixed income securities held in a portfolio: Foreign issued corporate debt  12,825  12,825 U.S. corporate debt  54,005  54,005 Government debt  8,273  8,273 U.S. Treasury securities  90,414  90,414 Asset-backed securities  18,563  18,563 Cash equivalents(a) 893   893 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total(b) $ 118,067 $ 184,080 $  $ 302,147 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) Represents an investment in a money market fund. (b) Excludes cash and net payables relating to the sale of securities that were not settled as of December 31, 2015. The fair values of mutual funds and cash equivalents were derived from quoted market prices that the Pension Plan administrator has the ability to access. The fair values of corporate and government debt, treasury securities and asset-back securities were derived from bids received from a vendor or broker not available in an active market that the Pension Plan administrator has the ability to access. Defined Contribution Plans The Company also maintains the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan, a contributory qualified defined contribution plan for the benefit of non-union employees of the Company. Employees can contribute a percentage of eligible annual compensation and the Company will make a matching cash contribution or discretionary contribution, as defined in the plan. In addition, the Company maintains an unfunded non-qualified excess savings plan for which the Company provides a matching contribution similar to the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan. Applicable employees of the Company are eligible for an enhanced employer matching contribution, as well as a year-end employer discretionary contribution to the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan and the Cablevision Excess Savings Plan. The cost associated with these plans (including the enhanced employer matching and discretionary contributions) was $26,964, $61,343 and $65,725 for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

EQUITY AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS Equity Plans In connection with the Merger, outstanding equity-based awards granted under the Company's equity plans were cancelled and converted into a right to receive cash based upon the $34.90 per Share merger price in accordance with the original terms of the awards. On the Merger Date, the Company had 11,880,700 stock options, 3,769,485 restricted shares, 1,724,940 restricted stock units issued to employees and 466,283 restricted stock units issued to non-employee directors outstanding. The aggregate payment was $439,167 and represents a portion of the merger consideration. Approximately $63,484 of compensation costs related to the acceleration of the vesting of these awards in connection with the Merger and the related employer payroll taxes of $7,929 were recorded on the black line and therefore are not reflected in either the Predecessor or Successor periods. In March 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Cablevision Systems Corporation 2015 Employee Stock Plan ("2015 Plan"), which was approved by Cablevision's stockholders at its annual stockholders meeting on May 21, 2015. Under the 2015 Plan, the Company was authorized to grant stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other equity-based awards. As of December 31, 2015, 79,780 equity based awards had been granted under the 2015 Plan. The Company also had an employee stock plan ("2006 Plan") under which it was authorized to grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other equity-based awards and a 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, whereby the Company was authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units and other equity-based awards. In 2015 and 2014, the Company granted its non-employee directors an aggregate of 73,056 and 66,421 restricted stock units, respectively. Total non-employee director restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2015 were 466,283. Since share-based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, such compensation expense was reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures were estimated based primarily on historical experience. The following table presents the share-based compensation expense recognized by the Company as other operating expenses: January 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016 Year ended December 31, 2015 Year ended December 31, 2014 Stock options $ 3,848 $ 9,159 $ 7,573 Restricted shares and restricted stock units 20,930 51,162 36,411 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Share-based compensation related to equity classified awards 24,778 60,321 43,984 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other share-based compensation 453 4,965  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total share-based compensation $ 25,231 $ 65,286 $ 43,984 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ An income tax benefit of $10,357, $26,718 and $17,801 was recognized in continuing operations resulting from share-based compensation expense for the period from January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016 and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Valuation AssumptionsStock Options The Company calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant. The Company's computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share-based awards and vesting schedules, or by using the simplified method (the average of the vesting period and option term), if applicable. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option was based on interest yields for U.S. Treasury instruments in effect at the time of grant. The Company's computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility of its common stock. The following assumptions were used to calculate the fair values of stock option awards granted in the first quarter of 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Risk-free interest rate 1.82 % 2.12 % Expected life (in years) 8 6.5 Dividend yield 3.63 % 3.79 % Volatility 39.98 % 42.80 % Grant date fair value $ 5.45 $ 5.27 Share-Based Payment Award Activity The following table summarizes activity relating to Company employees who held Cablevision stock options for the period January 1, 2016 to June 20, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015: Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Shares Under Option Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Time Vesting Options Performance Based Vesting Options Aggregate Intrinsic Value(a) Balance, December 31, 2014 5,097,666 7,633,500 $ 14.41 7.17 $ 79,347 Granted 2,000,000  19.17 Exercised (353,666 ) (1,024,283 ) 12.84 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance, December 31, 2015 6,744,000 6,609,217 15.28 6.80 221,900 Exercised (744,000 ) (728,517 ) 13.97 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance, June 20, 2016 6,000,000 5,880,700 $ 15.45 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between (i) the exercise price of the underlying award and (ii) the quoted price of CNYG Class A common stock on December 31, 2015, as indicated.

If the minimum performance threshold was not met, no shares were issued. Accrued dividends were paid to the extent that a PSU vested and the related stock was issued. During the first quarter of 2016, 2,992,463 Cablevision restricted shares issued to employees of the Company vested. To fulfill the employees' statutory minimum tax withholding obligations for the applicable income and other employment taxes, 1,248,875 of these shares, with an aggregate value of $41,469, were surrendered to the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 2,337,963 Cablevision restricted shares issued to employees of the Company vested. To fulfill the employees' statutory minimum tax withholding obligations for the applicable income and other employment taxes, 1,004,950 of these shares, with an aggregate value of $19,141 were surrendered to the Company. These acquired shares had been classified as treasury stock. Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards In March 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Cablevision Systems Corporation 2011 Cash Incentive Plan, which was approved by the Company's stockholders at its annual stockholders meeting in May 2011. The Company recorded expenses of $9,169, $27,170 and $43,892 for the period January 1, 2016 through June 20, 2016, and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to this plan. Carried Unit Plan Subsequent to the merger, in July 2016, certain employees of the Company and its affiliates received awards of units in a Carry Unit Plan of an entity which has an ownership interest in the F-98 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 15. EQUITY AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS (Continued) Company's parent, Neptune Holding. The awards generally will vest as follows: 50% on the second anniversary of June 21, 2016 ("Base Date"), 25% on the third anniversary of the Base Date, and 25% on the fourth anniversary of the Base Date. Prior to the fourth anniversary, the Company has the right to repurchase vested awards held by employees upon their termination. The Carry Unit Plan has 259,442,785 units authorized for issuance, of which 102,500,000 have been issued to employees of the Company and 100,300,000 have been issued to employees of Altice and affiliated companies. NOTE 16. AFFILIATE AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method Investments In September 2015, the Company purchased the minority interest in Newsday Holdings LLC ("Newsday Holdings") held by Tribune Media Company ("Tribune") for approximately $8,300. As a result of this transaction, Newsday Holdings became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition, the indemnity provided by the Company to Tribune for certain taxes incurred by Tribune if Newsday Holdings or its subsidiary sold or otherwise disposed of Newsday assets in a taxable transaction or failed to maintain specified minimum outstanding indebtedness, was amended so that the restriction period lapsed on September 2, 2015. Subsequent to the Merger, in July 2016, the Company completed the sale of a 75% interest in Newsday LLC. The Company retained the remaining 25% ownership interest. In December 2016, the Company made an investment of $1,966 in I24NEWS, Altice's 24/7 international news and current affairs channel, representing a 25% ownership interest and the 75% interest is owned by a subsidiary of Altice. Related Party Transactions As the transactions discussed below were conducted between subsidiaries under common control, amounts charged for certain services may not have represented amounts that might have been received or incurred if the transactions were based upon arm's length negotiations. Cablevision is controlled by Charles F. Dolan, certain members of his immediate family and certain family related entities (collectively the "Dolan Family"). Members of the Dolan Family are also the controlling stockholders of AMC Networks, The Madison Square Garden Company and MSG Networks Inc. ("MSG Networks").

The Company and its subsidiaries, together with AMC Networks, Madison Square Garden and MSG Networks may have entered into agreements with third parties in which the amounts paid/received by AMC Networks, Madison Square Garden and MSG Networks, their subsidiaries, or the Company may have differed from the amounts that would have been paid/received if such arrangements were negotiated separately. Where subsidiaries of the Company have incurred a cost incremental to fair value and AMC Networks, Madison Square Garden and MSG Networks have received a benefit incremental to fair value from these negotiations, the Company and its subsidiaries charged AMC Networks, Madison Square Garden and MSG Networks for the incremental amount. Programming and other direct costs Programming and other direct costs included costs incurred by the Company for the carriage of the MSG Networks and Fuse program services (2014 period only), as well as for AMC, WE tv, IFC, Sundance Channel and BBC America (2015 period only) on the Company's cable systems. The Company also purchased certain programming signal transmission and production services from AMC Networks. Other operating expenses (credits) The Company, AMC Networks, Madison Square Garden and MSG Networks routinely entered into transactions with each other in the ordinary course of business. Such transactions included, but were not limited to, sponsorship agreements and cross-promotion arrangements. Additionally, amounts reflected in the tables were net of allocations to AMC Networks, Madison Square Garden and MSG Networks for services performed by the Company on their behalf. Amounts also included charges to the Company for services performed or paid by the affiliate on the Company's behalf.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal Matters Cable Operations Litigation Marchese, et al. v. Cablevision Systems Corporation and CSC Holdings, LLC: The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey by several present and former Cablevision subscribers, purportedly on behalf of a class of iO video subscribers in New Jersey, Connecticut and New York. After three versions of the complaint were dismissed without prejudice by the District Court, plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on August 22, 2011, alleging that the Company violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by allegedly tying the sale of interactive services offered as part of iO television packages to the rental and use of set-top boxes distributed by Cablevision, and violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by allegedly seeking to monopolize the distribution of Cablevision compatible set-top boxes. Plaintiffs seek unspecified treble monetary damages, attorney's fees, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. On September 23, 2011, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On January 10, 2012, the District Court issued a decision dismissing with prejudice the Section 2 monopolization claim, but allowing the Section 1 tying claim and related state common law claims to proceed. Cablevision's answer to the third amended complaint was filed on February 13, 2012. On December 7, 2015, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, which is subject to approval by the Court. On December 11, 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement, conditional certification of the settlement class, and approval of a class notice distribution plan. On March 10, 2016 the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and approved the class notice distribution plan. Subsequent to the Merger, the class notice distribution and the claims submission process have now concluded. The Court granted final approval of the settlement on September 12, 2016 in the amount of $15,600, and the effective date of the settlement was October 24, 2016. F-101 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) In re Cablevision Consumer Litigation: Following expiration of the affiliation agreements for carriage of certain Fox broadcast stations and cable networks on October 16, 2010, News Corporation terminated delivery of the programming feeds to the Company, and as a result, those stations and networks were unavailable on the Company's cable television systems. On October 30, 2010, the Company and Fox reached an agreement on new affiliation agreements for these stations and networks, and carriage was restored. Several purported class action lawsuits were subsequently filed on behalf of the Company's customers seeking recovery for the lack of Fox programming. Those lawsuits were consolidated in an action before the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and a consolidated complaint was filed in that court on February 22, 2011. Plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and consumer fraud, seeking unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees. On March 28, 2012, the Court ruled on the Company's motion to dismiss, denying the motion with regard to plaintiffs' breach of contract claim, but granting it with regard to the remaining claims, which were dismissed. On April 16, 2012, plaintiffs filed a second consolidated amended complaint, which asserts a claim only for breach of contract. The Company's answer was filed on May 2, 2012. On October 10, 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification and on December 13, 2012, a motion for partial summary judgment. On March 31, 2014, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and denied without prejudice plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. On May 30, 2014, the Court approved the form of class notice, and on October 7, 2014, approved the class notice distribution plan. The class notice distribution has been completed, and the opt-out period expired on February 27, 2015. Expert discovery commenced on May 5, 2014, and concluded on December 8 and 28, 2015, when the Court ruled on the pending expert discovery motions. On January 26, 2016, the Court approved a schedule for filing of summary judgment motions. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on March 31, 2016. The Company filed its own summary judgment motion on June 13, 2016. The parties are actively engaged in settlement discussions although financial terms have not yet been finalized. Patent Litigation Cablevision is named as a defendant in certain lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of the Company's businesses. In certain of these cases other industry participants are also defendants. In certain of these cases the Company expects that any potential liability would be the responsibility of the Company's equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual indemnification provisions. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is party to various lawsuits, some involving claims for substantial damages. Although the outcome of these other matters cannot be predicted and the impact of the final resolution of these other matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these other lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) Other Litigation In April 2011, Thomas C. Dolan, a director and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Development, in the Office of the Chairman at Cablevision, filed a lawsuit against Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings LLC (which was subsequently dismissed as a party) in New York State Supreme Court. The lawsuit raised compensation-related claims related to events largely from 2005 to 2008. The matter was handled under the direction of an independent committee of the Board of Directors of Cablevision. In April 2015, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff on liability, with damages to be determined. On June 18, 2015, the Company filed a notice of appeal. On February 8, 2016, Cablevision and Thomas C. Dolan entered into a settlement pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay plaintiff $21,000 and plaintiff released all claims. A stipulation of dismissal with prejudice was approved and entered by the Court on February 8, 2016, and payment was made the same day. The appeal has also been withdrawn. The Company recorded an expense of $21,000 which is reflected in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 (see Note 6).

BUSINESS COMBINATION (Continued) and intangible assets and liabilities of Cablevision based on preliminary fair value information currently available, which is subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Estimates of Fair Values (As of December 31, 2016) Estimated Useful Lives Current assets $ 1,923,071 Accounts receivable 271,305 Property, plant and equipment 4,864,621 2 - 18 years Goodwill 5,838,959 Indefinite-lived cable television franchises 8,113,575 Indefinite-lived Customer relationships 4,850,000 8 to 18 years Trade names 1,010,000 12 years Amortizable intangible assets 23,296 1 - 15 years Other non-current assets 748,998 Current liabilities (2,305,954 ) Long-term debt (8,355,386 ) Deferred income taxes. (6,834,807 ) Other non-current liabilities (189,355 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 9,958,323 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The fair value of identified intangible assets was estimated using derivations of the "income" approach. Customer relationships and cable television franchises were valued using the multiple period excess earnings method ("MPEEM") approach. The MPEEM approach quantifies the expected earnings of an asset by isolating earnings attributable to the asset from the overall business enterprise earnings and then removing a charge for those assets that contribute to the generation of the isolated earnings. The future expected earnings are discounted to their present value equivalent. Trade names were valued using the relief from royalty method, which is based on the present value of the royalty payments avoided as a result of the company owning the intangible asset. The basis for the valuation methods was the Company's projections. These projections were based on management's assumptions including among others, penetration rates for video, high speed data, and voice; revenue growth rates; operating margins; and capital expenditures. The assumptions are derived based on the Company's and its peers' historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the cable industry. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible asset. The value is highly dependent on the achievement of the future financial results contemplated in the projections. The estimates and assumptions made in the valuation are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would have significantly affected the value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth, programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures and the discount rate utilized. F-105 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 19. BUSINESS COMBINATION (Continued) In establishing fair value for the vast majority of the Company's property, plant and equipment, the cost approach was utilized. The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation, and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. The cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. The estimates of expected useful lives take into consideration the effects of contractual relationships, customer attrition, eventual development of new technologies and market competition. As a result of applying business combination accounting, the Company recorded goodwill, which represented the excess of organization value over amounts assigned to the other identifiable tangible and intangible assets arising from expectations of future operational performance and cash generation. The following table sets forth the estimated amortization expense on the intangible assets recorded in the connection with the Merger for the years ending December 31: Estimated amortization expense Year Ending December 31, 2017 $ 701,908 Year Ending December 31, 2018 655,409 Year Ending December 31, 2019 609,245 Year Ending December 31, 2020 562,613 Year Ending December 31, 2021 515,430 The unaudited pro forma revenue, loss from continuing operations and net loss for the years ended December 31, 2015, as if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2015, are as follows: Revenue $ 6,545,545 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Loss from continuing operations $ (740,115 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net loss $ (752,656 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The pro forma results presented above include the impact of additional interest expense related to the debt issued to finance the Merger. The pro forma results also reflect additional amortization expense related to the identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with the Merger and additional depreciation expense related to the fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment.

Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Organization Cequel Corporation, a Delaware Corporation ("Cequel Corporation"), through its subsidiaries (together, the "Company") is a leading owner, operator and acquirer of broadband communication systems serving a diversified mix of markets. Cequel Communications Holdings I, LLC ("Cequel") is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cequel Communications Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Cequel Holdings"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cequel Corporation. Cequel Capital Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cequel (and together with Cequel, the "Issuers"). Cequel Communications, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, doing business as Suddenlink Communications ("Suddenlink"), is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cequel. The Issuers are holding companies and conduct no operations. Accordingly, the Issuers depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries in order to make payments on, or repay or refinance, the Notes, as defined herein. The terms of the Credit Agreement generally restrict Suddenlink and its restricted subsidiaries from making dividends and other distributions to the Issuers subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including pro forma compliance with maximum senior secured leverage ratio, and that no event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would be caused by the making of such dividends or other distributions, and based on, among other things, availability under a restricted payment basket. However, the Credit Agreement permits Suddenlink to make dividends and distributions to Cequel for payment of regularly scheduled interest payments through maturity on indebtedness which was incurred by Cequel to refinance the Issuers' 8.625% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"). The Issuers' 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes"), the Issuers' 5.125% Senior Notes due 2021, issued on May 16, 2013 (the "Initial 2021 Notes") and the Issuers' 5.125% Senior Notes due 2021, issued on September 9, 2014 (the "2021 Mirror Notes,") and the 2025 Senior Notes, as defined herein (collectively the 2020 Notes, the 2021 Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes, the "Senior Notes"), are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any subsidiaries of the Issuers, including Suddenlink. On December 21, 2015, Altice N.V., a public company with limited liability ( naamloze vennootshcap ) under Dutch law ("Altice"), as successor in interest to Altice S.A., certain other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Altice (the "Purchasers"), acquired approximately 70% of the total outstanding equity interests in Cequel Corporation (the "Altice Acquisition") from the direct and indirect stockholders of Cequel Corporation (the "Sellers"). Prior to the date hereof, Cequel Corporation was directly or indirectly owned by investment funds advised by BC Partners Limited ("BCP"), CPPIB-Suddenlink LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB" and together with BCP, the "Sponsors"), and IW4MK Carry Partnership LP (the "Management Holder" and together with the Sponsors, the "Stockholders"). The consideration for the acquired equity interests was based on a total equity valuation for 100% of the capital and voting rights of Cequel Corporation of $4,132.0 million, which includes $2,956.4 million of cash consideration, $675.6 million of retained equity held by the Sponsors and $500 million funded by the issuance by an affiliate of Altice of a senior vendor note that is subscribed by the Sponsors. Following the closing of the Altice Acquisition, the Sponsors retained equity interests in Cequel Corporation representing, in the aggregate, 30% of Cequel Corporation's outstanding capital stock on a post-closing basis. In addition, the carry interest plans of the Stockholders were cashed out based on an agreement between F-113 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 1. Organization (Continued) the Sponsors and the Management Holder whereby payments were made to participants in such carry interest plans, including certain officers and directors of Cequel and Cequel Corporation. 2. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has significant indebtedness and incurred net losses of $17.6 million and $214.9 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, respectively, and generated net income of $17.2 million for the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014. The Company's net cash flows used in operating activities were $17.0 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, and net cash flows provided by operating activities were $661.8 million and $686.3 million for the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015 and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. The Company requires significant cash to fund debt service requirements, capital expenditures and ongoing operations. The Company also has negative working capital, which is primarily due to the payment terms it has with its vendors. The Company has historically funded these requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under its $2.7 billion credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), sales of assets, issuances of debt, and cash on hand. However, the mix of funding sources changes from period to period. For the combined year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated $627.5 million of cash flows from operating activities after paying cash interest of $260.3 million. In addition, the Company used $478.4 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company generated $686.3 million of cash flows from operating activities after paying cash interest of $232.2 million. In addition, the Company used $420.6 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company expects that cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and available credit under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet its cash flow needs in 2016. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. However, in the opinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, which consist of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the results of the periods presented. Certain estimates and assumption have been made that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The financial information set forth in this report, unless otherwise set forth or as the context otherwise indicates, includes the accounts of Cequel and its subsidiaries for the period from December 21, 2015 to December 31, 2015 ("Successor"), and of Cequel and its subsidiaries for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015 ("Predecessor"). Effective December 21, 2015, the Company applied business combination accounting which requires certain assets and liabilities to be reflected at fair value. For a summary of the application and valuation of business combination accounting, see Footnote 4. Revenue Recognition Revenue by service offering consisted of the following: Successor Period from December 21, 2015 to December 31, 2015 Predecessor Period from January 1, 2015 to December 20, 2015 Predecessor Year Ended December 31, 2014 Video $ 33,690 $ 1,107,718 $ 1,163,892 High-speed Internet 27,789 845,514 748,842 Telephone 6,209 201,377 204,693 Advertising sales 2,079 85,587 101,197 Other 3,176 107,173 112,073 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total revenues $ 72,943 $ 2,347,369 $ 2,330,697 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Video revenue includes subscriber fees received from residential and commercial customers for the Company's various tiers or packages of video programming services, related equipment and rental charges, fees collected on behalf of local franchising authorities and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as revenue from the sale of premium networks, transactional VOD (e.g., events and movies) and digital video recorder service. High-speed Internet revenue includes subscriber fees received from residential and commercial customers for the Company's high-speed Internet services and related equipment rental charges, and wholesale transport revenue, including amounts generated by the sale of point-to-point transport services offered to wireless telephone providers (i.e. cell tower backhaul) and other carriers. Telephone revenue includes subscriber fees received from residential and commercial customers for the Company's telephone services, as well as fees collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Advertising sales includes revenue generated from the sale of advertising time to national, regional and local customers. Other revenue includes revenue from the Company's security services, installation charges, revenue from tower services, including site development and construction, and other residential and commercial subscriber-related fees. Revenue from video, high-speed Internet, telephone and security services are recognized in the period during which the related services are provided. Revenue received from customers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is allocated to each product in a pro-rata manner based on the individual product's selling price (generally, the price at which the product is regularly sold on a standalone basis). Installation revenue is recognized in the period the service is performed to the extent F-115 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) of direct selling costs, with the remaining amount deferred over the life of the customer relationship. The Company generally bills customers in advance for the services they have chosen to use and record such amounts as deferred revenue until the services are provided. Customer services paid for in advance are recorded as income when earned. Advertising sales are recognized in the period that the advertisements are broadcast. Local or state government authorities impose franchise fees on the majority of the Company's systems ranging up to a federally mandated maximum of 5% of gross revenues as defined in the franchise agreements. Such fees are collected on a monthly basis from the Company's customers and are periodically remitted to franchise authorities. Because franchise fees are the Company's obligation, the Company presents them on a gross basis in revenue with a corresponding operating expense. Franchise fees reported on a gross basis in revenue amounted to approximately $1.4 million, $46.3 million and $47.8 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company's best estimate of uncollectible balances in the accounts receivable balance. The allowance is based on the number of days outstanding, customer balances, historical experience and other currently available information. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and accounts receivable. Concentration of credit risk with respect to the Company's cash balance is limited. The Company maintains or invests its cash with highly qualified financial institutions. With respect to the Company's receivables, credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers, individually small balances and short payment terms. Programming Costs The Company purchases certain analog, digital and premium programming provided by program suppliers whose compensation is typically based on a flat fee per customer at the negotiated rates included in the programming contracts. The cost of the right to provide network programming under such arrangements is recorded in operating expenses in the month the programming is distributed. Programming costs are paid each month based on calculations performed by the Company and are subject to adjustment based on periodic audits performed by the programmers. Net programming costs included in the operating costs line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was $17.9 million, $594.2 million and $617.4 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively.

Advertising expense, included in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, was approximately $1.9 million, $62.7 million and $58.7 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Equity Based Compensation Prior to the Altice Acquisition, the general partners of the partnerships that held the shares of Cequel Corporation (collectively, the "Carry Interest Partnerships"), each adopted a separate carried interest plan (see Footnote 19). The Company measured the cost of employee services received in exchange for carried interest units based on the fair value of the award at each reporting period. The Company used the Monte Carlo Simulation Method to estimate the fair value of the awards. Because the Monte Carlo Simulation Method required the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the carried interest units granted. The time to liquidity event assumption is based on management's judgment. The equity volatility assumption was estimated using the historical weekly volatility of publicly traded comparable companies. The risk-free rate assumed in valuing the units was based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rates for a period matching the expected time to liquidity event. The Company's total equity value was estimated by a third party using a range of indicated business enterprise values. The plan was terminated on December 21, 2015, concurrent with the Altice Acquisition. Income Taxes The Company provides for estimated income taxes for amounts payable or refundable on current year income tax returns, as well as the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using existing guidance from the FASB. This guidance also requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized in the future. Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded (See Footnote 16). On September 15, 2014, the Company filed its U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return for the calendar year 2013 reflecting an adjustment to a previously filed position which effectively eliminated the Company's uncertain tax position. The elimination of the uncertain tax position resulted in a corresponding adjustment to the Company's net deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets which resulted in a net benefit to income taxes of $13.0 million for the period. Cash and Cash Equivalents For financial reporting purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities at purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. F-117 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including all material, labor and certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities (or fair value at date of Acquisition). While the Company's capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, costs are tracked by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on a specific asset basis. For assets that are sold or retired, the estimated historical cost and related accumulated depreciation is removed. Costs associated with initial customer installations and the additions of network equipment necessary to enable advanced services are capitalized. Costs capitalized as part of initial customer installations include materials, labor and certain indirect costs. Indirect costs are associated with the activities of the Company's personnel who assist in connecting and activating the new service. Indirect costs include employee benefits and payroll taxes, direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, consisting of installation and construction vehicle costs, the cost of dispatch personnel and indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated life or the term of the related leases. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacements, including replacement of cable drops, are capitalized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: Buildings and improvements 3 - 20 years Customer equipment and installations 4 - 7 years Capitalized leases 3 - 15 years Vehicles 3 - 5 years Broadband distribution systems 4 - 25 years Office furniture, tools and equipment 2 - 7 years Capitalized Internal Costs Costs capitalized as part of new customer installations include materials, subcontractor costs and internal direct labor costs, including service technicians and internal overhead costs incurred to connect the customer to the plant from the time of installation scheduling through the time service is activated and functioning. The internal direct labor cost capitalized is based on a combination of the actual and estimated time to complete the installation. Overhead capitalized consists mainly of employee benefits, such as payroll taxes and health insurance, directly associated with that portion of the capitalized labor and vehicle operating costs related to capitalizable activities. Capitalized internal payroll costs were approximately $1.2 million, $49.2 million and $46.2 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor years ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Related capitalized overhead were approximately $0.7 million, $28.7 million and $29.0 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor years ended December 31, 2014, respectively. F-118 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related debt. Franchises Franchise rights are periodically reviewed to determine if each franchise has a finite life or an indefinite life in accordance with goodwill and other intangible asset financial accounting standards. Accordingly, the Company believes its franchises qualify for indefinite life treatment and are not amortized against earnings but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances (see Footnote 13). Costs incurred in negotiating and renewing broadband franchises are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the renewal period. Accounting for Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets (e.g., property, plant and equipment) do not require that an annual impairment test be performed; instead, long-lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Triggering events include the more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, the impairment test first requires a comparison of estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the asset would be deemed to be impaired. The impairment charge would then be measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale, and there is an active program to locate a buyer), the impairment test involves comparing the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value. To the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset's estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, no triggering events have occurred and no impairment tests were performed. Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon occurrence of a triggering event. Accounting guidance related to goodwill impairment testing provides an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a F-119 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company performs a qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether the first step of the goodwill impairment test is necessary. If, after this qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then no further quantitative testing would be necessary. If determined necessary as a result of the qualitative assessment described above, or if we do not perform the qualitative assessment as allowed under authoritative guidance from the FASB, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the Company to its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis corroborated by a market-based approach. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market-based approach. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based on assumed growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the Company. If the estimated fair value of the Company exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of the Company exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the goodwill carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value of the Company is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the Company (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the Company had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the Company was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the Company's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Other intangible assets not subject to amortization, primarily cable franchise rights, are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be deemed to be impaired. The impairment charge would then be measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value. The estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method ("Greenfield Method"), which entails identifying the projected discrete cash flows related to such cable franchise rights and discounting them back to the valuation date. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows attributable to cable franchise rights and identification of appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. F-120 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The discount rates used in the Greenfield Method are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. For the Company's impairment analyses completed in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014 the Company did not perform a qualitative assessment for any of its six reporting units and instead began with the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis. The Company's impairment analyses for 2015 and 2014 indicated no impairment of its goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization. Asset Retirement Obligations Accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that a liability be recognized for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a lease or franchise agreement is not renewed, certain of the Company's franchise agreements and leases contain provisions requiring the Company to remove equipment or restore facilities. The Company expects to continually renew its franchise agreements and has concluded that the related franchise right is an indefinite lived intangible asset. The Company could be required to incur substantial restoration or removal costs related to these franchise agreements in the unlikely event a franchise agreement containing such a provision were no longer expected to be renewed. The Company would record an estimated liability at the time that it became probable that a franchise agreement would not be renewed. The obligations related to the removal provisions contained in the Company's lease agreements or any disposal obligations related to the Company's operating assets are not material to the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operation or are not estimable. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their short maturities (see Footnote 11). Derivative Financial Instruments Accounting for derivative financial instruments requires that all derivative instruments be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company's policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The new guidance stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those F-121 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) periods) beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is not permitted, and the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards update No. 2015-14, Deferral of Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of these standards on its ongoing operations or financial reporting. In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ("ASU 2014-15"), which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ("ASU 2015-03"). The new guidance stipulates that an entity should present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, and amortization of the costs should be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted, and entities would apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with line-of-Credit Arrangements ("ASU 2015-15"), which provides additional guidance to ASU 2015-03 to address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 noted that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ("ASU 2015-16"), which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Prior to the issuance of the standard, entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amount recognized in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods F-122 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ("ASU 2015-17"), which requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. 4. Altice Acquisition On December 21, 2015, Altice N.V., a public company with limited liability ( naamloze vennootshcap ) under Dutch law ("Altice"), as successor in interest to Altice S.A., certain other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Altice (the "Purchasers"), acquired approximately 70% of the total outstanding equity interests in Cequel Corporation (the "Altice Acquisition") from the direct and indirect stockholders of Cequel Corporation (the "Sellers"). Prior to the date hereof, Cequel Corporation was directly or indirectly owned by investment funds advised by BC Partners Limited ("BCP"), CPPIB-Suddenlink LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB" and together with BCP, the "Sponsors"), and IW4MK Carry Partnership LP (the "Management Holder" and together with the Sponsors, the "Stockholders"). The consideration for the acquired equity interests was based on a total equity valuation for 100% of the capital and voting rights of Cequel Corporation of $4,132.0 million, which includes $2,956.4 million of cash consideration, $675.6 million of retained equity held by the Sponsors and $500 million funded by the issuance by an affiliate of Altice of a senior vendor note that is subscribed by the Sponsors. Following the closing of the Altice Acquisition, the Sponsors retained equity interests in Cequel Corporation representing, in the aggregate, 30% of Cequel Corporation's outstanding capital stock on a post-closing basis. In addition, the carry interest plans of the Stockholders were cashed out based on an agreement between the Sponsors and the Management Holder whereby payments were made to participants in such carry interest plans, including certain officers and directors of Cequel and Cequel Corporation. In connection with the Altice Acquisition, on June 12, 2015, affiliates of Altice issued (i) $320 million principal amount of senior holdco notes due 2025 (the "Holdco Notes"), (ii) $300 million principal amount of senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Senior Notes") and (iii) $1.1 billion principal amount of senior secured notes due 2023 (the "Senior Secured Notes"), the proceeds from which were placed in escrow, to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Altice Acquisition. The Holdco Notes were issued by Altice US Finance S.A. (the "Holdco Notes Issuer"), an indirect subsidiary of Altice, bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum and were issued at a price of 98.275%. The 2025 Senior Notes were issued by Altice US Finance II Corporation (the "Senior Notes Issuer"), an indirect subsidiary of Altice, bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum and were issued at a price of 100.00%. The Senior Secured Notes were issued by Altice US Finance I Corporation (the "Senior Secured Notes Issuer"), an indirect subsidiary of Altice, bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum and were issued at a price of 100.00%. Interest on the Holdco Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15. The Holdco Notes F-123 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 4. Altice Acquisition (Continued) will automatically exchange into an equal aggregate principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes once the 2025 Senior Notes Issuer builds sufficient restricted payment capacity and the ability to incur additional indebtedness in excess of the aggregate amount of the Holdco Notes. Following the consummation of the Altice Acquisition and related transactions, (i) the indirect parent of the Holdco Notes Issuer owned 70% of Cequel Corporation, (ii) the 2025 Senior Notes Issuer merged into Cequel, the Senior Notes became the obligations of Cequel and Cequel Capital Corporation became the co-issuer of the 2025 Senior Notes, and (iii) the equity interests in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer were contributed through one or more intermediary steps to Suddenlink, and the Senior Secured Notes were guaranteed by Cequel Communications Holdings II LLC, Suddenlink and certain of the subsidiaries of Suddenlink and are secured by certain assets of Cequel Communications Holdings II LLC, Suddenlink and its subsidiaries. In connection with the Altice Acquisition, we received consent from holders of the 2020 Notes to, among other things, waive any obligation that the Issuers may have under the 2020 Indenture to repurchase the 2020 Notes as a result of the consummation of the Altice Acquisition and make certain related changes to the 2020 Indenture (the "Indenture Amendments"), and the Issuers entered into a first supplemental indenture to the 2020 Indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), containing the Indenture Amendments. In exchange for this consent, we paid holders who consented to these amendments an aggregate fee of approximately $26.3 million at the closing of the Altice Acquisition, at which time the Indenture Amendments become effective. In connection with the Altice Acquisition, we received consent from lenders under the credit and guaranty agreement, dated February 14, 2012, entered into by Cequel Communications, LLC, Cequel Communications Holdings II, LLC, certain subsidiaries of Cequel Communications, LLC and a syndicate of lenders, as amended, which provides for up to $2.7 billion of loans in the aggregate, consisting of a $2.2 billion term loan facility and a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the "Existing Credit Facility"), to amend the definition of change of control and certain other related definitions therein so that the consummation of the Altice Acquisition did not constitute a change of control and corresponding event of default thereunder (the "Existing Credit Facility Amendments"), and we entered into a Second Amendment and Consent to the Existing Credit Facility (the "Second Amendment and Consent") with the lenders thereunder, containing, among other things, the Existing Credit Facility Amendments. In exchange for this consent, we paid lenders who consented to these amendments an aggregate fee of approximately $6.8 million. In addition, lenders holding (a) $290.0 million of loans and commitments under the existing revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Facility and (b) approximately $815.4 million of loans under the existing term loan facility under the Existing Credit Facility consented to roll over, on a cashless basis, such lenders' loans and commitments under the Existing Credit Facility into loans and commitments of the same amount under a new credit facility (the "New Credit Facility") made available to Altice US Finance I Corporation effective upon the consummation of the Altice Acquisition (the "Roll Consents"). The New Credit Facility will mature on December 21, 2022, or sooner if certain amounts of the 2020 Notes, the 2021 Notes or the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding at certain future dates. Upon the closing of the Altice Acquisition, the $290.0 million of loans and commitments under the existing revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Facility F-124 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 4. Altice Acquisition (Continued) that lenders elected to rollover into the New Credit Facility, plus $60.0 million of new revolving commitments from other lenders, formed a new $350 million revolving credit facility under the New Credit Facility, and all remaining commitments under the then existing $500 million revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Facility were terminated. We applied business combination accounting for the Altice Acquisition. This resulted in the Company having a new accounting basis in the identifiable assets and liabilities and no retained earnings or accumulated losses. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements on or after December 21, 2015 are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements prior to that date. The financial statements for the periods ended prior to December 20, 2015 do not include the effect of any changes in our corporate structure or changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities as a result of business combination accounting. Business combination accounting provides, among other things, for a determination of the value to be assigned to the equity of the company as of a date selected for financial reporting purposes. The value of the Company was set forth at approximately $9.1 billion. The value was based upon the purchase price that the Purchasers paid to acquire the Company on December 21, 2015, and including liabilities assumed. Further, DCF analysis was completed for purchase price allocation purposes. A more detailed explanation of the DCF analysis is discussed below. The basis for the DCF analysis was the Company's projections. These seven-year projections were based on management's assumptions including among others, penetration rates for basic and digital video, high speed Internet, and telephone; revenue growth rates; operating margins; and capital expenditures. The assumptions are derived based on the Company's and its peers' historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the cable industry. The DCF analysis was completed using a discount rate of approximately 9.0% based on the Company's cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and a perpetuity growth rate of 2.5%. The value is highly dependent on the achievement of the future financial results contemplated in the projections. The estimates and assumptions made in the valuation are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would have significantly affected the value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth, programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures and the discount F-125 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 4. Altice Acquisition (Continued) rate utilized. The following table summarizes the estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Altice Acquisition (dollars in millions): Amount Recognized as of December 21, 2015 Current Assets $ 156.2 Accounts Receivable 179.4 Property, plant and equipment 2,208.3 Goodwill ($538.9 million tax deductible) 2,040.4 Intangible assets 6,089.8 Other non-current assets 62.1 Current liabilities (571.4 ) Long-term debt (6,056.7 ) Deferred income taxes (1,944.8 ) Other non-current liabilities (4.0 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 2,159.3 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The significant assumptions related to the valuations of our assets and liabilities in connection with business combination accounting include the following: Property, plant and equipment was given a preliminary fair value of $2.2 billion as of December 21, 2015. In establishing fair value for the vast majority of the Company's property, plant and equipment, the cost approach was utilized. The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation, and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. The cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. The Company identified the following intangible assets to be valued: franchise and patent rights, trade names and subscriber relationships. Franchise rights were valued using the greenfield method and were given a preliminary value of $4,984.6 million as of December 21, 2015. Trade names were valued using a deviation of the income approach, known as the royalty savings method, and were given a preliminary value of $37.9 million as of December 21, 2015. Subscriber relationships were valued using a deviation of the excess earnings method and were given a preliminary value of $1,067.4 million as of December 21, 2015. (See Footnote 13) Long-term debt was valued at fair value as of December 21, 2015 using quoted market prices (Level 2). The carrying value of most other assets and liabilities approximated fair value as of December 21, 2015. The contractual value of accounts receivable as of December 21, 2015 is approximately $191.2 million, compared to a preliminary fair value of $179.4 million. F-126 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 4. Altice Acquisition (Continued) As a result of applying business combination accounting, the Company recorded preliminary goodwill of $2.0 billion, which represented the excess of organization value over amounts assigned to the other identifiable tangible and intangible assets, arising from expectations of future operational performance and cash generation. 5. Acquisitions of Broadband Systems On January 2, 2014, the Company consummated its acquisition of three cable systems from Northland Communications ("Northland"), for a purchase price of $40.6 million (the "Northland Acquisition"). The Northland Acquisition was funded by cash on hand. The Company incurred no acquisition related costs for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and incurred acquisition related costs of approximately $0.2 million for the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, which are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounted for the Northland Acquisition in accordance with ASC Topic 805, and the operating results of Northland have been consolidated from the date of acquisition. The total estimated purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their fair values using Level 3 inputs (see Footnote 11). The excess of the estimated purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill, which represents the value of expected synergies and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.

F-130 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 10. Long-Term Debt (Continued) Existing Credit Facility On February 14, 2012, Suddenlink, Cequel Communications Holdings II, LLC ("Holdings II"), Cequel's direct subsidiary and the direct parent of Suddenlink, certain subsidiaries of Suddenlink and a syndicate of lenders entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement, (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), which provides for up to $2.7 billion of loans in the aggregate, consisting of a $2.2 billion term loan facility funded at closing and a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the "Existing Credit Facility"). The revolving credit facility was scheduled to mature on February 14, 2017. The term loan facility is scheduled to mature on February 14, 2019. The interest rate on the term loans outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement initially equaled the prime rate plus 1.75% or the LIBOR rate plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, while the interest rate on the revolver loans initially equaled the prime rate plus 1.50% or the LIBOR rate plus 2.50%. The term loan facility requires quarterly repayments in annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount, with the remainder due at maturity. The debt under the Existing Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in the capital stock of Suddenlink and substantially all of the present and future assets of Suddenlink and its restricted subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by Holdings II, as well as all of Suddenlink's existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement. The Existing Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants. In addition, the Existing Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Suddenlink and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes, make investments or loans, engage in transactions with affiliates, pay dividends, and make acquisitions and dispose of assets. The Existing Credit Agreement also contains a maximum senior secured leverage maintenance covenant. Additionally, the Existing Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including failure to make payments, breaches of covenants and representations, cross defaults to other indebtedness, unpaid judgments, changes of control and bankruptcy events. The lenders' commitments to fund amounts under the revolving credit facility are subject to certain customary conditions. On April 30, 2014, the Company was required to make an excess cash flow recapture payment of $72.7 million in accordance with the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. Lenders holding approximately 16.4% of the outstanding term loans under the Existing Credit Facility waived their right to receive this payment. Accordingly, the Company made an excess cash flow recapture payment of $60.8 million to the other lenders under the Existing Credit Facility and retained $11.9 million related to the waived excess cash flow recapture payment. On December 29, 2014, the Company made a voluntary principal prepayment in the amount of $55.0 million, using cash on hand. In connection with the Altice Acquisition, we received consent from lenders under the Existing Credit Facility to amend the definition of change of control and certain other related definitions therein so that the consummation of the Altice Acquisition did not constitute a change of control and corresponding event of default thereunder (the "Existing Credit Facility Amendments"), and we entered into a Second Amendment and Consent to the Existing Credit Facility (the "Second F-131 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 10. Long-Term Debt (Continued) Amendment and Consent") with the lenders thereunder, containing, among other things, the Existing Credit Facility Amendments. In exchange for this consent, we paid lenders who consented to these amendments an aggregate fee of approximately $6.8 million. Additionally, as of December 21, 2015, in connection with the formation of the New Credit Facility (as described below) the interest rate on the term loans outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement was increased to the prime rate plus 1.8125% or the LIBOR rate plus 2.8125%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and the commitments under the then existing $500 million revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Facility were terminated. On April 29, 2016, the Company will be required to make an excess cash flow recapture payment of $80.7 million in accordance with the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. New Credit Facility In connection with the Altice Acquisition, lenders holding (a) $290.0 million of loans and commitments under the existing revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Facility and (b) approximately $815.4 million of loans under the existing term loan facility under the Existing Credit Facility consented to roll over, on a cashless basis, such lenders' loans and commitments under the Existing Credit Facility into loans and commitments of the same amount under the New Credit Facility made available to Altice US Finance I Corporation effective upon the consummation of the Altice Acquisition. The New Credit Facility will mature on December 21, 2022, or sooner if certain amounts of the 2020 Notes, the 2021 Notes or the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding at certain future dates. Upon the closing of the Altice Acquisition, the $290.0 million of loans and commitments under the existing revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Facility that lenders elected to rollover into the New Credit Facility, plus $60.0 million of new revolving commitments from other lenders, formed a new $350 million revolving credit facility under the New Credit Facility, and all remaining commitments under the then existing $500 million revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Facility were terminated. The revolving credit facility under the New Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on December 21, 2020. The New Credit Facility will mature on December 21, 2022, or sooner if certain amounts of the 2020 Notes, the 2021 Notes or the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding at certain future dates. The interest rate on the term loans outstanding under the New Credit Agreement equal the prime rate plus 2.25% or the LIBOR rate plus 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, while the interest rate on the revolver loans equal the prime rate plus 2.25% or the LIBOR rate plus 3.25%. The term loan facility requires quarterly repayments in annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount, commencing on March 31, 2016, with the remainder due at maturity. The debt under the New Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in the capital stock of Suddenlink and substantially all of the present and future assets of Suddenlink and its restricted subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by Holdings II, as well as all of Suddenlink's existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the New Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants. In addition, the New Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of F-132 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 10. Long-Term Debt (Continued) Suddenlink and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes, make investments or loans, engage in transactions with affiliates, pay dividends, and make acquisitions and dispose of assets. The New Credit Agreement also contains a maximum senior secured leverage maintenance covenant. Additionally, the New Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including failure to make payments, breaches of covenants and representations, cross defaults to other indebtedness, unpaid judgments, changes of control and bankruptcy events. The lenders' commitments to fund amounts under the revolving credit facility are subject to certain customary conditions. Senior Secured Notes On June 12, 2015, affiliates of Altice issued $1.1 billion principal amount of Senior Secured Notes, the proceeds from which were placed in escrow to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Altice Acquisition. The Senior Secured Notes were issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, an indirect subsidiary of Altice, bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum and were issued at a price of 100.00%. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15. Following the consummation of the Altice Acquisition and related transactions the equity interests in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer were contributed through one or more intermediary steps to Suddenlink, and the Senior Secured Notes were guaranteed by Cequel Communications Holdings II LLC, Suddenlink and certain of the subsidiaries of Suddenlink and are secured by certain assets of Cequel Communications Holdings II LLC, Suddenlink and its subsidiaries. Senior Notes On September 9, 2014, the Issuers issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Mirror Notes. The proceeds from the sale, plus cash on hand, were used to make a distribution in the amount of $600 million to our parent (see Footnote 20) and pay related fees and expenses. The 2021 Mirror Notes mature on December 15, 2021. Interest is payable on the 2021 Mirror Notes semi-annually in cash on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2021 Mirror Notes have substantially the same terms as the Initial 2021 Notes. On June 12, 2015, affiliates of Altice issued $300 million principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes, the proceeds from which were placed in escrow, to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Altice Acquisition. The 2025 Senior Notes were issued by the 2025 Senior Notes Issuer, an indirect subsidiary of Altice, bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum and were issued at a price of 100.00%. Interest on the 2025 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15. Following the consummation of the Altice Acquisition and related transactions, the 2025 Senior Notes Issuer merged into Cequel, the 2025 Senior Notes became the obligations of Cequel and Cequel Capital Corporation became the co-issuer of the 2025 Senior Notes. On June 12, 2015, affiliates of Altice issued $320 million principal amount of the Holdco Notes, the proceeds from which were placed in escrow, to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Altice Acquisition. The Holdco Notes were issued by the Holdco Notes Issuer, an indirect subsidiary of Altice, bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum and were issued at a price of 100.00%. Interest on F-133 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 10. Long-Term Debt (Continued) the Holdco Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 (See Footnote 17). The Holdco Notes will automatically exchange into an equal aggregate principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes once the 2025 Senior Notes Issuer builds sufficient restricted payment capacity and the ability to incur additional indebtedness in excess of the aggregate amount of the Holdco Notes. This automatic exchange is expected to take place during the second quarter of 2016. The Issuers have no ability to service interest or principal on the Senior Notes, other than through any dividends or distributions received from Suddenlink. Suddenlink is restricted in certain circumstances, from paying dividends or distributions to the Issuers by the terms of the Credit Agreements. However, the Credit Agreements permit Suddenlink to make dividends and distributions subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including pro forma compliance with a maximum senior secured leverage ratio, and that no event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would be caused by the making of such dividends or other distributions, and based on, among other things, availability under a restricted payment basket. The Senior Notes are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any subsidiaries of the Issuers, including Suddenlink. The Indentures contain certain covenants, agreements and events of default which are customary with respect to non-investment grade debt securities, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. The Company's debt agreements include restrictive covenants such as restrictions on additional indebtedness. The Credit Agreements also require the Company to satisfy a financial maintenance covenant. The Company was in compliance with those covenants as of December 31, 2015. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The Company did not incur any losses on extinguishment of debt for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015 and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company has established a process for determining fair value of its financial assets and liabilities using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such valuation methods are not available, fair value is based on internally or externally developed models using market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, where available. Fair value may be subsequently adjusted to ensure that those assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value estimate as of the Company's reporting date. Fair value guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements, based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, as follows:  Level 1inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  Level 2inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.  Level 3inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Financial Assets and Liabilities The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment, however, is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of F-135 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) fair value. Accordingly the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt at December 31, 2015 and 2014 is based on quoted market prices for the debt and is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Unrealized gains or losses on debt do not result in the realization or expenditure of cash and are not recognized for financial reporting purposes. A summary of the carrying value and fair value of the Company's debt at December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows: Successor December 31, 2015 Predecessor December 31, 2014 Carrying Value(a) Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Existing credit facility $ 1,459,077 $ 1,455,231 $ 2,327,948 2,289,866 New credit facility 795,138 797,096   6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 1,447,659 1,451,250 1,527,331 1,560,000 5.125% Senior Notes due 2021(b) 1,094,461 1,118,750 1,236,731 1,225,000 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 1,089,036 1,102,750   7.750% Senior Notes due 2025 273,821 276,000   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 6,159,192 $ 6,201,077 $ 5,092,010 $ 5,074,866 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a) On December 21, 2015, we applied business combination accounting to adjust our debt to reflect fair value. Therefore, as of December 31, 2015, the accreted values presented above generally represent the fair value at December 21, 2015, plus or minus the accretions to the balance sheet date of December 31, 2015. (b) Includes the Initial 2021 Notes and the 2021 Mirror Notes. Non-financial Assets and Liabilities The Company's non-financial assets such as franchises, property, plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence that an impairment may exist. No impairments were recorded for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014.

Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations The Company has obligations to make future payments for goods and services under certain contractual arrangements. These contractual obligations secure future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of the Company's operations. For example, the Company is contractually committed to make minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. in accordance with applicable accounting rules, the future rights and obligations pertaining to firm commitments, such as operating lease obligations and certain purchase obligations under contracts, are not reflected as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The following table summarizes the estimated timing and effect of the Company's payment obligations as of December 31, 2015 on the Company's liquidity and cash flows in future periods (dollars in millions): Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Operating lease obligations(1) $ 27.9 $ 7.9 $ 6.0 $ 4.4 $ 3.6 $ 2.9 $ 3.1 Other commitments(2) 26.4 26.0 0.4     ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total contractual obligation $ 54.3 $ 33.9 $ 6.4 $ 4.4 $ 3.6 $ 2.9 $ 3.1 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (1) The Company leases certain site and office space under non-cancelable operating leases. Rent expense for site leases and office space was approximately $0.2 million, $8.1 million and $7.6 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. (2) Represents contractual obligations under programming and content purchase agreements and various other contractual obligations. The following items are not included as contractual obligations due to various factors discussed below. However, the Company incurs these costs as part of its operations:  The Company rents utility poles used in its operations. Generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but the Company anticipates that such rentals will recur. Rent expense for pole rental attachments was approximately $0.4 million, $13.9 million and $12.9 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively.  The Company pays franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. Franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $1.4 million, $46.2 million and $48.2 million for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through F-137 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 12. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) December 31, 2015, the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively.  The Company has cable franchise agreements containing provisions requiring the construction of cable plant and the provision of services to customers within the franchise areas. In connection with these obligations under existing franchise agreements, the Company obtains letters of credit guaranteeing performance to municipalities and public utilities and payment of insurance premiums. Such letters of credit as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $21.2 million and $18.0 million, respectively, which reduced the availability under the $350.0 million and $500.0 million revolving credit facility, respectively, to approximately $328.8 million and $482.0 million, respectively. Payments under these arrangements are required only in the event of nonperformance. The Company does not expect that these contingent commitments will result in any amounts being paid within at least the next twelve months. Litigation The Company is a defendant or a co-defendant in several lawsuits involving alleged infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of its businesses. Other industry participants are also defendants in certain of these cases, and, in many cases, the Company expects that any potential liability would be the responsibility of the Company's equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual indemnification provisions. In the event that a court ultimately determines that the Company infringed on any intellectual property rights, the Company may be subject to substantial damages and/or an injunction that could require the Company or the Company's vendors to modify certain products and services the Company offers to its customers, as well as negotiate royalty or license agreements with respect to the patents at issue. While the Company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company cannot predict the outcome of any such claims nor can it reasonably estimate the range of possible loss. From time to time, the Company is involved in other litigation and regulatory proceedings arising out of the Company's operations. Management believes that the Company is not currently a party to any other legal or regulatory proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. 13. Intangible Assets The Company does not amortize indefinite lived intangible assets. Accordingly, all franchises that qualify for indefinite life treatment are not amortized against earnings but instead are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. Based on testing of impairment of indefinite lived intangible asset guidance, franchises are aggregated into essentially inseparable asset groups to conduct the valuations. The asset groups generally represent geographic clustering of the Company's broadband systems into groups by which such systems are F-138 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 13. Intangible Assets (Continued) managed and by which the franchise rights are associated and tracked. Management believes such grouping represents the highest and best use of those assets for purposes of evaluating impairment of its franchises. The impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. The Company determines the fair value of the intangible asset using a DCF analysis, which utilizes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market-based approach. The Company performs its impairment assessment of its goodwill at the same inseparable asset group level as franchises discussed above. The asset groups generally represent geographic clustering of the Company's broadband systems into groups by which such systems are managed and by which goodwill is tracked. The impairment test for goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determines its fair value using a DCF analysis corroborated by a market-based approach, which utilize significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy. On December 21, 2015, the Company applied business combination accounting and adjusted its franchise, goodwill and other intangible assets including trademarks and customer relationships to reflect fair value. As a result of applying business combination accounting, the Company recorded goodwill, which is tax deductible, of $2.04 billion, which represents the excess of organization value over amounts assigned to the other assets and liabilities (see Footnote 4). The Company determined the estimated fair value utilizing an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flows attributable to each of the intangible assets identified for each unit assuming a discount rate. This approach makes use of unobservable factors such as projected revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, and a discount rate applied to the estimated cash flows. The determination of the discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital approach, which uses a market participant's cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows. The Company estimated discounted future cash flows using reasonable and appropriate assumptions including among others, penetration rates for basic and digital video, high speed Internet, and telephone, revenue growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures. The assumptions are derived based on the Company's and its peers' historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the cable industry. The estimates and assumptions made in the Company's valuations are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth, programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures and the discount rate utilized. F-139 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 13. Intangible Assets (Continued) Franchises, for valuation purposes, are defined as the future economic benefits of the right to solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and the right to deploy and market new services, such as interactivity and telephone, to potential customers (service marketing rights). Franchises rights of $4.98 billion were recorded as a result of the application of business combination accounting. Franchises are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely and as such will continue to be tested for impairment annually. Subscriber relationships, for valuation purposes, represent the value of the business relationship with existing customers (less the anticipated customer churn), and are calculated by projecting the discrete future after-tax cash flows from these customers, including the right to deploy and market additional services to these customers. The Company recorded $1.07 billion of customer relationships in connection with the application of business combination accounting. Subscriber relationships will be amortized on an accelerated method over a useful life of four years based on the period over which current customers are expected to generate cash flows. The Company recorded $37.9 million in trade names in connection with the application of business combination accounting. The fair value of trade names was determined using the relief from royalty method which applies a fair royalty ratio to estimated revenue. Trade names will be amortized on an accelerated method over a useful life of 2 years based on the period over which the Company expects to continue to use each trade name. The results of the Company's analysis of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 indicated no impairment of the carrying value of those assets and no accumulated impairment of goodwill existed.

Income and Other Taxes (Continued) purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows as of December 31: Successor 2015 Predecessor 2014 Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 631,216 $ 615,015 State income tax credits 3,809 3,908 Accrued expenses 20,634 13,901 Other 888 1,058 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total gross deferred tax assets 656,547 633,882 Less: valuation allowance (1,283 ) (2,042 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net deferred tax asset 655,264 631,840 Deferred tax liabilities: Book over tax basis of depreciable assets (385,437 ) (234,342 ) Book over tax basis of amortizable assets (1,795,262 ) (669,907 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gross deferred tax liabilities (2,180,699 ) (904,249 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net deferred tax liabilities $ (1,525,435 ) $ (272,409 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The Company has approximately $1,709.0 million and $1,653.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which will expire at various dates through 2035. In addition, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards, net of US Federal income taxes, of approximately $33.1 million and $36.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which will expire at various dates through 2035. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has a $1.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, valuation allowance on state net operating loss carryforwards as it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain limitations arising from changes in ownership rules under the Internal Revenue Code and state taxing authorities. The Company does not expect the limitations to impact the ability to utilize the losses prior to their expiration. The utilization of the net operating losses and the acquired net operating losses will be determined based on the ordering rules required by the applicable taxing jurisdiction. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting guidance for such items. This guidance prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. The Company recognizes income tax benefits for those income tax provisions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the positions. On September 15, 2014, the Company filed its consolidated US Corporate Income Tax Return for the calendar year 2013 reflecting an adjustment to a previously filed position which effectively eliminated the Company's uncertain tax position. The elimination of the uncertain tax position resulted in a corresponding adjustment to the Company's net deferred tax liabilities and F-145 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 16. Income and Other Taxes (Continued) deferred tax assets which resulted in a net benefit to income taxes of $13.0 million for the year. The elimination of the uncertain tax position recognized in 2014 reduced the Company's effective tax rate by 51.2%. Changes in the Company's reserve for uncertain income tax positions, excluding the related accrual for interest and penalties are presented below: Successor Period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015 Predecessor Period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015 Predecessor Year Ended December 31, 2014 Balance, beginning of period $  $  $ 33,127 Additions for tax positions related to prior years    Reductions for tax positions related to prior years   (33,127 ) Additions for tax positions related to current year    Reductions for tax positions related to current year    Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities    Reductions due to expiration of statute of limitations    ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance, end of period $  $  $  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Tax years ending 2011 through 2014 remain subject to examination and assessment. By statute, the Company's use of certain carryforward attributes that were generated prior to 2010 will allow the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to subsequently examine those periods. During 2014, the IRS concluded its examination of the income tax return for a subsidiary of the Company, Cequel Holdings, for the tax years ending December 31, 2011 and November 15, 2012, resulting in no adjustments. In 2015, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS on the audit of the income tax return for the successor tax period ending December 31, 2012, resulting in no material adjustments to the Company's financial statements. We adjust our tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2015, we have no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2015, the Company does not currently have any uncertain tax positions, nor does it believe that any events or rulings will cause one, within the next twelve months. However, various events could cause the Company's current expectations to change in the future.

Related Party Transactions Prior to the consummation of the Altice Acquisition, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Cequel Communications Management Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2012, as amended (the "Management Agreement"), Cequel III, LLC ("Cequel III") provided certain executive, administrative and managerial services to the broadband systems owned by Cequel Holdings and its subsidiaries. Compensation under the terms of the agreement was an annual base fee of $5.3 million, set in 2006, paid quarterly in arrears. The base fee increased 5% annually on each anniversary date of the Management Agreement. The Cequel Holdings Board of Directors approved an additional incentive fee of $3.2 million and $1.4 million to Cequel III, LLC for the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. The Management Agreement was terminated upon consummation of the Altice Acquisition, so no incentive fees were approved during the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Total compensation paid to Cequel III, LLC under the Management Agreement, which is included in the selling, general and administrative line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, was $11.0 million and $9.1 million for the predecessor period from January 1, 2015 through December 20, 2015, and the predecessor year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. The Management Agreement was terminated upon consummation of the Altice Acquisition, so no fees were paid to Cequel III during the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $4.8 million recorded as a payable to Cequel III, LLC, primarily related to management and incentive fees. No payables to Cequel III, LLC were recorded at December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement of CVC 2 B.V., a subsidiary of Altice and indirect owner of Cequel Corporation, dated as of December 21, 2015, Altice provides certain executive services, including CEO, CFO and COO services, to the Company. Compensation under the terms of the agreement is an annual fee of $10.0 million. At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $0.3 million recorded as a payable to Altice, related to services provided for the successor period from December 21, 2015 through December 31, 2015. On December 21, the Holdco Notes Issuer loaned the proceeds of the Holdco Notes to the Company to consummate the Altice Acquisition. The intercompany loan was recorded as Due to Parent at the fair value of the related debt at the time of the transaction. Once the Senior Notes Issuer builds sufficient restricted payment capacity and the ability to incur additional indebtedness in excess of the aggregate amount of the Holdco Notes, the Holdco Notes will automatically exchange into an equal aggregate principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes and the intercompany loan will be eliminated. 18. Employee Benefit Plan The Company's employees may participate in a 401(k) plan. Employees that qualify for participation can contribute up to 15% of their salary, on a pre-tax basis, subject to a maximum contribution limit as determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches 50% of the first 6% of participant contributions. The Company contributed approximately $0.2 million, $6.6 million and $5.9 million, to the 401(k) plan for successor period from December 21, 2015 through F-147 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 18.

Equity Based Compensation Carried Interest Plan Prior to the Altice Acquisition, the general partners of the partnerships that held the shares of Cequel Corporation (collectively, the "Carry Interest Partnerships"), each adopted separate carried interest plans (collectively, the "Carried Interest Plan"), pursuant to which participants were awarded profit interest units in those partnerships. The purpose of the Carried Interest Plan was to provide participation in Cequel Corporation's long-term success and growth as an incentive to our executives, key employees, directors and other individuals who were responsible for and contributed to our management, growth and profitability, and to attract, retain and reward such participants. Pursuant to the Carried Interest Plan, each Carry Interest Partnership was permitted to issue no more than 1,000,000 carry units. The Carry Interest Partnerships issued an aggregate of approximately 996,500 carry units. The awarded carry units that were forfeited or canceled in accordance with the Carried Interest Plan were available, under certain terms and conditions, for reissue in subsequent awards. In certain instances following cessation of their services on behalf of us, the participants had put rights or the Carry Interest Partnerships had call rights, with respect to such participants' carry units. The carry units were to vest in quarterly installments over four years. Certain adjustments to the vesting schedules and/or certain distributions could occur in respect of certain specified events in connection with the Carried Interest Plan, which included: (i) a sale or series of sales by one of the Sponsors to the other resulting in the transferring Sponsor owning less than 35% of its original total Sponsor ownership interest following such transaction, (ii) a sale or series of sales by the Sponsors to third parties resulting in the Sponsors together owning less than 35% of their aggregate original Sponsor ownership interests, (iii) a sale or series of sales by either BC Partners or CPPIB to third parties resulting in such Sponsor owning less than 35% of its original total Sponsor ownership interest, or (iv) a sale of substantially all of the assets of Cequel Corporation or a sale of substantially all of its shares. The Carried Interest Plan entitled participants to receive certain percentages of net cash proceeds received by the Carry Interest Partnerships in connection with sales by the Carry Interest Partnerships of common stock of Cequel Corporation, distributions from Cequel Corporation or amounts received upon liquidation or dissolution of Cequel Corporation. The amounts were paid to participants once threshold amounts had been received by the Carry Interest Partnerships and paid to the Sponsors and Management Investors in Cequel Corporation, and the percentage of cash proceeds to which the participants are entitled increased as the return to the Sponsors and such Management Investors increased. The Company measured the cost of employee services received in exchange for carry units based on the fair value of the award at each reporting period. The Company used the Monte Carlo F-148 Table of Contents Cequel Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated) 19. Equity Based Compensation (Continued) Simulation Method to estimate the fair value of the awards. Because the Monte Carlo Simulation Method required the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions could have materially affected the fair value of the carried interest units granted. The time to liquidity event assumption was based on management's judgment. The equity volatility assumption were estimated using the historical weekly volatility of publicly traded comparable companies. The risk-free rate assumed in valuing the units was based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rates for a period matching the expected time to liquidity event. The Company's total equity value was estimated by a third party using a range of indicated business enterprise values. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized approximately $287.7 million and $30.7 million, respectively, related to the push down of non-cash compensation expense for employees of Cequel. Concurrent with the Altice Acquisition, the Carried Interest Plan was cashed out based on an agreement between the Sponsors and the Management Holder whereby payments were made to participants in such Carried Interest Plan, including certain officers and directors of Cequel and Cequel Corporation, and the Carried Interest Plan was terminated. 20. Equity Distributions On September 10, 2014, the Issuers used the proceeds from the sale of the 2021 Mirror Notes, plus $120.5 million of cash on hand, to make a distribution to Cequel Holdings in the amount of $600.0 million. Cequel Holdings then made a distribution to Cequel Corporation in the amount of $600.0 million. Cequel Corporation used this distribution to make a distribution in the amount of $600.0 million to holders of equity interests in Cequel Corporation. In December 2015, $32.2 million was contributed to the Company to pay certain transaction fees and expenses related to the Altice Acquisition.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. We are incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. Section 145(a) of the DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was unlawful. Section 145(b) of the DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of II-1 Table of Contents liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. Section 145(c) of the DGCL provides that to the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 of the DGCL, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. Section 145(e) of the DGCL provides that expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by an officer or director of the corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in Section 145 of the DGCL. Such expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by former directors and officers or other persons serving at the request of the corporation as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. Section 145(g) of the DGCL specifically allows a Delaware corporation to purchase liability insurance on behalf of its directors and officers and to insure against potential liability of such directors and officers regardless of whether the corporation would have the power to indemnify such directors and officers under Section 145 of the DGCL. Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL permits a Delaware corporation to include a provision in its certificate of incorporation eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. This provision, however, may not eliminate or limit a director's liability (1) for breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. In the three years preceding the filing of this registration statement, the registrant has issued the following securities that were not registered under the Securities Act: On September 16, 2015, in connection with the Optimum Acquisition, Altice USA, Inc.

Item 16. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. (a) Exhibits : The exhibit index attached hereto is incorporated herein by reference. (b) Financial statement schedules : No financial statement schedules are provided because the information called for is not required or is shown in the financial statements or the notes thereto. II-2 Table of Contents Item 17. Undertakings. The undersigned hereby undertakes as follows: (a) to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. (b) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act, and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (c)(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by us pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
