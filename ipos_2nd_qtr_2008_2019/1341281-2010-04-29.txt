Overview Intelsat operates the worlds largest fixed satellite services (FSS) business, providing a critical layer in the global communications infrastructure. Based on the scale and global coverage of our network, our extensive customer relationships and our reputation for highly reliable services, we believe that we are the leading FSS company in the world. We operate more satellite capacity in orbit, have more satellite capacity under contract, serve more commercial customers and deliver services in more countries than any other commercial satellite operator. 1 Table of Contents Our business provides mission critical communication services to the worlds leading media companies, wireline and wireless telecommunications operators, data networking service providers, multinational corporations, and Internet service providers (ISPs). We are the leading provider of commercial satellite capacity to the U.S. government and other select military organizations and contractors. The span of our business ranges from global distribution of content for media companies to essential network backbones for communications providers in high-growth emerging markets. Our business is the most diversified in the FSS sector based on types of service offerings, number of customers and revenue concentration by satellite and geography. This diversity reduces our market and operating risk. Our broad customer base and geographic presence also provide us with early opportunities to support new communications applications in a converging world. Our satellite-based solutions are a critical component of our customers infrastructures. Generally, our customers need the connectivity satellites provide so long as they are in business or pursuing their mission. This gives us stability during economic downturns. Our services also provide strong value in support of our customers businesses. For instance, for media applications, our satellite services provide efficient broadcast distribution that is difficult for terrestrial services to match. For network services applications, our satellite solutions provide higher reliability than is available from local terrestrial services, and allow our customers to reach geographies that they would otherwise be unable to serve. The Intelsat network supports:  The distribution of television entertainment and news programming;  The expansion of wireless networks in emerging regions without adequate infrastructure;  Ubiquitous access to broadband for Internet and fixed and mobile networks used by corporations and other organizations;  Completion and extension of international, national and regional voice and data networks; and  Highly specialized fixed and mobile military applications, such as secure communications networks and bandwidth to enable manned and unmanned aerial vehicle missions. We provide our infrastructure services on a satellite fleet comprised of over 50 satellites, covering 99% of the earths populated regions. Our satellite capacity is complemented by IntelsatONE SM , our terrestrial network comprised of leased fiber optic cable and owned and operated teleports. We believe that IntelsatONE SM provides significant differentiation and is an important element of our growth strategy. We have a reputation for operational and engineering leadership, built on our experience of over 45 years in the FSS sector. The reliability of our network is outstanding, delivering 99.9998% network availability on station-kept satellites to our customers in 2009. We built our centrally operated, fully integrated network using the worlds largest collection of FSS spectrum rights at valuable orbital locations, from which we can deliver services to established regions as well as higher-growth emerging regions. We operate in an attractive, well-developed sector of the satellite communications industry, which is benefiting from increasing demand for capacity from the commercial sector and 2 Table of Contents governments. The FSS sector is characterized by steady and predictable contracted revenue streams, high operating margins, strong cash flows and long-term contractual commitments. We believe these sector characteristics, coupled with our cost-efficient, fully integrated operating structure and favorable tax profile, provide us with an attractive business model. As of December 31, 2009, our revenue backlog, which is our expected future revenue under existing customer contracts, was approximately $9.4 billion. We typically contract with our customers for long-term commitments of up to 15 years. Approximately 96% of this backlog relates to contracts that are non-cancelable or cancelable only upon payment of substantial termination fees. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we generated revenue of $2.5 billion, a growth rate of 6% over the combined year ended December 31, 2008. We believe that our global scale and efficient operating profile, diversified customer sets and sizeable backlog, together with the growing worldwide demand for entertainment and connectivity, provide us with a platform for success. The FSS Sector Fixed satellite services are an integral part of the global communications infrastructure. The global FSS sector is expected to generate revenues of approximately $9.6 billion in 2010 according to NSR , a leading international market research and consulting firm specializing in satellite and wireless technology and applications. Our customers use our services because of the distinct technical and economic benefits that satellite services provide for certain critical applications. Satellites provide a number of advantages over terrestrial communications systems, including the following:  Satellite beams effectively blanket service regions with bandwidth, enabling any user within a coverage area to have equal access to highly reliable bandwidth;  Efficient content distribution through the ability to broadcast high quality signals from a single location to many locations simultaneously;  The ability to extend beyond terrestrial network end points, or provide an alternative path to terrestrial infrastructure, thus avoiding points of congestion or unreliability;  Fast network deployments, with network performance easily replicated across each site regardless of geography or infrastructure, and efficient centralized control and management;  Superior end-to-end network availability as compared to the availability of terrestrial networks; and  Instant communications infrastructure for disaster recovery. There is a finite number of geostationary orbital slots in which FSS satellites can be located, and many orbital locations already hold operational satellites. The owners of these satellites operate them under coordination agreements designed to avoid interference with other operators satellites. Today, there are only three FSS operators, including us, providing global services, which is increasingly important as multinationals and governments seek a one-stop solution for obtaining global connectivity. In addition, there are a number of operators with fewer satellites that provide regional and/or national services. Intelsat is the largest of any operator in terms of rights to orbital slots in the most valuable C- and Ku-band spectrums. 3 Table of Contents We believe a number of trends are creating increasing demand for satellite services, expanding the FSS sector:  Globalization of economic activities is increasing the geographic expansion of corporations and the communications networks that support them and creating new audiences for content. Globalization also increases the communications requirements for governments supporting embassy and military applications.  Connectivity and broadband access are essential elements of infrastructure supporting the rapid economic growth of developing nations. Globally dispersed organizations are increasingly moving to satellite-based infrastructure to provide better access, reliability and control.  Proliferation of content and formats is resulting in increased bandwidth requirements as content owners seek to maximize distribution to multiple viewing audiences across multiple technologies. High definition television (HDTV), three-dimensional high definition television (3DTV), Internet distribution of traditional television programming, Internet protocol television (IPTV) and video to the handset are all examples of the expanding format and distribution requirements of media programmers.  Mobility applications , such as wireless phone services, maritime communications and aerial services, are fueling demand for bandwidth on the move. Rapid growth in cellular services for developing regions is expected to transition demand for voice only services to demand for data and video services over time, resulting in increased network bandwidth requirements. Given the low penetration of fixed-line telephone services in emerging markets and the introduction of smart phones and netbooks, Internet access in these markets may be primarily mobile. Significant technology advancements in aerial data and video services for government applications, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, also is resulting in increased demand for satellite-based bandwidth. In total, C- and Ku-band transponder service revenue in the FSS sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1% from 2010 to 2015 according to NSR . The fundamentals of the sector have consistently improved over the past few years, with continued strong demand despite the generally poor economic environment in many regions of the world. The average price per transponder for the period 2009 to 2011 forecasted by NSR in its 2009 study was approximately 12.5% higher than that forecasted for the same period in a similar study issued by NSR in 2006. Our Strategy We seek revenue growth and increased cash flows by expanding our leading FSS business in high growth regions and applications while maintaining our focus on operational discipline. Given our efficient operating structure, we believe our strategies will position us to continue to deliver high operating margins, and to generate strong cash flow and growth as our current fleet investment program is completed. The key components of our strategy include the following: Focus our core business on attractive and growing applications We have an industry-leading position in each of the customer sets served by our business. We believe our global network and regional strengths will allow us to capture new business opportunities as a result of the following: Network Services:  Growth in multinational enterprise broadband access requirements resulting from globalization; 4 Table of Contents  The continued expansion of cellular networks and voice and data growth in emerging regions with inadequate infrastructure; and  New broadband connectivity requirements for aerial and maritime applications. Media:  Content and format proliferation, such as standard definition and high definition formats, increasing the capacity needs of our programmer customers;  New and expanding direct-to-home (DTH) platforms in fast growing emerging regions; and  Programmers and broadcasters seeking new global distribution capabilities to deliver content in new regions. Government:  The need for broadband and turn-key networks for in-theatre communications;  Rapidly increasing bandwidth requirements resulting from the use of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles; and  Hosted payload opportunities as government customers increasingly seek timely and cost efficient access to space, filling capacity gaps by co-locating their space assets on commercial satellites. Optimize our space-based assets, including orbital locations and spacecraft We are conducting a significant capital expenditure fleet investment program during the five-year period from 2008 to 2012. Our program is designed to position the Intelsat satellite network to capitalize on the FSS sectors best growth opportunities globally, while providing optimal coverage to meet needs across our targeted customer sets. By the conclusion of the current investment cycle in 2012, the characteristics of our refreshed fleet are expected to include the following:  A significant increase in the proportion of high-power, land mass-focused transponders suitable for broadband and video applications, which typically command a higher price, resulting in an opportunity to increase the overall yield on our fleet;  Expanded capacity to serve our faster-growth network services and government customers, particularly in emerging markets;  Expanded capacity at our most valuable regional video distribution neighborhoods;  Reduced risk of anomalies resulting from the replacement of satellites with known health issues;  No significant increase in the total amount of station-kept transponder capacity; and  A longer average remaining useful life of our satellite fleet. Incorporate new technology into our core network to capture growth from new applications and next generation customer requirements Our global scale, diversity, collection of spectrum rights, technical expertise and fully integrated hybrid network form a strategic platform that positions us to identify and capitalize on new opportunities in satellite services. Our fleet is large and diversified by coverage, 5 Table of Contents manufacturer and age. As satellites reach the end of their service lives, we have an ongoing opportunity to refresh the technology we use to serve our customers, resulting in flexibility to address new opportunities as they are identified. Our newer assets, including IntelsatONE SM , our enhanced terrestrial network, are used to address current market requirements, allowing older assets to be redeployed to serve legacy customer applications still efficiently served by those assets. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to accommodate new business models as they are adopted by our customers. We expect to benefit from the general trend towards IP-based networking and distribution, including growing use of new media formats, as well as infrastructure applications in emerging regions. We are also investing in enhanced technology that is incorporated within IntelsatONE SM , to deliver converging video and IP content, thus expanding the services we provide to the media and telecommunications industries. We intend to continue to implement compression technologies into our ground network to reduce the bandwidth necessary for network service applications, increasing our customers efficiency and expanding our market potential, particularly in emerging regions. Finally, we intend to leverage our frequent satellite launches to offer government and other customers the ability to integrate their payloads with our spacecraft, providing fast and cost-effective access to space. Opportunistically use acquisitions and creative business structures for cost-efficient growth and attractive returns Our record of capitalizing on strategic growth opportunities through targeted acquisitions and business ventures is well established. In addition, we have demonstrated our ability to integrate acquisitions efficiently and quickly, due to our scale and our centralized satellite operations philosophy. In 2006, we completed the largest acquisition in the history of the FSS sector with our $6.4 billion acquisition of PanAmSat Holding Corporation. In recent years, we have completed other, smaller transactions involving single satellites with partners in diverse regions, such as JSAT International Inc. (JSAT) in Asia, Telenor Inma AS (Telenor) in Europe, and Convergence SPV Ltd. (Convergence Partners) in Africa. We will continue to evaluate potential asset purchases, joint ventures and creative business and financial structures that complement our global fleet, provide growth capacity and allow us to respond to customer needs.

Intelsat S.A. guarantees the notes but is under no obligation to continue such guarantee. Ranking The notes are the Issuers senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers existing and future senior unsecured debt. The notes are effectively subordinated to the Issuers existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing that indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all obligations of each of its existing and future subsidiaries. The guarantee of the notes is Intelsat S.A.s senior unsecured obligation, ranking equally in right of payment with all of Intelsat S.A.s existing and future senior unsecured debt. The guarantee will be effectively subordinated to Intelsat S.A.s existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing that indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all obligations of its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, the Issuer and its subsidiaries had approximately $14.8 billion principal amount of total third-party debt on a consolidated basis, approximately $2.4 billion of which was secured debt, and Intelsat S.A. had approximately $15.6 billion aggregate principal amount of total third-party debt on a consolidated basis, approximately $2.4 billion of which was secured debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corp, the direct borrowers under their respective senior secured credit facilities, had $247.9 million and $152.2 million (net of standby letters of credit), of availability under these senior secured credit facilities, all of which were obligations of Intelsat Sub Holdco, Intelsat Corp or their respective guarantors. Optional Redemption The Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time prior to February 15, 2013, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the make-whole premium described in the Description of the Notes section under the heading Optional Redemption. Thereafter, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of such notes at the applicable redemption prices listed in the Description of the Notes section under the heading Optional Redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 11 Table of Contents Optional Redemption After Equity Offerings At any time, which may be more than once, before February 15, 2011, the Issuer may redeem up to 35% of the outstanding notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings and capital contributions as long as:  the Issuer pays a redemption price equal to 111.25% of the principal amount of any 2017 notes redeemed, and 111.50% of the principal amount of any 2017 PIK notes redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest; and  the notes are redeemed within 90 days of completing such equity offering or of such capital contribution. Change of Control Offer If a change of control of the Issuer occurs, each holder of notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of such holders notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The Issuer might not be able to pay you the required price for notes you present to it at the time of a change of control, because:  the Issuer might not have enough funds at that time; or  the terms of the Issuers other debt may prevent it from paying. Asset Sale Proceeds If the Issuer or certain of its subsidiaries engage in asset sales, the Issuer generally must either invest the net cash proceeds from such sales in our business within a specified period of time, prepay senior or secured indebtedness or make an offer to purchase a principal amount of the notes equal to the excess net cash proceeds. The purchase price of the notes will be 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date. Certain Indenture Provisions The indenture governing the notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Issuers and certain of its subsidiaries ability to:  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified or preferred stock;  pay dividends or distributions on the Issuers ordinary shares or repurchase the Issuers ordinary shares;  make certain investments;  create liens on their assets to secure debt;  enter into transactions with affiliates; 12 Table of Contents  merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company; and  transfer and sell assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the notes in this offer. The selling securityholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of the notes in this offer. We will pay substantially all expenses in connection with the offering and the sale of the notes to the public, including legal fees and disbursements of counsel, blue sky expenses, accounting fees and filing fees, but excluding any brokerage commissions, discounts or similar charges. Risk Factors Investing in the notes involves substantial risks. See Risk Factors for a description of certain of the risks you should consider before investing in the notes. 13 Table of Contents SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA The following information is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our audited consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. As a result of the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, the financial results for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 have been presented for the Predecessor Entity for the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 and for the Successor Entity for the period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Although the effective date of the New Sponsors Acquisition was February 4, 2008, due to the immateriality of the results of operations for the period between February 1, 2008 and February 4, 2008, we have accounted for the New Sponsors Acquisition as if it had occurred on February 1, 2008 and recorded push-down accounting to reflect the acquisition of Intelsat Holdings. Our summary historical consolidated statement of operations data and cash flow data for the year ended December 31, 2007, the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 (predecessor entity), the period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 (successor entity) and the year ended December 31, 2009 (successor entity), and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2008 and 2009 have been derived from audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and are included elsewhere in this prospectus. 14 Table of Contents Predecessor Entity Successor Entity Year Ended December 31, 2007 January 1 to January 31, 2008 February 1 to December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2009 (in thousands) Consolidated Statement of Operations Data Revenue $ 2,183,079 $ 190,261 $ 2,174,640 $ 2,513,039 Operating expenses: Direct costs of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 323,557 25,683 337,466 401,826 Selling, general and administrative 238,490 18,485 182,957 259,944 Depreciation and amortization 784,120 64,157 795,663 804,037 Restructuring and transaction costs 9,258 313,102 1,926  Impairment of asset value (1)   390,444 499,100 Losses on derivative financial instruments 11,699 11,431 155,305 2,681 Total operating expenses 1,367,124 432,858 1,863,761 1,967,588 Income (loss) from operations 815,955 (242,597 ) 310,879 545,451 Interest expense, net 954,607 80,275 1,295,458 1,362,823 Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt (38,143 )  576 4,697 Other income (expense), net (137 ) 535 (11,957 ) 42,013 Loss before income taxes (176,932 ) (322,337 ) (995,960 ) (770,662 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 14,957 (10,476 ) (109,561 ) 11,399 Net loss (191,889 ) (311,861 ) (886,399 ) (782,061 ) Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest   93 369 Net loss attributable to Intelsat S.A. $ (191,889 ) $ (311,861 ) $ (886,306 ) $ (781,692) Consolidated Cash Flow Data Net cash provided by operating activities $ 557,021 $ 19,619 $ 876,143 $ 873,656 Net cash used in investing activities.

The non-cash impairment charge in 2009 relates to a further impairment of our rights to operate at orbital locations. (2) EBITDA consists of earnings before interest expense, net, loss on early extinguishment of debt, taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in the FSS sector, and we present EBITDA to enhance understanding of our operating performance. We use EBITDA as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by 15 Table of Contents differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) attributable to Intelsat S.A., determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of our operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA.

The risks described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. Risk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness, including the notes. As of December 31, 2009 (a) the Issuer and its subsidiaries had approximately $14.8 billion principal amount of total third-party indebtedness on a consolidated basis, approximately $2.4 billion of which was secured debt, and (b) Intelsat S.A. had approximately $15.6 billion principal amount of total third-party indebtedness on a consolidated basis, approximately $2.4 billion of which was secured debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corp, the direct borrowers under their respective senior secured credit facilities, had $247.9 million (net of standby letters of credit) and $152.2 million, respectively, of availability under their senior secured credit facilities, all of which were obligations of Intelsat Sub Holdco, Intelsat Corp or their respective guarantors. The indentures and credit agreements governing a substantial portion of the outstanding debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries permit each of these companies to make payments to their respective direct and indirect parent companies to fund the cash interest payments on such indebtedness, so long as no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof. In connection with the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions, we became a significantly more highly leveraged company. As part of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat Bermuda incurred substantial debt, the aggregate principal amount of which was $4.96 billion, of which $1.3 billion was used to refinance existing debt. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy obligations with respect to indebtedness, including the notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of available cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  limit flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;  limit our ability to engage in strategic transactions or implement our respective business strategies; 17 Table of Contents  limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and  place us at a disadvantage compared to any competitors that have less debt. Any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our business and our results of operations. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do. We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indentures governing our existing notes and the notes and the credit agreements governing Intelsat Sub Holdcos senior secured credit facilities and Intelsat Corps amended and restated secured credit facilities, the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreements (as defined below) and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur new indebtedness, the related risks, including those described above, could intensify. The Issuer is a holding company with no independent operations or assets. Repayment of our debt, including the notes, is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and these notes are subject to a cross-default in the event that we default on certain of our obligations. The Issuer is a holding company, and all of our satellites are owned by its indirect subsidiaries. The Issuers parent company, Intelsat S.A., is also a holding company and has outstanding indebtedness. Repayment of the Issuers indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by the Issuers subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to the Issuer, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise, which depends on compliance with certain covenants, including the requirement that each of Intelsat Jackson, Intermediate Holdco, Intelsat Corp and Intelsat Sub Holdco may pay dividends to its parent only if it can incur $1 of additional debt under the debt incurrence covenant contained in such companys debt instruments. Likewise, payment on indebtedness of Intelsat S.A. is dependent on the Issuers ability to make payments to Intelsat S.A. because Intelsat S.A. currently has no direct subsidiaries other than the Issuer and Intelsat Management LLC. The Issuers subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Issuers subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the notes, or to enable Intelsat S.A. to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including its guarantee of the notes. Each of the Issuers subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuers ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. While the indenture governing the notes limits the ability of the Issuers subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to the Issuer, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, including the notes. Additionally, the Issuer may not be able to make distributions required to service the indebtedness of its parent, Intelsat S.A. In the event that Intelsat S.A. defaults on certain of its obligations, a cross-default under the indenture governing the notes may occur. In addition, notwithstanding the fact that the Issuer will not guarantee or otherwise agree to be liable for the indebtedness of Intelsat S.A., no assurance can be given that a court or other tribunal in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding would not seek to substantively consolidate the 18 Table of Contents estates of the Issuer and Intelsat S.A. Substantive consolidation would effectively merge the assets and liabilities of affiliated entities, such as Intelsat S.A. and the Issuer, in bankruptcy so that they will be treated as though held and incurred by one entity. In the event that a bankruptcy court were to reach such a finding, the notes would no longer be structurally senior to any indebtedness of Intelsat S.A. To service our third-party indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our third-party debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Intelsat Luxembourgs and its subsidiaries estimated payment obligations with respect to their indebtedness for the twelve months ending December 31, 2010 are comprised of approximately $97.5 million of principal payments and approximately $1.0 billion of interest payments (assuming that Intelsat Luxembourg elects to pay cash interest on the 2017 PIK notes for all periods after February 2010), excluding payments related to satellite performance incentives due to satellite manufacturers. Estimated payment obligations with respect to the third-party indebtedness of Intelsat S.A. and its subsidiaries for the twelve months ending December 31, 2010, which include the payment obligations of Intelsat Luxembourg, Intelsat Corp, Intelsat Jackson, Intermediate Holdco and Intelsat Sub Holdco and their subsidiaries, are comprised of approximately $97.5 million of principal payments and approximately $1.0 billion of interest payments (assuming that Intelsat Luxembourg elects to pay cash interest on the 2017 PIK notes for all periods after February 2010), excluding payments related to satellite performance incentives due to satellite manufacturers. Intelsat Luxembourgs and its subsidiaries ability to pay interest on and principal of their notes and our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend principally upon our future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make payments on our indebtedness. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments on the notes, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the credit agreements governing Intelsat Sub Holdcos and Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities, the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreements and the indentures governing our existing notes and the notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, the New Sponsors have no obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing in the future. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including the Issuers inability to service the new notes or its other debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on Intelsat Luxembourgs and its subsidiaries ability to satisfy their obligations in respect of their respective notes. 19 Table of Contents The terms of Intelsat Sub Holdcos and Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities, the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreements, the indentures governing our existing notes and the notes and the terms of our other indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions. The credit agreements governing Intelsat Sub Holdcos and Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities, the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreements, the indentures governing our existing notes and the notes and our other outstanding indebtedness contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants imposing significant operating and financial restrictions on Intelsat Luxembourg, Intelsat S.A. and some or all of their subsidiaries, as well as on Intelsat Holding Corporation and Intelsat Corp and certain of their subsidiaries, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The senior secured credit facilities of Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corp include a financial covenant that requires the applicable borrower not to exceed a maximum senior secured leverage ratio. In addition, the senior secured credit facilities require the applicable borrower to use a portion of the proceeds of certain asset sales, in excess of a specified amount, that are not reinvested in its business to repay indebtedness under such facilities. The credit agreements governing the senior secured credit facilities, the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreements, and the indentures governing our existing notes and the notes and our other outstanding indebtedness include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of Intelsat S.A. and Intelsat Luxembourg, or their respective subsidiaries, to:  incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock;  pay dividends, or make redemptions, repurchases or distributions, with respect to ordinary shares or capital stock;  create or incur certain liens;  make certain loans or investments;  engage in mergers, acquisitions, amalgamations, asset sales and sale and leaseback transactions; and  engage in transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants in Intelsat Sub Holdcos senior secured credit facilities or Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities could result in a default under the applicable credit facilities. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the applicable credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, enforce their security interest or require us to apply all available cash to repay these borrowings. If this occurred under our senior secured credit facilities, this would result in an event of default under our existing notes and the notes and the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreements. The lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to fund further borrowings. If Intelsat Sub Holdco or Intelsat Corp were unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, 20 Table of Contents the lenders under the applicable senior secured credit facilities would have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt owed to them. If the debt under one or both of these senior secured credit facilities were to be accelerated, our assets might not be sufficient to repay such debt in full or to repay the notes and our other debt. The notes are structurally subordinated to all of the debt and liabilities of the Issuers subsidiaries and will be effectively subordinated to any secured debt. The notes are structurally subordinated to all debt and liabilities of the Issuers existing and future subsidiaries, including Intelsat Jackson, Intermediate Holdco, Intelsat Corp, and Intelsat Sub Holdco and their subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or similar proceeding relating to the Issuers subsidiaries, holders of the notes will participate with all other holders of the Issuers indebtedness in the assets remaining after the Issuers subsidiaries have paid all of their debt and liabilities. In any of these cases, the Issuers subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds to make payments to the Issuer, and holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of debt of the Issuers subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate amount of outstanding third-party debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries was approximately $14.8 billion, approximately $2.4 billion of which was secured debt. In addition, the notes are the Issuers unsecured obligations. Holders of any future secured debt of the Issuer will have claims that are prior to your claims as holders of the new notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing that other debt. Additionally, the indentures governing our existing notes and the notes, the credit agreements governing Intelsat Sub Holdcos and Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities, the New Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreement permit us and/or our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, under certain circumstances. The notes are effectively subordinated to any such additional secured debt that the Issuer or its subsidiaries may incur to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt. Value should not be assigned to the guarantee of the notes provided by Intelsat S.A. and you should not expect Intelsat S.A. to participate in making any payments in respect of the notes or the guarantee. The notes will be guaranteed by Intelsat S.A., but you should not assign any value to such guarantee. Intelsat S.A. is a holding company, the only assets of which are the shares of its direct wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intelsat S.A. is dependent for the service of its indebtedness on the ability of Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corp and their respective subsidiaries to generate cash flow and make this cash available to Intelsat S.A. by dividend, distribution, loan or otherwise. The covenants in the indenture governing the notes apply only to the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries and do not apply to any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, including Intelsat S.A. As noted elsewhere in these Risk Factors and in this prospectus, Intelsat S.A. currently has a substantial amount of indebtedness (including guarantees of subsidiary indebtedness) outstanding. Any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, including Intelsat S.A. may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, and the indenture governing the notes does not prohibit any such entity from doing so. If any additional indebtedness is incurred by Intelsat S.A., the risks of servicing the indebtedness of Intelsat S.A. will be magnified. Finally, the indenture governing the notes provides that the guarantee of Intelsat S.A. may be released at any time at our option. 21 Table of Contents The notes will not be guaranteed by any of the Issuers subsidiaries. The assets of the Issuers subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on the notes. None of the Issuers subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event that any subsidiary becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or otherwise winds up, holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available to us. Consequently, claims in respect of the notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuers subsidiaries, including trade payables, and any claims of third-party holders of preferred equity interests, if any, in the Issuers subsidiaries. The value of the guarantee of the notes by Intelsat S.A. may be limited by applicable Luxembourg law affecting the rights of creditors. Intelsat S.A., the Luxembourg parent company of the Issuer, is currently a guarantor of the obligations under the notes. Under Luxembourg insolvency law, transactions may be voided in certain circumstances including on the grounds that the transaction constituted a fraudulent preference. A transaction might also be challenged if it involved a gift by the company or a company received consideration of significantly less value than the benefit given by such company. However, a Luxembourg court generally will not intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purposes of carrying on its business and there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Under Luxembourg law, a court (if it deems appropriate) may in certain circumstances, order that, where persons were knowingly parties to the conduct of a transaction with that company and the carrying on of business of that company, with the intent of defrauding creditors of the company or any other person, or of any fraudulent purpose, such persons be held liable for damages or, depending on circumstances, without limitation for all or any debt or other liability of that company. Intelsat S.A. believes that its guarantee was not issued on terms that would amount to a transaction at less than fair value and that such guarantee was in good faith for the purposes of carrying on its business and that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transactions would benefit it. Intelsat S.A. also believed at the time of making its guarantee that it was solvent and that its guarantee would not render it insolvent. There can be no assurance, however, that the issue of the guarantee will not be challenged, or that a Luxembourg or other competent court would support the analysis described above. The guarantee of the notes by Intelsat S.A. will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without rendering the guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable laws relating to insolvency, ultra vires or similar laws or regulations affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liabilities of Intelsat S.A. under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of its other obligations. The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control. The indenture requires the Issuer to offer to repurchase some or all of the notes when certain change of control events occur. If the Issuer experiences a change of control, you will have the right to require it to repurchase your notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of your notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Many of the indentures governing our existing notes and the notes and the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreements contain similar change of control provisions. Each of Intelsat Sub Holdcos and Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities provide that a change of control constitutes an event of default. Any future credit agreement or other 22 Table of Contents agreements relating to senior indebtedness to which we become a party may contain similar provisions. If either of Intelsat Sub Holdco or Intelsat Corp experiences a change of control that triggers a default under its senior secured credit facilities, the applicable borrower could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the senior secured credit facilities. In the event that either of Intelsat Sub Holdco or Intelsat Corp, as applicable, does not obtain such a waiver or refinance the senior secured credit facilities, such default could result in amounts outstanding under its senior credit facilities being declared due and payable. In the event that the Issuer experiences a change of control that results in it having to repurchase the notes, it may not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy all of its obligations under the notes and the existing notes issued by the Issuer. In addition, the change of control covenant in the indenture governing the notes does not cover all corporate reorganizations, mergers or similar transactions and may not provide you with protection in a highly leveraged transaction. See Description of the NotesChange of Control in this prospectus. There may not be a public market for the notes. There may not be a public market for the notes. We cannot guarantee the future development or continuation of a market for the notes or the ability of holders to sell, or the price at which holders may be able to sell, their notes. The notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors. The initial purchasers of the original notes have informed us that, subject to applicable laws and regulations, they may make a market in the notes. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to do so, and any market making by them may be discontinued at any time without notice. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to whether an active trading market will develop for the notes or, if a market develops, whether it will continue. The Issuer does not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for quotation through NASDAQ. Because the non-U.S. Intelsat companies are incorporated under the laws of a country outside of the United States, and certain of their directors and officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or their directors and officers. Certain of the directors and officers of Intelsat Luxembourg, the obligor under the notes, and Intelsat S.A., a guarantor of the notes, which we collectively refer to as the non-U.S. Intelsat companies, reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or those persons in the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or those persons based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws or other laws. Uncertainty exists as to whether courts in the jurisdiction of organization of the non-U.S. Intelsat companies will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the United States, against the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or the directors or officers under the securities or other laws of that jurisdiction or entertain actions in that jurisdiction against the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or the directors or officers under the securities or other laws of that jurisdiction. 23 Table of Contents The Intelsat companies might be subject to unanticipated taxes, and a holders income on the notes might be treated as income from U.S. sources. Intelsat S.A. and its non-U.S. subsidiaries, including the Issuer, intend to conduct their operations (and believe they have conducted their operations to date) so that Intelsat S.A. and its non-U.S. subsidiaries, including the Issuer, will not be (and have not been) engaged in a trade or business within the United States, will not earn (and have not earned) income effectively connected with such a business that would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and will not be subject (and have not been subject) to significant U.S. withholding tax. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may conclude that Intelsat S.A. and/or its non-U.S. subsidiaries, including the Issuer, have engaged in a trade or business within the United States and/or have been subject to significant U.S. withholding tax. Such a determination could result in a substantial unanticipated tax liability. In addition, if the Issuer were deemed to have engaged in a U.S. trade or business, all or a portion of the interest on the notes would be treated as from U.S. sources and to the extent payable to non-U.S. holders, could be subject to withholding tax unless certain conditions are met. If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, holders of notes may receive a lesser amount for their claim than they would have been entitled to receive under the indenture governing the notes. If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) after the issuance of the notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount of the notes may be limited to an amount equal to the sum of:  the original issue price for the notes; and  that portion of the original issue discount that does not constitute unmatured interest for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. Any original issue discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute unmatured interest. Accordingly, holders of the notes under these circumstances may receive a lesser amount than they would be entitled to under the terms of the indenture governing the notes, even if sufficient funds are available. Intelsat S.A., Intelsat Luxembourg and certain of our subsidiaries are currently Luxembourg companies. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Luxembourg and in the jurisdiction of organization of any future guarantor of the notes. Your rights under the notes and the guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors rights. Luxembourg insolvency laws may adversely affect a recovery by the holders of the notes. The Issuer and Intelsat S.A. are Luxembourg companies. Luxembourg insolvency laws may make it more difficult for holders of the notes to effect a restructuring of the Issuer (or Intelsat S.A.) or to recover the amount they would have recovered in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in other jurisdictions. There are a number of different insolvency regimes under Luxembourg law. Such regimes could involve a sale of the assets of the debtor in a manner that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. Consequently, Luxembourg insolvency 24 Table of Contents laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the notes to effect a restructuring of the Issuer (or Intelsat S.A.) and could reduce their recovery in a Luxembourg insolvency proceeding. In connection with Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtors creditors on the basis of the relative claims of those creditors, and certain parties (such as secured creditors) will have special rights that may adversely affect the interests of holders of the notes. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date on which the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the Issuers (or Intelsat S.A.s) receiver to be verified by the receiver. Any dispute as to the valuation of claims will be subject to court proceedings. These verification procedures could cause the claims of holders of the notes as to principal or interest to be recognized for less than the principal amount or interest of their notes or could cause holders of the notes to recover less than they could recover in a liquidation governed by the laws of another jurisdiction. Such verification procedures could also cause payments to the holders of the notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. The 2017 notes may have been and the 2017 PIK notes were issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We intend to take the position, to the extent we are required to take a position, that the issue price of the notes is equal to the stated principal amount. However, the rules to determine issue price in the circumstances in which the original notes were offered is not entirely clear. As the original notes were sold by the initial purchasers in individually negotiated transactions, we have been unable to ascertain the first price at which a substantial amount of the original notes were sold to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. We therefore cannot with certainty determine the issue price of the notes. Consequently, it is possible that the 2017 notes were issued with original issue discount (OID). The 2017 PIK notes were issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders of notes issued with OID will be required to include the amounts representing the OID in gross income on a constant yield basis in advance of receipt of the cash payments to which such income is attributable. See TaxationU.S. Federal Income Taxation. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business We are subject to significant competition both within the FSS sector and from other providers of communications capacity, such as fiber optic cable capacity. Competition from other telecommunications providers could have a material adverse effect on our business and could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and expanding our operations as planned. We face significant competition in the FSS sector in different regions around the world. We compete against other satellite operators and against suppliers of ground-based communications capacity. The increasing availability of satellite capacity and capacity from other forms of communications technology has historically created an excess supply of telecommunications capacity in certain regions from time to time. Competition in the FSS sector lowers prices, which can reduce our operating margins and the cash available to fund our operations and service our debt obligations. In addition, there has been a trend toward consolidation of major FSS providers as customers increasingly demand more robust distribution platforms with network redundancies and worldwide reach, and we expect to face 25 Table of Contents increased competition as a result of this trend. Our direct competitors are likely to continue developing and launching satellites with greater power and more transponders, which may create satellite capacity at lower costs. In order to compete effectively, we may have to invest in similar technology. We also face challenges to our business apart from these industry trends that our competition may not face. A significant portion of our revenue has historically been derived from channel services. Since fiber optic cable capacity, when available, is at substantially lower prices than satellite capacity for the same routes, competition from fiber optic cable has resulted in a migration of our point-to-point customers from satellite to fiber optic cable on certain routes. We have experienced erosion in our revenue from point-to-point services in recent years due to the build-out of fiber optic cable capacity, and we expect this erosion to continue. Some other FSS operators have service mixes that are less dependent on point-to-point connectivity than our current service mix. Our plan to address this erosion and sustain our business includes expanding our customer base in point-to-multipoint services, such as video, and growing our managed services business. In addition, we believe that there are many companies that are seeking ways to improve the ability of existing land-based infrastructure, such as fiber optic cable, to transmit signals. Any significant improvement or increase in the amount of land-based capacity, particularly with respect to the existing fiber optic cable infrastructure and point-to-point applications, may cause our video services customers to shift their transmissions to land-based capacity or make it more difficult for us to obtain new customers. If fiber optic cable networks or other ground-based high-capacity transmission systems are available to service a particular point, that capacity, when available, is generally less expensive than satellite capacity. As land-based telecommunications services expand, demand for some satellite-based services may be reduced. Failure to compete effectively with other FSS operators and to adapt to new competition and new technologies or failure to implement our business strategy while maintaining our existing business would result in a loss of revenue and a decline in profitability, a decrease in the value of our business and a downgrade of our credit ratings, which would restrict our access to the capital markets. The market for fixed satellite services may not grow or may shrink and therefore we may not be able to attract new customers, retain our existing customers or implement our strategies to grow our business. In addition, pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on FSS sector revenue. The FSS sector, as a whole, is currently expected to experience moderate growth over the next few years. However, the market for fixed satellite services may not grow or may shrink. Competing technologies, such as fiber optic cable, are continuing to adversely affect the point-to- point segment of the FSS sector. In the point-to-multipoint segment, the global economic downturn, the transition of video traffic from analog to digital and continuing improvements in compression technology have negatively impacted demand for certain fixed satellite services. Developments that we expect to support the growth of the satellite services industry, such as continued growth in data traffic and the proliferation of HDTV and niche programming, may fail to materialize or may not occur in the manner or to the extent we anticipate. Any of these industry dynamics could negatively affect our operations and financial condition. Because the market for fixed satellite services may not grow or may shrink, we may not be able to attract customers for the managed services that we are providing as part of our strategy to sustain our business. Reduced growth in the FSS sector may also adversely affect our ability 26 Table of Contents to retain our existing customers. A shrinking market could reduce the number and value of our customer contracts and would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, there could be a substantial negative impact on our credit ratings and our ability to access the capital markets. The FSS sector has in the past decade experienced periods of pricing pressures that have resulted in reduced revenues of FSS operators. If similar pricing pressures were to occur in the future, this could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and financial condition. Our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a satellite loss that is not adequately covered by insurance. We currently carry in-orbit insurance only with respect to a small portion of our satellite fleet. As our satellite insurance policies expire, we may elect to reduce or eliminate insurance coverage relating to certain of our satellites to the extent permitted by our debt agreements if, in our view, exclusions make such policies ineffective or the costs of coverage make such insurance impractical and we believe that we can more reasonably protect our business through the use of in-orbit spare satellites, backup transponders and self-insurance. A partial or complete failure of a revenue-producing satellite, whether insured or not, could require additional, unplanned capital expenditures, an acceleration of planned capital expenditures, interruptions in service, a reduction in contracted backlog and lost revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also maintain third-party liability insurance on certain of our satellites. This insurance, however, may not be adequate or available to cover all third-party liability damages that may be caused by any of our satellites, and we may not in the future be able to renew our third-party liability coverage on reasonable terms and conditions, if at all. We have several large customers and the loss of, or default by, any one of them could materially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business. We rely on a limited number of customers to provide a substantial portion of our revenue and contracted backlog. For the predecessor year ended December 31, 2007, the combined year ended December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, our ten largest customers and their affiliates represented approximately 23%, 20% and 20% of our revenue, respectively. The loss of, or default by, one or more of these customers could significantly affect our revenue and operating margins. Some customers have in the past defaulted and, although we monitor our larger customers financial performance and seek deposits, guarantees and other methods of protection against default where possible, our customers may in the future default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Defaults by any of our larger customers or by a group of smaller customers who, collectively, represent a significant portion of our revenue could adversely affect our revenue, operating margins and cash flows. If our backlog is reduced due to the financial difficulties of our customers, our revenue and operating margins would be further negatively impacted. The recent global recession may have significant effects on our customers and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The recent global recession, as well as a slow recovery period, may lead to lower demand for our services, increased incidences of our customers inability to pay for our services, or the insolvency of our customers. In addition, if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, 27 Table of Contents selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses profitably, they may raise prices, lower production levels or cease operations. For instance, one of our launch service providers filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Any of these events may negatively impact our sales, revenue generation and margins, and consequently adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business is capital intensive, and we may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate our business. Implementation of our business strategy requires a substantial outlay of capital. As we pursue our business strategies and seek to respond to opportunities and trends in our industry, our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future. We currently expect that the majority of our liquidity requirements in 2010 will be satisfied by cash on hand, cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. However, if we determine we need to obtain additional funds through external financing and are unable to do so, we may be prevented from fully implementing our business strategy. The availability and cost to us of external financing depend on a number of factors, including general market conditions, our financial performance and our credit rating. Both our credit rating and our ability to obtain financing generally may be influenced by the supply and demand characteristics of the telecommunications sector in general and of the FSS sector in particular. Declines in our expected future revenue under contracts with customers and challenging business conditions faced by our customers are among factors that may adversely affect our credit. Other factors that could impact our credit include the amount of debt in our current capital structure, activities associated with our strategic initiatives, our expected future cash flows and the capital expenditures required to execute our business strategy. The overall impact on our financial condition of any transaction that we pursue may be negative or may be negatively perceived by the financial markets and ratings agencies and may result in adverse rating agency actions with respect to our credit rating. A disruption in the capital markets, a deterioration in our financial performance or a credit rating downgrade could limit our ability to obtain financing or could result in any such financing being available only at greater cost or on more restrictive terms than might otherwise be available. Our credit rating was downgraded by Moodys Investor Services Inc. in June 2006, in January 2008, in February 2009 and again in October 2009 and by Standard & Poors Ratings Group (S&P), in June 2006, June 2007, February 2008 (but only with respect to one tranche of our debt) and again in October 2009. Our debt agreements also impose restrictions on our operation of our business and could make it more difficult for us to obtain further external financing if required. See Risk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness and the NotesThe terms of Intelsat Sub Holdcos and Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities, the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreements, the indentures governing our existing notes and the notes and the terms of our other indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions. Long-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty due to the recent global recession, changing or increased regulation or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to capital. If financial market disruptions intensify it may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital or refinance debt when needed, on acceptable terms or at all. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating other discretionary uses of cash. 28 Table of Contents We may become subject to unanticipated tax liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Intelsat S.A. and certain of its subsidiaries are Luxembourg-based companies and are subject to Luxembourg taxation for corporations. We believe that a significant portion of the income derived from our communications network will not be subject to tax in Luxembourg, or in other countries in which we conduct activities or in which our customers are located, including the United States and the United Kingdom. However, this belief is based on the anticipated nature and conduct of our business, which may change. It is also based on our current position under the tax laws of the countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. This position is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law that may have a retroactive effect. For example, Intelsat S.A. and its non-U.S. subsidiaries intend to conduct their operations (and believe they have conducted their operations to date) so that Intelsat S.A. and its non-U.S. subsidiaries will not be (and have not been) engaged in a trade or business within the United States, will not earn (and have not earned) income effectively connected with such a business that would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and will not be subject (and have not been subject) to significant U.S. withholding tax. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may conclude that Intelsat S.A. and/or its non-U.S. subsidiaries have engaged in a trade or business within the United States and/or have been subject to significant U.S. withholding tax. Such a determination could result in a substantial unanticipated tax liability for us. In addition, legislation is proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, relating to changes in laws which, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In December 2006, the U.S. Department of the Treasury finalized regulations with respect to the source of international and other types of communications income. The regulations as adopted may, under certain circumstances, subject us to U.S. withholding tax on a significant portion of our income, possibly even if we are not found to have engaged in a trade or business within the United States or to have had an office or other fixed place of business in the United States. We conduct business with customers and counterparties in multiple countries and jurisdictions. Our overall tax burden is affected by tax legislation in these jurisdictions and the terms of income tax treaties between these countries and the countries in which our subsidiaries are qualified residents for treaty purposes as in effect from time to time. Tax legislation in these countries and jurisdictions may be amended and treaties are regularly renegotiated by the contracting countries and, in each case, may change. If tax legislation or treaties were to change, we could become subject to additional taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The extent to which certain taxing jurisdictions may require us to pay tax or to make payments in lieu of tax cannot be determined in advance. In addition, our operations and payments due to us may be affected by changes in taxation, including retroactive tax claims or assessments of withholding on amounts payable to us or other taxes assessed at the source, in excess of the taxation we anticipate based on business contacts and practices and the current tax regimes. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we become subject to a significant amount of unanticipated tax liabilities. We are subject to political, economic and other risks due to the international nature of our operations. We provide communications services in approximately 200 countries and territories. Accordingly, we may be subject to greater risks than other satellite operators as a result of the international nature of our business operations. We could be harmed financially and 29 Table of Contents operationally by tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers that may be imposed on our services, or by political and economic instability in the countries in which we provide service. If we ever need to pursue legal remedies against our customers or our business partners located outside of Luxembourg, the United States or the United Kingdom, it may be difficult for us to enforce our rights against them. Almost all of our customers pay for our services in U.S. dollars, although we are exposed to some risk related to customers who do not pay in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of non-U.S. currencies may make payment in U.S. dollars more expensive for our non-U.S. customers. In addition, our non-U.S. customers may have difficulty obtaining U.S. currency and/or remitting payment due to currency exchange controls. Our New Sponsors control us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future. Intelsat Global is controlled by affiliates of the New Sponsors and the funds advised by or associated with the New Sponsors. The New Sponsors, together with certain members of our senior management team and other designated employees, beneficially own substantially all of the equity interests in Intelsat Global, which is the direct parent of Intelsat Global Subsidiary, which is the direct parent of Intelsat Holdings, which is the direct parent of Intelsat S.A. The New Sponsors also own a portion of the outstanding notes issued by Intelsat Luxembourg. The New Sponsors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders. For example, the New Sponsors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness. Additionally, the New Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The New Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the New Sponsors continue to own a significant amount of the equity of Intelsat Global, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. We may not be able to complete strategic transactions, which may prevent us from implementing strategies to grow our business. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue strategic transactions that can, among other things, broaden our customer base, provide enhanced geographic presence and provide complementary technical and commercial capabilities. Successful completion of any strategic transaction we identify depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, we may need to finance any strategic transaction that we identify, and may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on satisfactory terms and within the timeframe that would permit a transaction to proceed. We may also fail to discover liabilities of a business or operating or other problems prior to completing a transaction. We could experience adverse accounting and financial consequences, such as the need to make large provisions against the acquired assets or to write down the acquired assets. We might also experience a dilutive effect on our earnings. In addition, depending on how any such transaction is structured, there may be an adverse impact on our capital structure. We may incur significant costs arising from our efforts to engage in strategic transactions, and such costs may exceed the returns that we realize from a given transaction. Moreover, these expenditures may not result in the successful completion of a transaction. 30 Table of Contents We could be prevented from, or significantly delayed in, achieving our strategic goals if we are unable to complete strategic transactions or to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our business. Any strategic transactions that we do complete may not promote our business strategy, may negatively affect the value of our business or may adversely affect our prospects for long-term growth. Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry We may experience in-orbit satellite failures or degradations in performance that could impair the commercial performance of our satellites, which could lead to lost revenue, an increase in our cash operating expenses, lower operating income or lost backlog. Satellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and, accordingly, are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, that have occurred in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of:  the satellite manufacturers error, whether due to the use of new and largely unproven technology or due to a design, manufacturing or assembly defect that was not discovered before launch;  problems with the power systems of the satellites, including:  circuit failures or other array degradation causing reductions in the power output of the solar arrays on the satellites, which could require us to forego the use of some transponders initially and to turn off additional transponders in later years; and/or  failure of the cells within the batteries, whose sole purpose is to power the payload and spacecraft operations during the daily eclipse periods which occur for brief periods of time during two 40-day periods around March 21 and September 21 of each year; and  problems with the control systems of the satellites, including:  failure of the primary and/or backup spacecraft control processor (SCP); and  failure of the XIPS used on certain Boeing satellites, which is an electronic propulsion system that maintains the spacecrafts proper in-orbit position; and/or  general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh space environment, such as premature component failure or wear out. We have experienced anomalies in each of the categories described above. Although we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of these anomalies in new satellites and provide for on-satellite backups for certain critical components to minimize or eliminate service disruptions in the event of failure, we may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components. These anomalies can manifest themselves in scale from minor reductions of equipment redundancy to marginal reductions in capacity to complete satellite failure. Some of our satellites have experienced significant anomalies in the past and some have components that are now known to be susceptible to similar significant anomalies. Each of these is discussed in BusinessSatellite Health and Technology. An on-satellite backup for certain components may not be available upon the occurrence of such an anomaly. 31 Table of Contents Any single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our operations, our revenues, our relationship with our current customers and our ability to attract new customers for our satellite services. In particular, future anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group of transponders on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly and the availability of on-satellite backups. Anomalies and our estimate of their future effect may also cause a reduction of the expected service life of a satellite and contracted backlog. Anomalies may also cause a reduction of the revenue generated by that satellite or the recognition of an impairment loss. Finally, the occurrence of anomalies may adversely affect our ability to insure our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all. While some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others are not or may not be covered. See Risk Factors Relating to Our BusinessOur financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a satellite loss that is not adequately covered by insurance. Many of the technical problems we have experienced with our current fleet have been component failures and anomalies. Our IS-804 satellite experienced a sudden and unexpected electrical power system anomaly that resulted in the total loss of the satellite in January 2005. The IS-804 satellite was a Lockheed Martin 7000 series (LM 7000 series) satellite, and we operate three other satellites in the LM 7000 series, the IS-801, IS-802 and IS-805 satellites. We believe that the IS-804 satellite failure was most likely caused by a high current event in the battery circuitry triggered by an electrostatic discharge that propagated to cause the sudden failure of the high voltage power system. Our IS-802 satellite experienced a reduction of electrical power capability that resulted in a degraded capability of the satellite in September 2006. A significant subset of transponders on IS-802 were subsequently reactivated and are operating normally. We believe that the IS-802 anomaly was most likely caused by an electrical short internal to the solar array harness located on the south solar array boom. Our Galaxy 26 and Galaxy 27 satellites experienced sudden anomalies in their electrical distribution systems that resulted in the loss of control of the satellites and the interruption of customer services on the satellites in November 2004 and June 2008, respectively. We believe the likely root cause of the anomalies is a design flaw that is affected by a number of parameters and in some extreme cases can result in an electrical system anomaly. This design flaw exists on three of our satellites, Galaxy 27, Galaxy 26 and IS-8. We may also experience additional anomalies relating to the failure of the SCP in certain of our BSS 601 satellites, various anomalies associated with XIPS in our BSS 601 HP satellites or a progressive degradation of the solar arrays in certain of our BSS 702 satellites. Three of the BSS 601 satellites that we operated in the past, as well as BSS 601 satellites operated by others, have experienced a failure of the primary and backup SCPs. On January 15, 2006, our Galaxy 3R satellite experienced an anomaly of its back-up SCP and was taken out of service. On February 1, 2010 our IS-4 satellite experienced an anomaly of its backup SCP and was taken out of service. These events did not have a material impact on our operations or financial results. Certain of the BSS 601 HP satellites have experienced various problems associated with their XIPS. We currently operate four satellites of this type, two of which have experienced failures of both XIPS. We may in the future experience similar problems associated with XIPS or other propulsion systems on our satellites. 32 Table of Contents Two of the three BSS 702 satellites that we operate, as well as BSS 702s of a similar design operated by others, have experienced a progressive degradation of their solar arrays causing a reduction in output power. Along with the manufacturer, we continually monitor the problem to determine its cause and its expected effect. The power reduction may require us to permanently turn off certain transponders on the affected satellites to allow for the continued operation of other transponders, which could result in a loss of revenues, or may result in a reduction of the satellites service life. In 2004, based on a review of available data, we reduced our estimate of the service lives of both satellites due to the continued degradation. We may experience a launch failure or other satellite damage or destruction during launch, which could result in a total or partial satellite loss. A new satellite could also fail to achieve its designated orbital location after launch. Any such loss of a satellite could negatively impact our business plans and could reduce our revenue. Satellites are subject to certain risks related to failed launches. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take 24 months or longer, and to obtain other launch opportunities. Such significant delays could materially and adversely affect our operations and our revenue. In addition, significant delays could give customers who have purchased or reserved capacity on that satellite a right to terminate their service contracts relating to the satellite. We may not be able to accommodate affected customers on other satellites until a replacement satellite is available. A customers termination of its service contracts with us as a result of a launch failure would reduce our contracted backlog. Delay caused by launch failures may also preclude us from pursuing new business opportunities and undermine our ability to implement our business strategy. Launch vehicles may also under-perform, in which case the satellite may still be placed into service by using its onboard propulsion systems to reach the desired orbital location, resulting in a reduction in its service life. In addition, although we have had launch insurance on all of our launches to date, if we were not able to obtain launch insurance on reasonable terms and a launch failure were to occur, we would directly suffer the loss of the cost of the satellite and related costs, which could be more than $250 million. Since 1975, we and the entities we have acquired have launched 106 satellites. Eight of these satellites were destroyed as a result of launch failures. In addition, certain launch vehicles that we have used or are scheduled to use have experienced launch failures in the past. Launch failure rates vary according to the launch vehicle used. New or proposed satellites are subject to construction and launch delays, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations. The construction and launch of satellites are subject to certain delays. Such delays can result from the delays in the construction of satellites and launch vehicles, the periodic unavailability of reliable launch opportunities, possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and launch failures. We have in the past experienced delays in satellite construction and launch which have adversely affected our operations. Future delays may have the same effect. A significant delay in the future delivery of any satellite may also adversely affect our marketing plan for the satellite. If satellite construction schedules are not met, a launch opportunity may not be available at the time a satellite is ready to be launched. Further, any significant delay in the commencement of service of any of our satellites could enable customers who pre-purchased or agreed to utilize transponder capacity on the satellite to terminate their contracts and could affect our plans to replace an in-orbit satellite prior to the end of its service life. The failure to implement our satellite deployment plan on 33 Table of Contents schedule could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Delays in the launch of a satellite intended to replace an existing satellite that results in the existing satellite reaching its end of life before being replaced could result in loss of business to the extent an in-orbit backup is not available. Our dependence on outside contractors could result in increased costs and delays related to the launch of our new satellites, which would in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. There are a limited number of companies that we are able to use to launch our satellites and a limited number of commercial satellite launch opportunities available in any given time period. Adverse events with respect to our launch service providers, such as satellite launch failures, could result in increased costs or delays in the launch of our satellites. General economic conditions may also affect the ability of launch providers to provide launch services on commercially reasonable terms or to fulfill their obligations in terms of launch dates, pricing, or both. In the event that our launch service providers are unable to fulfill their obligations, we may have difficulty procuring alternative services in a timely manner and may incur significant additional expenses as a result. Any such increased costs and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. One of our launch service providers, Sea Launch Company L.L.C. (Sea Launch), with which we have contracted for the future launch of one satellite and have options for the launch of four additional satellites, has filed a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $43 million outstanding of payments made to Sea Launch relating to satellite launches that Sea Launch is still required to provide us. While Sea Launch is continuing to operate as a debtor-in-possession, and while we may receive full or partial credit for prior payments relating to the launches, there can be no assurance that Sea Launch will honor its contractual obligations to us, or do so without charging us significant additional amounts beyond what is provided for in our current agreements. In addition, should we try to procure alternative launch services for the satellites involved, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant delays and significant additional expenses as a result. Risk Factors Relating to Regulation We are subject to regulatory and licensing requirements in each of the countries in which we provide services, and our business is sensitive to regulatory changes in those countries. The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and in connection with providing satellite capacity, ground network uplinks, downlinks and other value-added services to our customers, we need to maintain regulatory approvals, and from time to time obtain new regulatory approvals, from various countries. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals can involve significant time and expense. If we cannot obtain or are delayed in obtaining the required regulatory approvals, we may not be able to provide these services to our customers or expand into new services. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject could change at any time, thus making it more difficult for us to obtain new regulatory approvals or causing our existing approvals to be revoked or adversely modified. Because the regulatory schemes vary by country, we may also be subject to regulations of which we are not presently aware and could be subject to sanctions by a foreign government that could materially and adversely affect our operations in that country. If we cannot comply with the laws and regulations that apply to us, we could lose our revenue from services provided to the countries and territories covered by these laws and regulations and be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. 34 Table of Contents If we do not maintain regulatory authorizations for our existing satellites and associated ground facilities or obtain authorizations for our future satellites and associated ground facilities, we may not be able to operate our existing satellites or expand our operations. Our operation of existing satellites is authorized and regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the U.K. Office of Communications, the telecommunications licensing authority in Papua New Guinea, the telecommunications ministry of Japan, and the regulatory agency of Germany. If we do not maintain authorizations for our existing satellites, we would not be able to operate the satellites covered by those authorizations, unless we obtained authorization from another licensing jurisdiction. Some of our authorizations provide waivers of technical regulations. If we do not maintain these waivers, we would be subject to operational restrictions or interference that would affect our use of existing satellites. Loss of a satellite authorization could cause us to lose the revenue from services provided by that satellite at a particular orbital location to the extent these services cannot be provided by satellites at other orbital locations. Our launch and operation of planned satellites require additional regulatory authorizations from the FCC or a non-U.S. licensing jurisdiction, some of which we have already obtained. If we do not obtain any required authorizations in the future, we would not be able to operate our planned satellites. If we obtain a required authorization but we do not meet milestones regarding the construction, launch and operation of a satellite by deadlines that may be established in the authorization, we could lose our authorization to operate a satellite using certain frequencies in an orbital location. Any authorizations we obtain may also impose operational restrictions or permit interference that could affect our use of planned satellites. If we do not occupy unused orbital locations by specified deadlines, or do not maintain satellites in orbital locations we currently use, those orbital locations may become available for other satellite operators to use. Our in-orbit satellites do not currently occupy all of the orbital locations for which we have obtained regulatory authorizations. If we are unable to place satellites into currently unused orbital locations by specified deadlines and in a manner that satisfies the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), or national regulatory requirements, or if we are unable to maintain satellites at the orbital locations that we currently use, we may lose our rights to use these orbital locations and the locations could become available for other satellite operators to use. We cannot operate our satellites without a sufficient number of suitable orbital locations in which to place the satellites. The loss of one or more of our orbital locations could negatively affect our plans and our ability to implement our business strategy. Coordination results may adversely affect our ability to use a satellite at a given orbital location for our proposed service or coverage area. We are required to record frequencies and orbital locations used by our satellites with the ITU and to coordinate the use of these frequencies and orbital locations in order to avoid interference to or from other satellites. The results of coordination may adversely affect our use of satellites at particular orbital locations. If we are unable to coordinate our satellites by specified deadlines, we may not be able to use a satellite at a given orbital location for our proposed service or coverage area. The use of our satellites may also be temporarily or permanently adversely affected if the operation of adjacent satellite networks does not conform to coordination agreements resulting in the acceptable interference levels being exceeded (e.g., due to operational errors associated with the transmissions to adjacent satellite networks). 35 Table of Contents Our failure to maintain or obtain authorizations under the U.S. export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. The export of satellites and technical information related to satellites, earth station equipment and provision of services to certain countries are subject to State Department, Commerce Department and Treasury Department regulations. If we do not maintain our existing authorizations or obtain necessary future authorizations under the export control laws and regulations of the United States, we may be unable to export technical information or equipment to non-U.S. persons and companies, including to our own non-U.S. employees, as required to fulfill existing contracts. If we do not maintain our existing authorizations or obtain necessary future authorizations under the trade sanctions laws and regulations of the United States, we may not be able to provide satellite capacity and related administrative services to certain countries subject to U.S. sanctions. In addition, because we conduct management activities from Luxembourg, our U.S. suppliers must comply with U.S. export control laws and regulations in connection with their export of satellites and related equipment and technical information to us. Our ability to acquire new satellites, launch new satellites or operate our satellites could also be negatively affected if our suppliers do not obtain required U.S. export authorizations. If we do not maintain required security clearances from, and comply with our agreements with, the U.S. Department of Defense, we will not be able to continue to perform our obligations under classified U.S. government contracts. To participate in classified U.S. government programs, we sought and obtained security clearances for one of our subsidiaries from the U.S. Department of Defense as required under the national security laws and regulations of the United States by entering into a proxy agreement with the U.S. government. If we do not maintain these security clearances, we will not be able to perform our obligations under any classified U.S. government contracts to which our subsidiary is a party, the U.S. government would have the right to terminate our contracts requiring access to classified information and we will not be able to enter into new classified contracts. As a result, our business could be materially adversely affected. Further, if we materially violate the terms of the proxy agreement, which limits our ability to control the operations of this subsidiary, the subsidiary holding the security clearances may be suspended or debarred from performing any government contracts, whether classified or unclassified. 36 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the statements in this prospectus constitute forward-looking statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts.

In addition, certain of the directors and officers of the non-U.S. Intelsat companies reside outside of the United States and most of the assets of the non-U.S. Intelsat companies and some of the assets of their directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or those persons in the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or those persons based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws or other laws. Uncertainty exists as to whether courts in the jurisdiction of organization of the non-U.S. Intelsat companies will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the United States, against the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or their directors or officers under the securities or other laws of that jurisdiction or entertain actions in that jurisdiction against the non-U.S. Intelsat companies or their directors or officers under the securities or other laws of that jurisdiction. USE OF PROCEEDS We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the notes in this offer. The selling securityholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of the notes in this offer. We will pay substantially all expenses in connection with the offering and the sale of the notes to the public, including legal fees and disbursements of counsel, blue sky expenses, accounting fees and filing fees, but excluding any brokerage commissions, discounts or similar charges. 39 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our capitalization as of December 31, 2009 on an actual basis.

As a result of the consummation of the 2005 Acquisition Transactions (as defined in BusinessOur HistoryThe 2005 Acquisition Transactions), the financial results for 2005 have been separately presented for the Predecessor Entity for the period January 1, 2005 through January 31, 2005 and for the Successor Entity for the periods February 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005 and February 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005. Although the effective date of the 2005 Acquisition Transactions was January 28, 2005, due to the immateriality of the results of operations for the period between January 28, 2005 and January 31, 2005, we have accounted for the consummation of the 2005 Acquisition Transactions as if they had occurred on January 31, 2005. As a result of the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, the financial results for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 have been presented for the Predecessor Entity for the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 and for the Successor Entity for the period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Although the effective date of the New Sponsors Acquisition was February 4, 2008, due to the immateriality of the results of operations for the period between February 1, 2008 and February 4, 2008, we have accounted for the New Sponsors Acquisition as if it had occurred on February 1, 2008 and recorded push-down accounting to reflect the acquisition of Intelsat Holdings. The consolidated statement of operations data and consolidated cash flow data for the year ended December 31, 2007, the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 (predecessor entity), the period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 (successor entity) and the year ended December 31, 2009, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2008 and 2009 have been derived from consolidated financial statements audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, included elsewhere in this prospectus. The consolidated statement of operations data and consolidated cash flow data for the period January 1, 2005 to January 31, 2005 (predecessor entity), the period February 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 (predecessor entity) and the year ended December 31, 2006, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 have been derived from consolidated financial statements that are not included in this prospectus. 42 Table of Contents Predecessor Entity Predecessor Entity Successor Entity January 1 to January 31, 2005 February 1 to December 31, 2005 Year Ended December 31, January 1 to January 31, 2008 February 1 to December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2009 2006 2007 (in thousands) Consolidated Statement of Operations Data Revenue $ 97,917 $ 1,073,566 $ 1,662,666 $ 2,183,079 $ 190,261 $ 2,174,640 $2,513,039 Operating expenses: Direct costs of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 26,939 215,590 274,280 323,557 25,683 337,466 401,826 Selling, general and administrative 55,491 142,824 198,189 238,490 18,485 182,957 259,944 Depreciation and amortization 39,184 534,329 701,517 784,120 64,157 795,663 804,037 Restructuring and transaction costs 263  26,452 9,258 313,102 1,926  Impairment of asset value (1) 69,227  48,974   390,444 499,100 Losses on derivative financial instruments   11,731 11,699 11,431 155,305 2,681 Total operating expenses 191,104 892,743 1,261,143 1,367,124 432,858 1,863,761 1,967,588 Operating income (loss) from continuing operations (93,187 ) 180,823 401,523 815,955 (242,597 ) 310,879 545,451 Interest expense, net 12,024 365,418 724,141 954,607 80,275 1,295,458 1,362,823 Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt    (38,143 )  576 4,697 Other income (expense), net (115 ) (8,191 ) (27,246 ) (137 ) 535 (11,957 ) 42,013 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (105,326 ) (192,786 ) (349,864 ) (176,932 ) (322,337 ) (995,960 ) (770,662 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 4,400 22,772 18,850 14,957 (10,476 ) (109,561 ) 11,399 Net loss (109,726 ) (215,558 ) (368,714 ) (191,889 ) (311,861 ) (886,399 ) (782,061 ) Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest      93 369 Net loss attributable to Intelsat S.A. $ (109,726 ) $ (215,558 ) $ (368,714 ) $ (191,889 ) $ (311,861 ) $ (886,306 ) $ (781,692 ) Consolidated Cash Flow Data Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,384 $ 493,628 $ 448,556 $ 557,021 $ 19,619 $ 876,143 $ 873,656 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities. 37,608 (112,795 ) (3,304,607 ) (540,988 ) (24,701 ) (409,897 ) (947,095 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (475 ) (216,398 ) 3,079,761 (173,602 ) (22,304 ) (1,504,431 ) 73,001 Other Data EBITDA (2) $ (54,118 ) $ 706,961 $ 1,075,794 $ 1,599,938 $ (177,905 ) $ 1,094,678 $ 1,391,870 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges (3)        Capital expenditures $ 953 $ 132,554 $ 152,086 $ 543,612 $ 24,701 $ 397,759 $ 943,133 43 Table of Contents Predecessor Entity Successor Entity As of December 31, As of December 31, 2008 As of December 31, 2009 2005 2006 2007 (in thousands) Consolidated Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents $ 360,070 $ 583,656 $ 426,569 $ 470,211 $ 477,571 Satellites and other property and equipment, net 3,237,341 4,729,135 4,586,348 5,339,671 5,781,955 Total assets 5,294,444 12,401,408 12,053,332 17,657,332 17,342,935 Total debt 4,801,113 11,279,615 11,265,404 14,873,333 15,320,669 Shareholders equity (deficit) (206,265 ) (541,341 ) (722,384 ) 504,347 (210,763 ) (1) The non-cash impairment charge in the period January 1, 2005 to January 31, 2005 relates to the write-off of the IS-804 satellite following its in-orbit failure during January 2005. The non-cash impairment charge in 2006 relates to the write-down in value of the IS-802 satellite to its fair value after a partial loss of the satellite. The non-cash impairment charge in 2008 includes $63.6 million for the write-down in value of the Galaxy 26 satellite to its fair value after a partial loss of the satellite, as well as $326.8 million due to the impairment of our rights to operate at orbital locations. The non-cash impairment charge in 2009 relates to a further impairment of our rights to operate at orbital locations. (2) EBITDA consists of earnings before interest expense, net, loss on early extinguishment of debt, taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in the FSS sector, and we present EBITDA to enhance understanding of our operating performance. We use EBITDA as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) attributable to Intelsat S.A., determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of our operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA.

Fixed charges include interest expense (including amortization of debt issuance costs), capitalized interest and the portion of operating rental expense that our management believes is representative of the interest component of rent expense. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not presented for the periods January 1 to January 31, 2005, February 1 to December 31, 2005, the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, the periods January 1 to January 31, 2008, February 1 to December 31, 2008 or the year ended December 31, 2009 as earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges during those periods by $102.5 million, $160.3 million, $313.0 million, $201.0 million, $324.6 million, $1.0 billion and $837.6 million, respectively. 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our historical consolidated financial statements covers periods before and after the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions. This discussion should be read together with the Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, unless otherwise indicated, the other financial information contained in this prospectus has also been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of factors that could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to be different from those discussed below. Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them.

Overview Intelsat operates the worlds largest FSS business, providing a critical layer in the global communications infrastructure. We provide our infrastructure services on a satellite fleet comprised of over 50 satellites covering 99% of the earths populated regions. Our satellite capacity is complemented by IntelsatONE SM , our terrestrial network comprised of leased fiber optic cable and owned and operated teleports. We operate more satellite capacity in orbit, have more satellite capacity under contract, serve more commercial customers, deliver services in more countries and distribute more television channels than any other commercial satellite operator. Impact of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions On February 4, 2008, Serafina completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity ownership of Intelsat Holdings for total cash consideration of approximately $5.0 billion. The former shareholders of Intelsat Holdings (other than management) sold 100% of their equity interests in Intelsat Holdings. Upon closing, management contributed to Serafina Holdings the portion of their equity interests in Intelsat Holdings not purchased for cash by Serafina in exchange for equity interests in Serafina Holdings (which was renamed Intelsat Global, Ltd. on February 8, 2008). In order to finance the New Sponsors Acquisition, Serafina borrowed $4.96 billion in aggregate principal amount of term loans under a $2.81 billion senior unsecured bridge loan credit agreement, dated as of February 4, 2008 (the Senior Bridge Loan Credit Agreement) and a $2.15 billion senior unsecured payment-in-kind election bridge loan credit agreement, dated as of February 4, 2008 (the PIK Election Bridge Loan Credit Agreement and, together with the Senior Bridge Loan Credit Agreement, the Bridge Loan Credit Agreements). See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesNew Sponsors Acquisition Financing. Immediately following the New Sponsors Acquisition, Intelsat Bermuda, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, transferred certain of its assets (including all of its direct and indirect ownership interests in our subsidiaries) and certain of its liabilities and obligations to a newly formed direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Intelsat Jackson, pursuant to an assignment and 45 Table of Contents assumption agreement (the Intelsat Bermuda Transfer). Following the Intelsat Bermuda Transfer, Intelsat Jackson became the owner of substantially all of Intelsat Bermudas assets and the obligor with respect to substantially all of Intelsat Bermudas liabilities and obligations, and Intelsat Bermuda no longer had any rights or obligations with respect to such assets and liabilities. Immediately after the consummation of the Intelsat Bermuda Transfer, Serafina assigned certain of its assets and liabilities to Intelsat Bermuda (the Serafina Assignment), including Serafinas rights and obligations under the Bridge Loan Credit Agreements and a Commitment Letter, dated as of June 19, 2007, among Serafina and certain banks, related to the financing of the New Sponsors Acquisition, as amended by the Commitment Letter Amendment, dated as of February 7, 2008 (the Financing Commitment Letter). In addition, Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corporation (Intelsat Corp) entered into amendments to their respective existing senior secured credit facilities, and Intelsat Corp entered into a joinder agreement to its existing credit agreement, to facilitate the New Sponsors Acquisition. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, on February 7, 2008, Intelsat Jackson redeemed all $260.0 million of its outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and all $600.0 million of its outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2015, and on March 6, 2008, Intelsat, Ltd. redeemed all $400.0 million of its outstanding 5¼% Senior Notes due 2008. The New Sponsors Acquisition and the transactions described above are collectively referred to as the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions. Immediately upon the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition, the Intelsat Bermuda and Intelsat Sub Holdco monitoring fee agreements with the Former Sponsors (as defined below in BusinessOur HistoryThe 2005 Acquisition Transactions) were terminated. Intelsat Bermuda entered into a new monitoring fee agreement (the 2008 MFA) with BC Partners Holdings Limited and Silver Lake Management Company III, L.L.C. (together, the 2008 MFA parties), pursuant to which the 2008 MFA parties provide certain monitoring, advisory and consulting services to Intelsat Bermuda. The New Sponsors Acquisition resulted in a change of control under the indentures governing certain of our outstanding series of notes and Intelsat Jacksons Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement dated February 2, 2007, giving the holders of those notes and loans the right to require the respective issuers to repurchase such notes and the borrower to repay such loans at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase or repayment. During the second and third quarters of 2008, the relevant entities completed each such change of control offer, financing the repurchases and repayment through backstop unsecured credit agreement borrowings under the Financing Commitment Letter or with proceeds from offerings of notes and a new unsecured term loan borrowing. See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesNew Sponsors Acquisition FinancingChange of Control Offers and Liquidity and Capital ResourcesNew Sponsors Acquisition Financing2008 Debt Refinancings. In addition, all outstanding restricted performance shares under the Intelsat Holdings, Ltd. 2005 Share Incentive Plan (the 2005 Share Plan) vested upon consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition. Vesting in share-based compensation arrangements (SCAs) issued under the 2005 Share Plan doubled if the awardee was still employed on February 4, 2008. The vested SCAs were cancelled in return for cash in an amount equal to the excess of approximately $400 (the per share price of the transaction) over the exercise price of each share covered. Vested restricted shares (including time and performance vesting shares) were purchased at approximately $400 per share. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, each unvested restricted share of Intelsat Holdings was exchanged for approximately four unvested restricted shares of Intelsat Global (exchange shares) and the exchange shares continued to be classified as a liability of Intelsat Global due to certain repurchase features in the 2005 Share Plan. In addition, the original vesting periods associated with the unvested Intelsat Holdings restricted shares continued. In May 2009, the board of directors of Intelsat 46 Table of Contents Global adopted an amended and restated Intelsat Global, Ltd. 2008 Share Incentive Plan (the 2008 Share Plan), and Intelsat Global entered into new restricted share agreements with respect to the exchange shares. As a result, as of December 31, 2009, these exchange share grants were no longer subject to certain repurchase features and were instead deemed to be granted in accordance with the guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (the Codification) Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation (FASB ASC 718). In connection with the completion of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions, we recorded $313.1 million of transaction costs in our consolidated statement of operations during the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008. These costs included $197.2 million of costs associated with the repurchase or cancellation of restricted shares and SCAs of Intelsat Holdings, an advisory service fee of $60.0 million paid to the 2008 MFA parties, and $55.3 million in professional fees. The New Sponsors Acquisition was accounted for by Intelsat Holdings under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (FASB ASC 805). As a result, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition. In accordance with Topic 5J of the codified SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins, the purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down and recorded in our consolidated financial statements, which resulted in a new basis of accounting for the successor period beginning after the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition. Determining fair values required us to make significant estimates and assumptions. In order to develop estimates of fair values, we considered the following generally accepted valuation approaches: the cost approach, the income approach and the market approach. Our estimates included assumptions about projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, tax amortization periods, technology royalty rates and technology life cycles, the regulatory and legal environment, and industry and economic trends. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodologies were reasonable, different assumptions could have resulted in different market values. The purchase price allocation was finalized during the year ended December 31, 2008. 47 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue Overview We earn revenue primarily by providing services over satellite transponder capacity to our customers. Our customers generally obtain satellite capacity from us by placing an order pursuant to one of several master customer service agreements. The master customer agreements and related service orders under which we sell services specify, among other things, the amount of satellite capacity to be provided, whether service will be non-preemptible or preemptible and the service term. Most services are full time in nature, with service terms ranging from one year to as long as 15 years. Occasional use services used for video applications can be for much shorter periods, including increments of one hour. Our master customer service agreements offer different service types, including transponder services, managed services, and channel, which are all services that are provided on, or used to provide access to, our global network. Our customer agreements also cover services from third parties, or mobile satellite services, that can include transponder services and mobile satellite services (MSS). The following table describes our primary service types: Service Type Description Transponder Services  Commitments by customers to receive service via, or to utilize capacity on particular designated transponders according to specified technical and commercial terms. Managed Services  Hybrid services based upon IntelsatONE SM , which combine satellite capacity, teleport facilities, satellite communications hardware and fiber optic cable and other ground facilities to provide managed and monitored broadband, Internet, video and private network services to customers. Mobile Satellite Services and Other  Voice, data and video services provided by third-party commercial satellite operators for which the desired frequency type or geographic coverage is not available on our network, which we refer to as off-network. These services include mobile satellite services, for which our Intelsat General business is a reseller. This category also includes revenue for a number of satellite-related consulting and technical services that involve the lifecycle of satellite operations and related infrastructure, from satellite and launch vehicle procurement through tracking, telemetry and control (TT&C) services and related equipment sales. Channel  Commitments by customers to purchase an overall amount or level of service, without committing to particular designated transponders for specified terms within the commitment period. Services are offered off the shelf, so technical terms are not specially tailored to a given customer. Channel is not considered a core service offering due to changing market requirements and the proliferation of fiber alternatives for point-to-point customer applications. 48 Table of Contents We market our services on a global basis, with almost every populated region of the world contributing to our revenue. The diversity of our revenue allows us to benefit from changing market conditions and lowers our risk from revenue fluctuations in our service applications and geographic regions. Trends Impacting Our Revenue Our revenue at any given time is partially dependent on the supply of communications capacity available in a geographic region, including capacity from other satellite providers and from competing technologies such as fiber optic cable networks, as well as the level of demand for that capacity. See BusinessThe FSS Sector for a discussion of the global trends creating demand for our services. In recent years, we have generated new revenue from a number of sources, including on our global network from growth in demand for transponder services for network services applications such as network extensions for cellular phone operators and satellite-based private data networks and managed services for Internet backbone access and corporate broadband networks. We have also experienced growth in demand for transponder services for use in video applications such as HDTV services and DTH television services. New transponder services and managed services revenue has also been generated from demand for government applications, such as support for military operations. Growth in demand for mobile satellite services, generally from demand from our government customers for spectrum or regional coverage unavailable on our network, has also resulted in new revenue. Although margins for these mobile satellite services are typically substantially lower than for services provided on our network, our mobile satellite services are low risk in nature, with the terms and conditions of the procured capacity typically matched to contractual commitments from our customers. See BusinessOur Customer Sets for a discussion of our customers uses of our services and see BusinessOur Strategy for a discussion of our strategies with respect to marketing to our various customer sets. Customer Applications Our transponder services, managed services, mobile satellite services and channel are used by our customers for three primary customer applications: network service applications, media applications and government applications. Pricing We believe that the flexibility that we have to help our customers optimize their services and in pricing services for new capacity in certain regions has positively affected our revenue. Although the pricing of our services is generally fixed for the duration of existing service commitments, new and renewing service commitments are priced competitively to reflect regional demand and other factors, subject to the contractual restrictions noted in the paragraph below. We believe that this flexibility in pricing our services will continue to positively affect our revenue from certain geographic regions. Over the last three years, we experienced improving pricing trends in most of the regions we serve, including in North America, Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. We are subject to contractual restrictions that constrain our ability to price services according to market rates in some limited circumstances. These contractual restrictions include the lifeline connectivity obligation (LCO) protection provisions described in BusinessCertain Customer Service Agreements. 49 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Direct Costs of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) Direct costs of revenue relate to costs associated with the operation and control of our satellites, our communications network and engineering support and consist principally of salaries and related employment costs, in-orbit insurance, earth station operating costs and facilities costs. Our direct costs of revenue fluctuate based on the number and type of services offered and under development. Direct costs of revenue have increased due to our expanded sales of mobile satellite services to customers of our Intelsat General business and due to launch vehicle costs related to satellite-related services. We expect our direct costs of revenue to increase as we add customers and expand our IntelsatONE SM managed services and mobile satellite services. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses relate to costs associated with our sales and marketing staff and our administrative staff, which includes legal, finance and human resources. Staff expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employment costs including stock compensation, travel costs and office occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include building maintenance and rent expenses and the provision for uncollectible accounts. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include fees for professional services and fees payable to the New Sponsors and related parties in support of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions and other strategic activities, which have been significant in recent periods due to the high level of transaction activity. Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate with the number of customers served and the number and types of services offered. Depreciation and Amortization Our capital assets consist primarily of our satellites and associated ground network infrastructure. Included in capitalized satellite costs are the costs for satellite construction, satellite launch services, insurance premiums for satellite launch and the in-orbit testing period, the net present value of deferred satellite performance incentives payable to satellite manufacturers, and capitalized interest incurred during the satellite construction period. Capital assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The remaining depreciable lives of our satellites range from less than one year to 16 years. As a result of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions, our depreciation and amortization costs have increased, principally due to depreciation costs we incurred on satellites and the amortization of intangible assets primarily due to increases in fair values as a result of purchase accounting. Impairment Charges We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $63.6 million during the second quarter of 2008 related to the write-down of the Galaxy 26 satellite to its fair value after a partial loss of the satellite. We also recorded $326.8 million in non-cash impairment charges in connection with our 2008 annual impairment assessment of our orbital locations. During the first quarter of 2009, the credit markets continued to experience difficulties, with new debt issuances being priced at significantly higher effective interest rates as compared to the pricing of debt issuances completed in prior periods. The higher effective interest rates reflected, in our view, higher discounts being applied in the valuation of companies generally, and were therefore 50 Table of Contents considered by us to be an indicator of potential impairment to the fair value of our right to operate at orbital locations. The higher interest rates resulted in an increase to our weighted average cost of capital, and led to our recognizing a non-cash impairment charge of $499.1 million in the first quarter of 2009. See Critical Accounting PoliciesAsset Impairment Assessments. Backlog We benefit from strong visibility of our future revenues. Our backlog, which is our expected future revenue under all our customer contracts, but includes only our pro rata share of backlog of our joint venture investments, was approximately $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average remaining customer contract life was approximately 4.7 years. We currently expect to deliver services associated with approximately $2.1 billion, or approximately 22%, of our December 31, 2009 backlog during the year ending December 31, 2010. Based on our backlog at December 31, 2009, we expect to recognize at least $105.9 million in channel applications revenue over the next twelve months. The amount included in backlog represents the full service charge for the duration of the contract and does not include termination fees. As of December 31, 2009, 96% of our total backlog related to contracts that either were non-cancellable or had substantial termination fees. In certain cases of breach for non-payment or customer bankruptcy, we may not be able to recover the full value of certain contracts or termination fees. Our expected future revenue under contractual backlog as of December 31, 2009 was as follows (in millions): Period 2010 $ 2,073.3 2011 1,514.6 2012 1,165.6 2013 952.9 2014 759.8 2015 and thereafter 2,950.5 Total $ 9,416.7 Our backlog by service type as of December 31, 2009 was as follows (in millions, except percentages): Service Type Amount Percent Transponder services $ 8,073.5 86 % Managed services 465.8 5 Mobile satellite services and other 455.0 5 Channel 422.4 4 Total $ 9,416.7 100 % We believe this backlog and the resulting predictable cash flows in the FSS sector reduce the volatility of our net cash provided by operating activities more than would be typical for a company outside our industry. 51 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 As a result of the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, the financial results for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 have been separately presented for the predecessor entity for the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 and for the successor entity for the period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. As such, the reported results of operations for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 are not necessarily comparable to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to interest expense resulting from the acquisition financing and depreciation and amortization costs principally due to the fair value adjustments to long-lived assets in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. For comparative purposes, we combined the periods from January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 and February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 in our discussion below, as we believe this combination is useful to provide the reader a year-over-year comparison for purposes of understanding our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe this combination of results for the predecessor entity and successor entity periods facilitates an investors understanding of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the combined year ended December 31, 2008. However, this combination is not a measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be used in isolation or substituted for the separate predecessor entity and successor entity results.

Included in the year ended December 31, 2009 was revenue of $44.2 million earned from the resale of launch vehicles and related services, a business which we do not currently intend to pursue in the future. By service type, our revenue increased or decreased due to the following:  Transponder services an aggregate increase of $106.0 million, primarily due to a $72.9 million increase in revenue from network services customers, resulting from new business, service expansions and strong renewals, primarily in the Latin America and Caribbean, the Europe and the Africa and Middle East regions, and a $57.2 million increase in revenues from customers of our Intelsat General business, resulting from new business, service expansions and strong renewals primarily in the North America region, a portion of which was related to capacity resold from third parties. These increases were partially offset by a $24.1 million decline in revenue from media customers primarily due to the conclusion of two contracts in 2008, one in the Africa and Middle East region and one in the North America region, as well as a decline in the Latin America and Caribbean regions.  Managed services an aggregate increase of $10.8 million, primarily due to an increase in revenue from network services customers, resulting from new business and service expansions in trunking and private line solutions primarily in the Africa and Middle East region.  Mobile satellite services and other an aggregate increase of $42.4 million, primarily due to increased revenues from professional and technical services performed for satellite operators and other customers of our satellite-related services business, including $26.3 million in increased revenue from the completion of the resale of two launch vehicles during the year ended December 31, 2009, and increased revenue from third-party usage-based mobile services and sales of customer premises equipment primarily for customers of our Intelsat General business.  Channel a decrease of $11.0 million related to continued declines from the migration of point-to-point satellite traffic to fiber optic cables across transoceanic routes and the optimization of customer networks, a trend which we expect will continue. Operating Expenses Direct Costs of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) Direct costs of revenue increased by $38.7 million, or 11%, to $401.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the following:  an increase of $19.1 million primarily for mobile satellite services sold to customers of our Intelsat General business;  an increase of $8.6 million related to launch vehicle resale costs incurred by our satellite related services business;  an increase of $3.9 million in staff expenses primarily related to the adoption of the 2008 Share Plan and equity grants to employees during 2009; and  an increase of $3.2 million related to earth station operations. 54 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $58.5 million, or 29%, to $259.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $54.8 million in costs related to the adoption of the 2008 Share Plan and equity grants to employees during 2009. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $55.8 million, or 6%, to $804.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the combined year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily due to:  a net decrease of $60.4 million in depreciation expense due to certain satellites, ground and other assets becoming fully depreciated, the impairment of Galaxy 26 in 2008 and changes in estimated remaining useful lives of certain satellites; and  a decrease of $18.3 million in amortization expense primarily due to changes in the expected pattern of consumption of amortizable intangible assets; partially offset by  an increase of $26.5 million in depreciation expense resulting from the impact of satellites placed into service during the second half of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009; and  an increase of $2.5 million in depreciation expense attributable to the write-up of our depreciable assets to fair value upon the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition. Income from Operations Our income from operations increased by $477.2 million to $545.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $68.3 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The year-over-year comparisons of our financial results were affected by certain material pre-tax charges as discussed below:  a $499.1 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2009 related to the impairment of our rights to operate at orbital locations resulting from an increase in the discount rate used in our valuation process, compared to a total $390.4 million non-cash impairment charge in 2008 related to the impairment of our orbital locations as a result of the annual impairment analysis of non-amortizable intangible assets, and the impairment of Galaxy 26;  a $164.0 million increase in income from operations as a result of a decrease in the losses recognized on our derivative financial instruments for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The value of undesignated interest rate swaps decreased due to cash settlements for interest, representing the difference between the amount of floating rate interest we receive and the amount of fixed rate interest we pay, offset by an increase in fair value as a result of marking-to-market as well as the decrease in the outstanding liability related to our put option embedded derivative; and  $315.0 million in transaction costs incurred during the combined year ended December 31, 2008 upon consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, with no similar costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. 55 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net consists of the gross interest expense we incur less the amount of interest we capitalize related to capital assets under construction and less interest income earned. We also held interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.3 billion to economically hedge the variability in cash flow on a portion of the floating-rate term loans under our senior secured and unsecured credit facilities. The swaps have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Interest expense, net decreased by $12.9 million, or 1%, to $1.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to $1.38 billion for the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to the following:  a decrease of $96.3 million due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt in 2009 as compared to 2008; and  an increase of $13.1 million in capitalized interest expense; partially offset by  an increase of approximately $68.5 million due to a higher principal amount outstanding of Intelsat Luxembourgs 11½%/12½% Senior PIK Election Notes due 2017 (the 2017 PIK Notes), partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from the purchase of a portion of the 2017 PIK Notes with proceeds from the 2009 Jackson Notes Offering (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLong-Term Debt Changes in 2009);  an increase of approximately $15.3 million due to the incurrence or assumption of approximately $3.7 billion of net additional indebtedness and the refinancing of portions of our debt at higher interest rates in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition;  an increase of $5.4 million due to a higher principal amount of debt and higher interest rates resulting from the repurchase or repayment of certain notes or loans in connection with our change of control offers that were completed in the second and third quarters of 2008; and  an increase of $4.8 million related to the additional indebtedness incurred in connection with the offering of the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLong-Term Debt Changes in 2009). The non-cash portion of total interest expense, net was $423.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and included $298 million of payment-in-kind (PIK) interest expense. Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt Gain on early extinguishment of debt was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $0.6 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The increase of $4.1 million was primarily related to a $19.7 million gain on early extinguishment of debt due to the paydown of $400.0 million face amount of the 2017 PIK Notes in October 2009. This was partially offset by a $15.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in connection with Intelsat Sub Holdcos purchase of $114.2 million of Intelsat, Ltd.s outstanding 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2012 for $93.3 million and $346.5 million of Intelsat, Ltd.s outstanding 6½% Senior Notes due 2013 for $254.6 million pursuant to the Tender Offer (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLong-Term Debt Changes in 2009). The loss was primarily driven by the difference between the carrying value of the notes purchased and the cash paid for the purchase, as a result of the higher unamortized discount recorded in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, when our pre-acquisition long-term debt was adjusted to fair value as of the effective date of the transaction. 56 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income, net was $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $11.4 million other expense, net for the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The increase of $53.4 million was primarily related to equity method and impairment losses of $17.6 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008, $27.3 million of gain from the sale of our equity ownership in WildBlue Communications, Inc. (WildBlue) in the fourth quarter of 2009, and a net $13.9 million increase in exchange rate gains, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian real , which impacts our service contracts with our Brazilian customers. Offsetting these increases were a $3.8 million decrease in miscellaneous income, driven by income in 2008 resulting from a reduction in the amounts we were required to pay under a customer contract as a result of an amendment, and a $1.8 million decrease related to a realized gain on our available-for-sale investments in 2008 compared to a realized loss in 2009. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes increased by $131.4 million to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to a benefit of $120.0 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in expense was principally due to higher earnings in our historical subsidiaries subject to U.S. and U.K. tax as compared to the prior year period primarily due to one-time transaction costs, losses on derivative financial instruments and impairment charges taken in 2008, which exceeded the amounts in 2009. The tax expense reported in our consolidated statements of operations was mostly attributable to U.S. and U.K. taxes, as well as withholding taxes on revenue earned in many of our foreign markets. Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 As a result of the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, the financial results for 2008 have been separately presented for the Predecessor Entity for the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 and for the Successor Entity for the period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. As a result of the New Sponsors Acquisition, the reported results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008 are not necessarily comparable. The primary differences include higher interest expense resulting from the acquisition financing and higher depreciation and amortization cost principally due to the fair value adjustments to long-lived assets in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. 57 Table of Contents For comparative purposes, we combined the periods from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 in our discussion below, as we believe this combination is useful to provide the reader a year-over-year comparison for purposes of understanding our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This combination of results for the Predecessor Entity and Successor Entity periods facilitates an investors understanding of our results of operations for 2007 compared to the combined year ended December 31, 2008. However, this combination is not a U.S. GAAP measure and should not be used in isolation or substituted for the separate predecessor entity and successor entity results.

New business, strong renewals, expansion of existing contracts and improved contract terms contributed to the overall favorable trends. All regions reported revenue increases, with the Europe, the Africa and Middle East, and the North America regions showing the strongest gains. By service type, our revenue increased or decreased due to the following:  Transponder services an aggregate increase of $140.9 million, due primarily to a $114.0 million increase in revenues from network services customers, which resulted from new capacity services and strong renewals in the Africa and Middle East and the Europe regions, and a $32.5 million increase in revenues from our government business customers resulting from new services and strong renewals in North America, offset partially by a decline in revenues from media customers, primarily in North America.  Managed services an aggregate increase of $38.5 million, due primarily to a $23.1 million increase in revenue from network services customers, resulting from new business and service expansion in trunking and private line solutions and GXS broadband solutions in the Africa and Middle East, the North America and the Europe regions, an $11.7 million increase in revenues from managed video solutions for media customers primarily in the Europe and the Latin America and Caribbean regions, and an increase of $3.7 million in revenues from managed services for our government business customers.  Channel a decrease of $18.8 million related to continued declines from the migration of point-to point satellite traffic to fiber optic cables across transoceanic routes and the optimization of customer networks, a trend which we expect will continue.  Mobile satellite services and other an aggregate increase of $21.2 million primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in satellite-related services sold mainly to customers in North America, a $10.5 million increase in usage based mobile services for our government business customers and a $7.2 million increase in professional services, including provision of customer premises equipment for our government business customers. 60 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Direct Costs of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) Direct costs of revenue increased by $39.6 million, or 12%, to $363.1 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to:  a $27.1 million increase in cost of sales, fiber and third-party satellite capacity costs related to increased revenues;  a $10.5 million increase in cost of sales to support our satellite services program management; and  a $6.1 million increase in office and occupancy expense primarily due to building modification and maintenance programs; partially offset by  a $5.4 million decrease in other expenses primarily due to lower satellite-related insurance costs during the combined year ended December 31, 2008. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $37.0 million, or 16%, to $201.4 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to:  a $17.4 million decrease in bad debt expense due to improvements in the timing and amount of account collections, as well as the collection of certain accounts that had been reserved for;  a $12.3 million decrease in professional fees in the combined year ended December 31, 2008 due to heightened expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 to support our integration activities and other merger and acquisition activities; and  an $11.5 million decrease in staff expenses due to the departure of certain executive level staff and other staff reductions during the combined year ended December 31, 2008. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $75.7 million, or 10%, to $859.8 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to:  an increase of $89.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily attributable to the write-up of our depreciable satellites and amortizable assets to fair value upon the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition; and  an increase of $24.0 million in depreciation expense resulting from the full year impact of satellites placed into service during 2007 and the impact of satellites placed into service in 2008, primarily our Galaxy 17, IS-11, Galaxy 18 and Galaxy 19 satellites; partially offset by  a decrease of $33.6 million in depreciation expense due to certain satellites becoming fully depreciated in 2008. 61 Table of Contents Income from Operations Our income from operations decreased by $747.7 million, or 92%, for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The year-over-year comparisons of our financial results were affected by material pre-tax charges as discussed below:  a $390.4 million non-cash impairment charge in 2008, of which $326.8 million was related to the impairment of our orbital locations as a result of our annual impairment analysis of non-amortizable intangible assets and $63.6 million was related to our Galaxy 26 satellite, which experienced a sudden and unexpected electrical distribution anomaly (see Critical Accounting PoliciesAsset Impairment Assessments);  a $305.8 million increase in restructuring and transaction costs primarily associated with the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions, which in 2008 primarily consisted of $197.2 million related to the sale or cancellation of restricted shares and SCAs, a transaction fee of $60.0 million paid to entities affiliated or associated with the New Sponsors under the 2008 MFA and $55.3 million in seller professional fees; and  a $155.0 million decrease in the value of undesignated interest rate swaps as a result of changes in interest rates. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net consists of the gross interest expense we incur less the amount of interest we capitalize related to capital assets under construction and less interest income earned during the year. Interest expense, net increased by $421.1 million, or 44%, to $1.38 billion for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $954.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in interest expense was principally due to the following:  an increase of $424.6 million due to the incurrence of approximately $3.7 billion of net additional indebtedness in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition; and  an increase of $35.3 million related to the amortization of discounts resulting from the adjustments to fair value of our debt in purchase accounting in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition and the higher principal and interest resulting from the change of control refinancings; partially offset by  a decrease of $44.3 million due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt in 2008 as compared to 2007. The non-cash portion of total interest expense, net was $412.7 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 and included $210.5 million of paid-in-kind interest expense and $75.0 million of additional interest accrued to account for the escalation of the applicable interest rate margins under the effective interest method. The remaining non-cash interest expense was primarily associated with the amortization of the deferred financing fees incurred as a result of new or refinanced debt and the amortization and accretion of discounts and premiums recorded to adjust our debt to fair value in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition. Gain (loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt was a gain of $0.6 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to a loss of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase of $38.7 million was primarily related to the $38.1 million loss 62 Table of Contents due to write-offs of debt issuance costs and premiums paid during the year ended December 31, 2007, in connection with the 2007 Refinancings (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe 2007 Refinancings). Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $11.4 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This $11.3 million increase was primarily related to an increase of $10.2 million in equity method and impairment losses from our investment in the satellite-based broadband services provider, WildBlue, including the recognition of $13.0 million of previously suspended losses, and a $6.6 million increase in exchange rate losses, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian real , which impacts our service contracts with our Brazilian customers. Offsetting these increases are an increase of $3.9 million in miscellaneous income, including income resulting from a reduction in the amounts we are required to pay under a customer contract as a result of a recent amendment, $0.6 million in realized gains on our available-for-sale investments, and a $0.7 million increase in rental income. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes decreased by $135.0 million to a benefit of $120.0 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to a provision of $15.0 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in expense was principally due to lower earnings in our historical subsidiaries subject to U.S. and U.K. tax as compared to the prior year period. As Bermuda does not currently impose an income tax, our statutory tax rate was zero. The difference between tax expense reported in our consolidated statements of operations and tax computed at statutory rates was attributable to the provision for foreign taxes, which were principally U.S. and U.K. taxes, as well as withholding taxes on revenue earned in many of our foreign markets. EBITDA EBITDA consists of earnings before net interest, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in the FSS sector, and we present EBITDA to enhance the understanding of our operating performance. We use EBITDA as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) attributable to Intelsat S.A., determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of our operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. 63 Table of Contents A reconciliation of net loss attributable to Intelsat S.A. to EBITDA for the periods shown is as follows (in thousands): Predecessor Entity Combined Successor Entity Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net loss attributable to Intelsat S.A. $ (191,889 ) $ (1,198,167 ) $ (781,692 ) Add: Interest expense, net 954,607 1,375,733 1,362,823 (Gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt 38,143 (576 ) (4,697 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 14,957 (120,037 ) 11,399 Depreciation and amortization 784,120 859,820 804,037 EBITDA $ 1,599,938 $ 916,773 $ 1,391,870 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Items Our cash flows consisted of the following for the periods shown (in thousands): Predecessor Entity Successor Entity Combined Successor Entity Year Ended December 31, 2007 Period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 Period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 557,021 $ 19,619 $ 876,143 $ 895,762 $ 873,656 Net cash used in investing activities (540,988 ) (24,701 ) (409,897 ) (434,598 ) (947,095 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (173,602 ) (22,304 ) (1,504,431 ) (1,526,735 ) 73,001 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (157,087 ) (27,249 ) (1,044,426 ) (1,071,675 ) 7,360 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $22.1 million to $873.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The decreased cash flows from operating activities primarily resulted from an increase in payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including accrued interest. A decrease in collections from accounts receivable as compared to 2008 and an increase in other long-term liabilities also contributed to the decreased cash flows. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net income excluding non-cash items, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in deferred revenue. 64 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased by $512.5 million to $947.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the combined year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $520.7 million associated with satellites under construction and the purchase of satellites during 2009. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.5 billion for the combined year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by proceeds received from refinancing of debt in 2008 completed in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition. During the year ended 2009, cash provided by financing activities included proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $961.9 million, partially offset by a loan repayment to Intelsat Holdings of $34.0 million and repayments on other long-term debt of $823.3 million. Long-Term Debt We are a highly leveraged company and, in connection with the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions, we became a significantly more highly leveraged company, which has resulted in a significant increase in our interest expense. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, our pre-acquisition long-term debt was adjusted to fair value as of the effective date of the transaction, resulting in a net decrease of $182.5 million to the carrying value of the debt. This net difference between the fair value and par value of the debt is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt using the effective interest method. Senior Secured Credit Facilities Intelsat Sub Holdco Senior Secured Credit Facility Intelsat Sub Holdco entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement) on July 3, 2006. The Sub Holdco Credit Agreement provides for a $344.8 million Tranche B Term Loan facility due in 2013 and a $270.8 million revolving credit facility due in 2012. Up to $200.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans. Intelsat Sub Holdco is required to pay a commitment fee for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility, if any, at a rate per annum of 0.375%. Both the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any swingline loans reduce availability under the revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis. Obligations under the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of Intelsat Sub Holdcos subsidiaries, as well as by Intelsat Luxembourg, Intelsat Jackson and Intermediate Holdco, and secured by a perfected first priority security interest to the extent legally permissible in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and subsidiary guarantors, with certain agreed exceptions. On January 19, 2007, Intelsat Sub Holdco amended its senior secured credit facility to change interest rates on the Term Loan B facilities. Interest rates for the term loan portion of the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement range, at the option of Intelsat Sub Holdco, (i) from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 2.00%, or (ii) Above Bank Rate 65 Table of Contents (ABR) plus 0.75% to the ABR plus 1.00%, depending on certain financial measures. Interest rates for the revolving credit facility portion of the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement range, at the option of Intelsat Sub Holdco, (i) from LIBOR plus 2.00% to LIBOR plus 2.25% or (ii) the ABR plus 1.00% to the ABR plus 1.25%, depending on certain financial measures. The ABR and LIBOR, plus the applicable margins, are determined as specified in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement, as amended. On January 25, 2008, Intelsat Sub Holdco entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement, which became effective upon the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition and amended and modified the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement to, among other things: (a) change the applicable margin (i) on ABR loans under the Tranche B Term Loan, revolving credit loan and swingline loan facilities to a rate of 1.5% per annum and (ii) on LIBOR loans under the Tranche B Term Loan, revolving credit loan and swingline loan facilities to a rate of 2.5% per annum; (b) reduce the size of the revolving facility by $50.0 million and add a $50.0 million incremental revolving credit facility provision; (c) add language requiring the payment of a prepayment premium for prepayments of term loans prior to February 4, 2010; (d) make certain changes permitting the New Sponsors Acquisition; and (e) add a financial maintenance covenant requiring compliance with a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement) of less than or equal to 1.5 to 1.0. The Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio is determined by comparing Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined under the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with this financial maintenance covenant ratio with a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio of 0.02:1.00 as of December 31, 2009. In the event we were to fail to comply with this financial maintenance covenant ratio and were unable to obtain waivers, we would default under the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement, and the lenders under the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement could accelerate our obligations thereunder, which would result in an event of default under our existing notes and the notes and the Intelsat Jackson unsecured credit agreements. No amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2009; however, $22.9 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the facility. The borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was $247.9 million at such date. Intelsat Corp Senior Secured Credit Facility As of December 31, 2009, Intelsat Corp had a revolving credit facility and certain term loans outstanding under the Intelsat Corporation Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), which consisted of a $355.9 million Tranche A-3 Senior Secured Term loan due in 2012, a $1.8 billion Tranche B-2 Senior Secured Term Loan facility due in 2014, and a $175.0 million revolving credit facility due in 2012. Up to $150.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans. Intelsat Corp is required to pay a commitment fee for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility, if any, at a rate per annum of 0.375%. Both the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any swingline loans reduce availability under the revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis. Obligations under the Intelsat Corp Amended and 66 Table of Contents Restated Credit Agreement continue to be guaranteed by certain of Intelsat Corps subsidiaries and are secured by a perfected first priority security interest to the extent legally permissible in substantially all of the borrowers and the guarantors tangible and intangible assets, with certain agreed exceptions. In connection with the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat Corp entered into an amendment to renew and extend the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on July 3, 2006. Also, on January 19, 2007, Intelsat Corp amended the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on the Term Loan facilities. Interest rates for the term loan portion of the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement range from LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 2.00% or the ABR plus 0.75% to the ABR plus 1.00%, depending on certain financial measures. Interest rates for the revolving credit facility portion of the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement range from LIBOR plus 2.125% to LIBOR plus 2.875% or the ABR plus 1.125% to the ABR plus 1.875%, depending on certain financial measures. The ABR and LIBOR, plus the applicable margins, are determined as specified in the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended through January 19, 2007. On January 25, 2008, Intelsat Corp entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which became effective upon the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition and amended and modified the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things: (a) change the applicable margin (i) on ABR loans that are term loans to a rate of 1.5% per annum, (ii) on LIBOR loans that are term loans to a rate of 2.5% per annum, (iii) on ABR loans that are revolving credit loans or swingline loans to a rate of between 1.5% and 1.875%, and (iv) on LIBOR loans that are revolving credit loans or swingline loans to a rate of between 2.5% and 2.875%; (b) reduce the size of the revolving facility by $75.0 million and add a $75.0 million incremental revolving credit facility provision; (c) require the payment of a prepayment premium for prepayments of term loans prior to February 4, 2011 (with respect to Tranche B-2-A Term Loans) or February 14, 2010 (with respect to Tranche B-2-B Term Loans); (d) make certain changes permitting the New Sponsors Acquisition; and (e) add a financial maintenance covenant requiring compliance with a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of less than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0. On February 4, 2008, in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, Intelsat Corp also executed a Joinder Agreement by and among Intelsat Corp, the several lenders party thereto and certain other parties, to the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement pursuant to which it incurred an additional $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B-2 Term Loan. The Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio is determined by comparing Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined under the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with this financial maintenance covenant ratio, with a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio of 2.57:1.00, as of December 31, 2009. In the event we were to fail to comply with this financial maintenance covenant ratio and were unable to obtain waivers, we would default under the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and the lenders under the Intelsat Corp 67 Table of Contents Amended and Restated Credit Agreement could accelerate our obligations thereunder, which would result in an event of default under our existing notes and the notes and the Intelsat Jackson unsecured credit agreements. No amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2009; however, $2.1 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the facility. The borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was $152.2 million at such date. One of the lenders under the revolving credit facility, representing approximately $20.8 million of the $175.0 million of aggregate lending commitments, did not provide any funds in response to a September 2008 borrowing request we made under the revolving credit facility. Our availability of $152.2 million as of December 31, 2009 under the revolving credit facility does not include this $20.8 million commitment, and we can provide no assurance that the commitment will be honored by the relevant lender if we make future borrowing requests. The 2007 Refinancings On January 12, 2007, Intelsat Bermuda issued $600.0 million in Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2015 (the Refinancing Notes). The net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand, were used to repay Intelsat Bermudas then outstanding $600.0 million Senior Unsecured Bridge Loan, and to pay related fees and expenses. On January 19, 2007, Intelsat Sub Holdco amended its credit agreement dated as of July 3, 2006 to reduce the Term Loan B facility interest rate from a range of LIBOR plus 2.00% to LIBOR plus 2.25% to a range of LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 2.00%. Also on January 19, 2007, Intelsat Corporation further amended its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to reduce the Term Loan A-3 interest rate and Term Loan B-2 interest rate from a range of LIBOR plus 2.125% to LIBOR plus 2.875% to a range of LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 2.00%. The interest rate ranges were again amended effective February 4, 2008. In addition, on February 2, 2007, Intelsat Bermuda borrowed a $1.0 billion term loan due 2014 pursuant to the Intelsat Jackson Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, which was assumed by Intelsat Jackson as part of the Intelsat Bermuda Transfer. The proceeds of the borrowing thereunder were contributed to Intermediate Holdco, and Intermediate Holdco contributed the proceeds to Intelsat Sub Holdco, which used the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to redeem its outstanding $1.0 billion Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2012 and pay the related premium, fees and expenses. The issuance of the Refinancing Notes, the amendments to Intelsat Sub Holdcos and Intelsat Corporations credit agreements, the borrowing under the Intelsat Bermuda Unsecured Credit Agreement and the related repayment of Intelsat Bermudas Senior Unsecured Bridge Loan and redemption of Intelsat Sub Holdcos $1.0 billion Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2012 are referred to collectively as the 2007 Refinancings. New Sponsors Acquisition Financing Bridge Loan Credit Agreements On February 4, 2008, in order to partially finance the New Sponsors Acquisition, Serafina borrowed $4.96 billion in aggregate principal amount of term loans under the Bridge Loan Credit Agreements. Immediately following the New Sponsors Acquisition and the Intelsat Bermuda Transfer, Intelsat Bermuda assumed the Bridge Loan Agreements as part of the Serafina Assignment. Borrowings under the Senior Bridge Loan Credit Agreement bore interest at LIBOR, plus a margin of 4.5%. Borrowings under the PIK Election Bridge Loan Credit Agreement bore interest at LIBOR, plus a margin of 4.75%. In addition, we had the option to pay interest under the PIK Election Bridge Loan Credit Agreement in PIK interest at a PIK interest rate equal to the cash pay 68 Table of Contents interest rate in effect during the interest period plus 100 basis points. We elected to pay interest under the PIK Election Bridge Loan Credit Agreement entirely in PIK interest for all interest periods through June 26, 2008. On June 27, 2008, Intelsat Bermuda repaid in full the Bridge Loan Credit Agreements and issued new senior notes as described in 2008 Debt Refinancings below. Credit Facility Amendments In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corp entered into amendments to their existing credit agreements. See Senior Secured Credit Facilities above. Debt Transfer, Repayment and Redemptions On January 15, 2008, we repaid at maturity Intelsat Corps $150.0 million 6 3 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2008 using funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility portion of Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities. On February 4, 2008, Intelsat Corp used the proceeds of its incremental Tranche B-2 Term Loan and cash on hand to repay this $150.0 million revolver borrowing. Intelsat Bermuda assigned its debt obligations to Intelsat Jackson on February 4, 2008 (see Impact of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions) and we subsequently redeemed $1.26 billion in long-term debt and incurred early redemption premiums of $38.5 million as follows:  on February 7, 2008, Intelsat Jacksons $260.0 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 were redeemed and an early redemption premium of $18.9 million was incurred;  on February 7, 2008, Intelsat Jacksons $600.0 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2015 were redeemed and an early redemption premium of $12.0 million was incurred; and  on March 6, 2008, Intelsat, Ltd.s $400.0 million of 5¼% Senior Notes due 2008 were redeemed and an early redemption premium of $7.6 million was incurred. The premiums incurred were included in the fair value of the associated debt as of the date of the New Sponsors Acquisition. Change of Control Offers The New Sponsors Acquisition resulted in a change of control under the indentures governing certain of our outstanding series of notes and the Intelsat Jackson Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, giving the holders of those notes and loans the right to require us to repurchase such notes and repay such loans at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase or repayment. During the second and third quarters of 2008, the relevant entities completed each such change of control offer, financing the repurchases and repayment through backstop unsecured credit agreement borrowings under the Financing Commitment Letter or with proceeds from offerings of notes and a new unsecured term loan borrowing. The following principal amounts were tendered and repurchased or repaid in the change of control offers:  $281.8 million of Intelsat Jacksons 11¼% Senior Notes due 2016;  $695.0 million of Intelsat Jacksons 9¼% Senior Notes due 2016; 69 Table of Contents  $804.8 million of loans outstanding under the Intelsat Jackson Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement;  $408.1 million of Intermediate Holdcos $478.7 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 9¼% Senior Discount Notes due 2015;  $874.6 million of Intelsat Sub Holdcos 8¼% Senior Notes due 2013;  $674.3 million of Intelsat Sub Holdcos 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2015;  $651.6 million of Intelsat Corps 9% Senior Notes due 2014; and  $575.0 million of Intelsat Corps 9% Senior Notes due 2016. 2008 Debt Refinancings On June 27, 2008, Intelsat Bermuda issued $2.81 billion of 11¼% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Senior Notes), and $2.23 billion of the 2017 PIK Notes. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Senior Notes and the 2017 PIK Notes were used to repay in full the $4.96 billion of borrowings under the Bridge Loan Credit Agreements. Interest on both the 2017 Senior Notes and the 2017 PIK Notes is payable semi-annually on August 15 and February 15, commencing on August 15, 2008. The 2017 Senior Notes bore interest at 7.28% on and prior to August 4, 2008, and bear interest at 11¼% after August 4, 2008. Intelsat Luxembourg may, at its option, elect to pay interest for any applicable interest period on the 2017 PIK Notes (i) entirely in cash, (ii) entirely in PIK interest or (iii) 50% in cash and 50% in PIK interest, through February 15, 2013. After February 15, 2013, interest on the 2017 PIK Notes is payable in cash. Cash interest on the 2017 PIK Notes accrued at the rate of 7.53% on and prior to August 4, 2008, and accrues at 11½% after August 4, 2008. If we elect to pay interest in the form of PIK interest, the applicable PIK interest rate will be the cash pay interest rate in effect during the period plus 100 basis points. If we elect to pay interest in the form of PIK interest, we will either increase the principal amount of the outstanding 2017 PIK Notes or issue new 2017 PIK Notes to holders of the 2017 PIK Notes in an amount equal to the amount of PIK interest for the applicable interest payment period. We made elections to pay interest on the 2017 PIK Notes entirely in PIK interest for all interest periods through August 15, 2010. On June 27, 2008, Intelsat Sub Holdco repaid $883.3 million of borrowings under a backstop senior unsecured credit agreement due 2013 and $681.0 million of borrowings under a backstop senior unsecured credit agreement due 2015 with the proceeds of an offering of $883.3 million of Senior Notes due 2013, bearing interest at 8½% (guaranteed by certain subsidiaries), and $681.0 million of Senior Notes due 2015, bearing interest at 8 7 / 8 % (guaranteed by certain subsidiaries) (collectively, the New Sub Holdco Senior Notes). The initial purchasers of the New Sub Holdco Senior Notes and the lenders under the backstop senior unsecured credit agreements were affiliated parties and the repayment was completed without an exchange of cash between us and the lenders. On June 27, 2008, Intermediate Holdco repaid borrowings under a backstop senior unsecured credit agreement due 2015 with the proceeds of an offering of 9½% Senior Discount Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Senior Discount Notes). The initial purchasers of the 2015 Senior Discount Notes and the lenders under the backstop senior unsecured credit agreement were affiliated parties and the repayment was completed without an exchange of cash between us and the lenders. On July 1, 2008, Intelsat Jackson issued $284.6 million of Senior Notes due 2016, bearing interest at 11½%, and $701.9 million of Senior Notes due 2016 (guaranteed by certain subsidiaries), bearing interest at 9½% (collectively, the New Jackson Senior Notes). The 70 Table of Contents proceeds of the New Jackson Senior Notes were used, together with cash on hand, to fund the repurchase of Intelsat Jacksons 11¼% Senior Notes due 2016 and Intelsat Jacksons 9¼% Senior Notes due 2016 tendered in change of control offers. The New Jackson Senior Notes have substantially similar terms to the notes repurchased. Intelsat Jackson also repaid loans tendered in a change of control offer relating to the Intelsat Jackson Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement with borrowings of $810.9 million under a new senior unsecured credit agreement that was entered into on July 1, 2008 (the New Intelsat Jackson Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement), together with cash on hand. Borrowings under the New Intelsat Jackson Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus 300 basis points or (ii) the ABR, which is the rate for any day equal to the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points or (b) the prime rate, plus 200 basis points. On July 18, 2008, Intelsat Corp repaid $658.1 million of borrowings under a backstop senior unsecured credit agreement due 2014 and $580.7 million of borrowings under a backstop senior unsecured credit agreement due 2016 with the proceeds of an offering of $658.1 million of Senior Notes due 2014, bearing interest at 9¼%, and $580.7 million of Senior Notes due 2016, bearing interest at 9¼% (collectively, the New Intelsat Corp Senior Notes). The initial purchasers of the New Intelsat Corp Senior Notes and the lenders under the backstop senior unsecured credit agreements were affiliated parties and the repayment was completed without an exchange of cash between us and the lenders. Long-Term Debt Changes in 2009 On October 20, 2009, our indirect subsidiary, Intelsat Jackson, completed an offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 8½% Senior Notes due 2019, which yielded $487.1 million of cash proceeds at issuance (the 2009 Jackson Notes Offering). Upon consummation of the 2009 Jackson Notes Offering, Intelsat Jackson paid a dividend to Intelsat Bermuda in an amount equal to the purchase price paid by Intelsat Bermuda to purchase $400.0 million face amount of the 2017 PIK Notes from Banc of America Securities LLC at a discount. Intelsat Bermuda then canceled the purchased 2017 PIK Notes. After giving effect to the purchase of the 2017 PIK Notes and fees and expenses related thereto and the 2009 Jackson Notes Offering, $101.1 million of the proceeds from the 2009 Jackson Notes Offering remained available for general corporate purposes. On July 31, 2009, our indirect subsidiary, Intelsat Sub Holdco, redeemed the approximately $0.4 million principal amount of its outstanding 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2015 and the approximately $0.4 million principal amount of its outstanding 8¼% Senior Notes due 2013. On July 31, 2009, our indirect subsidiary, Intelsat Corp, redeemed the approximately $1.0 million principal amount of its outstanding 9% Senior Notes due 2014 and the approximately $0.01 million principal amount of its outstanding 9% Senior Notes due 2016. On February 12, 2009, our indirect subsidiary, Intelsat Sub Holdco, purchased $114.2 million of Intelsat, Ltd.s outstanding 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2012 for $93.3 million and $346.5 million of Intelsat, Ltd.s outstanding 6½% Senior Notes due 2013 for $254.6 million pursuant to a cash tender offer (the Tender Offer). Intelsat Sub Holdco funded the Tender Offer through an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 8 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2015, Series B (the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes), completed on February 12, 2009, which yielded $348.3 million of proceeds at issuance, together with cash on hand. The new notes have terms substantially similar to Intelsat Sub Holdcos outstanding 8 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2015 issued in June 2008. 71 Table of Contents New Dawn Credit Facilities On December 5, 2008, New Dawn entered into a $215.0 million secured financing arrangement that consists of senior and mezzanine term loan facilities. The credit facilities are non-recourse to New Dawns shareholders, including Intelsat S.A. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, beyond the shareholders scheduled capital contributions. The senior facility provides for a commitment of up to $125.0 million. The interest rate on term loans under the senior facility is the aggregate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 3.0% and 4.0% and certain costs, if incurred. The mezzanine facility provides for a commitment of up to $90.0 million. The interest rate on term loans under the mezzanine facility is the aggregate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 5.3% and 6.3% and certain costs, if incurred. New Dawn is required to pay a commitment fee at a rate per annum of 0.5% on any unused commitments under the credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2009, New Dawn incurred satellite related capital expenditures of $97.9 million, and as of December 31, 2009 it had aggregate outstanding borrowings of $114.8 million under the credit facilities. Satellite Performance Incentives Our cost of satellite construction includes an element of deferred consideration to satellite manufacturers referred to as satellite performance incentives. We are contractually obligated to make these payments over the lives of the satellites, provided the satellites continue to operate in accordance with contractual specifications. We capitalize the present value of these payments as part of the cost of the satellites and record a corresponding liability to the satellite manufacturers. This asset is amortized over the useful lives of the satellites and the liability is accreted as interest expense based on the passage of time and reduced as the payments are made. Our total satellite performance incentive payment liability as of December 31, 2008 and 2009 was $155.2 million and $147.5 million, respectively. Intelsat S.A. Notes Consent On April 22, 2010, Intelsat S.A. completed a consent solicitation that amended certain terms of the indenture governing its 2013 Senior Notes and 2012 Senior Notes. As consideration for the consents obtained, Intelsat S.A. paid the consenting holders of such notes a consent payment equal to 2% of the outstanding principal amount of notes held by such holders that totaled approximately $15.4 million. See Description of Other IndebtednessIntelsat, Ltd. Senior Notes due 2013 and Intelsat, Ltd. Senior Notes due 2012 for more information on this consent solicitation. Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA and Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA In addition to EBITDA, which is calculated as set forth in Results of Operations, we calculate a measure called Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA, based on the term Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement. Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA as adjusted to exclude or include certain unusual items, certain other operating expense items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement as described in the table and related footnotes below. Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA, as presented below, is calculated only with respect to Intelsat Sub Holdco and its subsidiaries. Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of certain ratios used in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement, such as the secured debt leverage ratio and the total leverage ratio. Under the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement, Intelsat Sub Holdco must maintain a pro forma secured net debt leverage ratio not greater than 1.50 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter, and generally may not incur additional indebtedness (subject to certain exceptions) if the total 72 Table of Contents leverage ratio calculated on a pro forma basis at the time of incurrence would exceed 4.75 to 1.00. In addition, under the investments and dividends covenants contained in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement, the ability of Intelsat Sub Holdco to make investments and pay dividends is restricted by formulas based on the amount of Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA measured from April 1, 2006. In addition to EBITDA and Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA, we also calculate a measure called Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA (previously referred to as New Bermuda Adjusted EBITDA), based on the term Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the indenture governing the 2017 Senior Notes and the 2017 PIK Notes (collectively, the 2008 Luxembourg Notes). Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA as adjusted to exclude or include certain unusual items, certain other operating expense items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture of Intelsat Luxembourg as described in the table and related footnotes below. Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA as presented below is calculated only with respect to Intelsat Luxembourg and its subsidiaries. Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of certain ratios used in the indenture governing the 2008 Luxembourg Notes, such as the debt to Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA ratio and the secured indebtedness leverage ratio. Under Intelsat Luxembourgs indenture, Intelsat Luxembourg generally may not incur additional indebtedness (subject to certain exceptions) if the debt to Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA ratio calculated on a pro forma basis at the time of such incurrence would exceed 8.00 to 1.00 and Intelsat Luxembourg cannot incur certain liens to secure indebtedness (subject to certain exceptions) if the secured indebtedness leverage ratio, after giving effect to the incurrence, exceeds 2.50 to 1.00. In addition, under this indenture, satisfaction of a 6.75 to 1.00 debt to Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA ratio is generally (subject to certain exceptions) a condition to the making of restricted payments by Intelsat Luxembourg. Furthermore, under the restricted payments covenants contained in this indenture (subject to certain exceptions), the ability of Intelsat Luxembourg to make restricted payments (including the making of investments and the payment of dividends) is restricted by a formula based on the amount of Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA measured from January 1, 2008 and calculated without making pro forma adjustments. We believe that the inclusion of Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA and Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about the calculation of certain covenants in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 2008 Luxembourg Notes as mentioned above. We believe that some investors may use Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA and Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our liquidity and financial condition. Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA and Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA and Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA and Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) attributable to Intelsat S.A., determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as indicators of cash flows, or as measures of liquidity. 73 Table of Contents A reconciliation of net cash provided by Intelsat S.A. operating activities to net loss attributable to Intelsat S.A.; net loss attributable to Intelsat S.A. to Intelsat S.A.

For comparative purposes, we combined the periods from January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 and February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, as we believe this combination is useful to provide the reader a more accurate comparison. This combination is not a U.S. GAAP measure and it is provided to enhance the readers understanding of the results of operations for the periods presented.

(12) Represents satellite performance incentive interest expense required to be excluded from interest expense for the calculation of Intelsat Luxembourg Adjusted EBITDA, but permitted to be included as part of interest expense for the calculation of Sub Holdco Adjusted EBITDA. (13) This measure is reported publicly by our subsidiary, Intelsat Corp, which is not a subsidiary of Intelsat Sub Holdco. (14) Reflects expenses of Intelsat Luxembourg and other holding companies not consolidated under Intelsat Sub Holdco. Funding Sources and Uses We are a highly leveraged company and have incurred significant additional debt over the last three years, which has resulted in a large increase in our obligations related to debt service, 75 Table of Contents including increased interest expense. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.4 billion, which included $423.4 million of non-cash interest expense. We currently expect to use cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our senior secured credit facilities to fund our most significant cash outlays, including debt service requirements and capital expenditures, in the next twelve months. We continually evaluate ways to simplify our capital structure and opportunistically extend our maturities and reduce our costs of debt. No amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2009; however, we had aggregate outstanding letters of credit of $22.9 million under the revolver portion of Intelsat Sub Holdcos senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 million under the revolver portion of Intelsat Corps senior secured credit facilities. Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corp had $247.9 million (net of standby letters of credit) and $152.2 million (net of standby letters of credit), respectively, of availability remaining under their senior secured credit facilities at that date. The ability of Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corp to borrow under their respective revolving credit facility is subject to compliance by each companys indirect parent, Intelsat S.A., with a senior secured debt covenant included in the indenture governing Intelsat S.A.s senior notes (as in effect at the time the Intelsat Sub Holdco credit agreement was executed (July 3, 2006)). As a result, under certain circumstances, Intelsat Sub Holdco may not be able to borrow up to the full amount of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility if Intelsat Corp has certain amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility, and Intelsat Corp may not be able to borrow up to the full amount of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility if Intelsat Sub Holdco has certain amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures depend on our business strategies and reflect our commercial responses to opportunities and trends in our industry. Our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures if, among other things, we enter into any currently unplanned strategic transactions. Levels of capital spending from one year to the next are also influenced by the nature of the satellite life cycle and by the capital-intensive nature of the satellite industry. For example, we incur significant capital expenditures during the years in which satellites are under construction. We typically procure a new satellite within a timeframe that would allow the satellite to be deployed at least one year prior to the end of the service life of the satellite to be replaced. As a result, we frequently experience significant variances in our capital expenditures from year to year. The following table compares our satellite-related capital expenditures to total capital expenditures from 2005 through 2009 (the table below does not reflect expenditures of PanAmSat prior to its acquisition in 2006) (in thousands). Year Satellite-Related Capital Expenditures Total Capital Expenditures 2005 $ 99,901 $ 133,507 2006 101,335 152,086 2007 474,060 543,612 2008 370,761 422,460 2009 887,595 943,133 Total 1,933,652 2,194,798 Payment for satellites and other property and equipment also excludes funds paid for deposits on future satellites and launches that are included as a part of other assets and capitalized as construction progresses. 76 Table of Contents We have eight satellites in development, including Intelsat New Dawn, that are expected to be launched from 2010 to 2012. In addition to these announced programs, we expect to procure two additional replacement satellites during this period. By the conclusion of 2012, we do not expect our total station-kept transponder count to change significantly from current levels. We expect our 2010 total capital expenditures to range from $825 million to $900 million, including some capital expenditures that were expected to be incurred in 2009 but that now are expected to be incurred in 2010. Expected annual capital expenditure ranges for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 are $800 million to $875 million, and $450 million to $525 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures guidance excludes capital expenditures associated with the Intelsat New Dawn satellite being procured and launched by our New Dawn joint venture. Currency and Exchange Rates Substantially all of our customer contracts, capital expenditure contracts and operating expense obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, we are not exposed to material foreign currency exchange risk. However, the service contracts with our Brazilian customers provide for payment in Brazilian reais . Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of a reduction in the value of the Brazilian reais as compared to the U.S. dollar in connection with payments made by Brazilian customers, and our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate for Brazilian reais is ongoing. However, the rates payable under our service contracts with Brazilian customers are adjusted annually to account for inflation in Brazil, thereby mitigating the risk. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 and the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, our Brazilian customers represented approximately 2%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 2%, respectively, of our revenues. Transactions in other currencies are converted into U.S. dollars using rates in effect on the dates of the transactions. We recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of $7.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, $6.1 million during the combined year ended December 31, 2008 and a gain of $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The gain or loss in each year was primarily attributable to the conversion of our Brazilian reais cash balances held in Brazil and other working capital account balances to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the applicable year or, with respect to exchange transactions effected during the year, at the time the exchange transactions occurred. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements On August 1, 2005, Intelsat Corp formed a second satellite joint investment with JSAT to build and launch a Ku-band satellite, Horizons-2. The Horizons-2 satellite was launched in December 2007 and placed into service in February 2008. Our investment is being accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The total future joint investment in Horizons-2 is expected to be $130.4 million as of December 31, 2009, of which each of the joint venture partners is required to fund their 50% share. Our share of the results of Horizons-2 is included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and was income of $0.3 million for the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the investment balance of $79.2 million and $75.3 million, respectively, was included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, there was no adjustment to the investment balance or the corresponding liability balance. In connection with our investment in Horizons-2, we entered into a capital contribution and subscription agreement in August 2005, which requires us to fund our 50% share of the amounts due under Horizons-2s loan agreement with a third-party lender. Pursuant to this 77 Table of Contents agreement, we had made contributions of $9.7 million and $12.2 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. We have entered into a security and pledge agreement with a third-party lender and, pursuant to this agreement, granted a security interest in our contribution obligation to the lender. Therefore, we have recorded this obligation as an indirect guarantee. We recorded a liability of $12.2 million within accrued liabilities as of each of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and a liability of $61.0 million and $48.8 million within other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We do not have any other significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and capital and certain other commitments as of December 31, 2009 and the expected year of payment (in thousands): Payments due by year Contractual Obligations(1) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 and thereafter Other Total Long-Term debt obligations Intelsat S.A. and subsidiary notes and credit facilities (excluding Intelsat Corp)principal payment(2) $ 8,448 $ 3,448 $ 495,967 $ 1,574,848 $ 1,024,491 $ 9,471,549 $  $ 12,578,751 Intelsat S.A. and subsidiary notes and credit facilities (excluding Intelsat Corp)interest payment(3) 880,963 1,182,034 1,164,124 1,105,284 1,009,099 2,118,487  7,459,991 Intelsat Corp notes and credit facilitiesprincipal payment 89,051 91,275 77,929 17,869 2,320,034 705,719  3,301,877 Intelsat Corp notes and credit facilitiesinterest payment(3) 176,038 173,564 170,743 169,207 134,615 196,590  1,020,757 Capital lease obligations (including interest) 196       196 Operating lease obligations 2,705 1,699 (150 ) (7) (1,084 ) (7) (989 ) (7) 44,814  46,995 Purchase obligations(4) 781,905 406,738 74,819 27,934 14,494 140,176  1,446,066 Other long-term liabilities (including interest)(5) 43,717 36,870 36,458 35,296 33,639 89,695  275,675 Income tax contingencies(6)       86,921 86,921 Total contractual obligations $ 1,983,023 $ 1,895,628 $ 2,019,890 $ 2,929,354 $ 4,535,383 $ 12,767,030 $ 86,921 $ 26,217,229 (1) Obligations related to Intelsats pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations are excluded from the table. See Note 6Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. (2) Principal payments for Intelsat S.A. and subsidiaries include PIK interest capitalized as part of the 2017 PIK Notes principal in February 2010. 78 Table of Contents (3) Represents estimated interest payments to be made on our fixed and variable rate debt and fees owed in connection with our senior secured credit facilities and letters of credit. All interest payments assume that principal payments are made as originally scheduled. Interest payments for variable rate debt and incentive obligations have been estimated based on the current interest rates. (4) Includes satellite construction and launch contracts, estimated payments to be made on performance incentive obligations related to certain satellites that are currently under construction, vendor contracts and customer commitments. (5) Includes satellite performance incentive obligations (and interest thereon) and our Horizons contribution obligation. Also, excludes future commitments related to our interest rate swaps. (6) The timing of future cash flows from income tax contingencies cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore are reflected in the Other column. See Note 13Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this prospectus for further discussion of income tax contingencies. (7) In 2013 and 2014, our rental income on our owned Washington, D.C. building and our sublease income on leased facilities will exceed our operating lease commitments. Satellite Construction and Launch Obligations As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1.3 billion of expenditures remaining under our existing satellite construction contracts and satellite launch contracts. Satellite launch and in-orbit insurance contracts related to future satellites to be launched are cancelable up to thirty days prior to the satellites launch. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any non-cancelable commitments related to existing launch insurance or in-orbit insurance contracts for satellites to be launched. See BusinessOur NetworkSatellite SystemsPlanned Satellites for details relating to certain of our satellite construction and launch contracts. Horizons Contributions Obligation See Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements for additional information regarding our contribution obligation for Horizons-2. Operating Leases We have commitments for operating leases primarily relating to equipment and office facilities. These leases contain escalation provisions for increases. As of December 31, 2009, minimum annual rentals of all leases (net of sublease income on leased facilities and rental income on our owned Washington, D.C. building totaling $16.8 million), totaled approximately $47.0 million, exclusive of potential increases in real estate taxes, operating assessments and future sublease income. Customer and Vendor Contracts We have contracts with certain of our customers which require us to provide equipment, services and other support during the term of the related contracts. We also have long-term contractual obligations with service providers primarily for the operation of certain of our satellites. As of December 31, 2009, we had commitments under these customer and vendor contracts which totaled approximately $183.8 million related to the provision of equipment, services and other support. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates and foreign currencies. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. In addition, 79 Table of Contents with respect to our interest rate swaps as described below, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which we seek to minimize through credit support agreements and the review and monitoring of all counterparties. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk The satellite communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risks include: the risk of increasing interest rates on short-term debt; the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long-term financings; and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned refinancings using long-term fixed rate debt. Approximately 78%, or $12.2 billion, of our debt as of December 31, 2009 was fixed-rate debt, excluding interest rate swaps. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings or cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. As of December 31, 2009, we held interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.3 billion with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2014. These swaps were entered into to economically hedge the variability in cash flow on a portion of the floating rate term loans under our senior secured and unsecured credit facilities. On a quarterly basis, we receive a floating rate of interest equal to the three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of interest. On December 31, 2009, the rate we would pay averaged 3.9% and the rate we would receive averaged 0.3%. In addition, certain of these swaps contain options covering a notional amount of $717.0 million that would effectively permit us to terminate the underlying swaps on March 14, 2011, prior to the stated maturity of March 14, 2013. If we exercise the options, the cash flows (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) for the underlying swap and those from the options are expected to offset one another. These interest rate swaps and options have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (FASB ASC 815), as amended and interpreted, and the changes in fair value of these instruments will be recognized in earnings during the period of change. Assuming a one percentage point decrease in the prevailing forward yield curve, the fair value of the interest rate swap liability would decrease to a liability of approximately $188.6 million from $113.9 million and the fair value of the options would increase to an asset of approximately $26.3 million from $15.5 million. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt, including interest rate swaps, and cash and cash equivalents. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows as of December 31, 2009. While our variable-rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change, it is not subject to changes in fair values. Foreign Currency Risk We do not currently use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposures. Substantially all of our customer contracts, capital expenditure contracts and operating expense obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, we are not 80 Table of Contents exposed to material foreign currency exchange risk. However, the service contracts with our Brazilian customers provide for payment in Brazilian reais . Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of a reduction in the value of the Brazilian reais as compared to the U.S. dollar in connection with payments made by Brazilian customers, and our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate for Brazilian reais is ongoing. However, the rates payable under our service contracts with Brazilian customers are adjusted annually to account for inflation in Brazil, thereby mitigating the risk. For the predecessor year ended December 31, 2007, the combined year ended December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, our Brazilian customers represented approximately 2%, 2.4% and 2% of our revenue, respectively. Transactions in other currencies are converted into U.S. dollars using rates in effect on the dates of the transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection of accounting policies and the application of accounting estimates, some of which require management to make significant assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that some of the more important estimates and related assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations are in the areas of revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, satellites and other property and equipment, business combinations, income taxes, asset impairments and fair value measurements. There were no accounting policies adopted during 2008 or 2009 that had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Revenue Recognition, Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Revenue Recognition. We earn revenue primarily from satellite utilization charges and, to a lesser extent, from providing managed services to our customers. In general, we recognize revenue from satellite utilization in the period during which the services are provided. While the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions, there are certain transactions that contain non-standard business terms and conditions. Additionally, we may enter into certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements (arrangements with more than one deliverable). As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions, including:  whether an arrangement contains a lease or is otherwise subject to lease accounting literature;  whether an arrangement should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent;  whether we can develop reasonably dependable estimates about the extent of progress towards contract completion, contract revenues and costs;  whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit when cash is paid to a vendor and whether we can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of such benefit;  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements; and  when to recognize revenue related to the deliverables. We receive payments from some customers in advance of our providing services. Amounts received from customers pursuant to satellite capacity prepayment options are recorded in the consolidated financial statements as deferred revenue. These deferred amounts are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the agreement terms. In addition, our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured, which requires us, among other things, to evaluate the creditworthiness 81 Table of Contents of our customers. Changes in judgments in these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing and/or amount of revenue recognition. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an evaluation of the aging of our accounts receivable, and considers such factors as the likelihood of collection based upon an evaluation of the customers creditworthiness, the customers payment history and other conditions or circumstances that may affect the likelihood of payment, such as political and economic conditions in the country in which the customer is located. When we have determined that the collection of payments for satellite utilization or managed services is not reasonably assured at the time the service is provided, we defer recognition of the revenue until such time as collection is believed to be reasonably assured or the payment is received. If our estimate of the likelihood of collection is not accurate, we may experience lower revenue or an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts. Satellites and Other Property and Equipment Satellites and other property and equipment acquired as part of the New Sponsors Acquisition were based on their fair value as of the date of acquisition, excluding satellites under construction at the time of the acquisition, which were reflected at historical cost (which we believed approximated fair value). Satellites and other property and equipment purchased following the New Sponsors Acquisition are stated at cost. Historical cost consists primarily of the cost of satellite construction and launch, including premiums for launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentives expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers, costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. Satellite construction and launch services are generally procured under long-term contracts that provide for payments by us over the contract periods. Satellite construction and launch services costs are capitalized to reflect progress toward completion, which typically coincides with contract milestone payment schedules. Insurance premiums related to satellite launches and subsequent in-orbit testing are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related satellites. Performance incentives payable in future periods are dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites in service. Satellites and other property and equipment are depreciated and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The remaining depreciable lives of our satellites range from less than one year to 16 years as of December 31, 2009. We make estimates of the useful lives of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellites performance, including its orbital design life and its estimated service life. The orbital design life of a satellite is the length of time that the manufacturer has contractually committed that the satellites hardware will remain operational under normal operating conditions. In contrast, a satellites service life is the length of time the satellite is expected to remain operational as determined by remaining fuel levels and consumption rates. Our in-orbit satellites generally have orbital design lives ranging from ten to 15 years and service lives as high as 20 years. The useful depreciable lives of our satellites generally exceed the orbital design lives and are less than the service lives. Although the service lives of our satellites have historically extended beyond their depreciable lives, this trend may not continue. We periodically review the remaining estimated useful lives of our satellites to determine if any revisions to our estimates are necessary based on the health of the individual satellites. Changes in our estimate of the useful lives of our satellites could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. We charge to operations the carrying value of any satellite lost as a result of a launch or in-orbit failure upon the occurrence of the loss. In the event of a partial failure, we record an impairment charge to operations upon the occurrence of the loss if the undiscounted future 82 Table of Contents cash flows are less than the carrying value of the satellite. We measure the impairment charge as the excess of the carrying value of the satellite over its estimated fair value as determined by the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We reduce the charge to operations resulting from either a complete or a partial failure by the amount of any insurance proceeds that were either due and payable to or received by us, and by the amount of any deferred satellite performance incentives that are no longer applicable following the failure. See Asset Impairment Assessments below for further discussion. Business Combinations Our business combinations are accounted for in accordance with the guidance provided under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (FASB ASC 805), whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date. The portion of the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves estimates and judgments by our management that may be adjusted during the allocation period, but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date, except for pre-acquisition tax contingencies that may be adjusted beyond the allocation period in accordance with FASB ASC 805. These allocations are made based on managements best estimates and assumptions. In arriving at the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we consider the following generally accepted valuation approaches: the cost approach, income approach, and market approach. Our estimates may also include assumptions about projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, tax amortization periods, technology royalty rates and technology life cycles, the regulatory and legal environment, and industry and economic trends. Asset Impairment Assessments Goodwill. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the guidance provided under FASB ASC 350. Under this topic, goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination, and determined to have an indefinite useful life, are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more often if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred. We are required to identify reporting units at a level below the companys identified operating segments for impairment analysis. We have identified only one reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. Additionally, our identifiable intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption for each respective asset. Assumptions and Approach Used. We follow a two-step process to evaluate if a potential impairment exists to our recorded amounts of goodwill. The first step of the process is to compare the reporting units fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. In the event the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and the second step is required. The second step requires us to calculate a hypothetical purchase allocation to compare the current implied fair value of the goodwill to the current carrying value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if they were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill as described above exceeds recorded goodwill, there is no impairment. If the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess. Furthermore, an impairment loss cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. After 83 Table of Contents recognizing the impairment loss, the corresponding loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting standards. We determined the estimated fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis, along with independent source data related to comparative market multiples and, when available, recent transactions. The discounted cash flows were derived from our five-year projection of revenues and expenses plus a residual value, with the resulting projected cash flows discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. The analysis, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009, did not result in an impairment of our goodwill. The key assumptions in our discounted cash flow analysis related to revenue growth rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. Our impairment analysis could be impacted by uncontrollable or unforeseeable events that could positively or negatively affect the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. A change in the estimated future cash flows could change our estimated fair values and result in future impairments. Our analysis included projected growth rates for revenue consistent with general expectations in the FSS sector and our historical experience. The FSS sector is characterized by relatively stable and predictable contracted revenue streams, high operating margins, strong cash flows and long-term contractual commitments. We benefit from strong visibility into our future revenues and had backlog, which is our expected future revenue under all our customer contracts, of $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2009. Additionally, the long-term growth rate assumed in our discounted cash flow analysis could have declined significantly and we still would not have incurred an impairment to goodwill as of December 31, 2009, based upon our discounted cash flow analysis. Our projected cash flows were discounted using a weighted average discount rate of 10.5% based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital which included certain key inputs such as the average capital structures of comparable companies, specifically a market participant debt to equity ratio of 33.4% debt and 66.6% equity, and an equity risk premium of 5.5%, taking into account the current contraction in the economic environment. Trade N ame. We have implemented the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of the Intelsat trade name. The relief from royalty analysis is comprised of two major steps: i) a determination of the hypothetical royalty rate, and ii) the subsequent application of the royalty rate to projected revenue. In determining the hypothetical royalty rate utilized in the relief from royalty approach, we considered comparable license agreements, operating earnings benchmark rule of thumb, an excess earnings analysis to determine aggregate intangible asset earnings, and other qualitative factors. Based on our analysis, the fair value of the Intelsat trade name as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 was not impaired. The key assumptions used in our model to fair value the Intelsat trade name included the tax rate and discount rate. A change in the estimated tax rates or discount rate could result in future impairments. Orbital Locations. Intelsat is authorized by governments to operate satellites at certain orbital locations  i.e., longitudinal coordinates along the Clarke Belt. The Clarke Belt is the part of space approximately 42,165 kilometers above the plane of the equator where geostationary orbit may be achieved. Various governments acquire rights to these orbital locations through filings made with the ITU, a sub-organization of the United Nations. We will continue to have rights to operate at our orbital locations so long as we maintain our authorizations to do so. See BusinessRegulation and Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to Regulation. 84 Table of Contents Our rights to operate at orbital locations can be used and sold individually; however, since satellites and customers can be and are moved from one orbital location to another, our rights are used in conjunction with each other as a network that can change to meet the changing needs of our customers and market demands. Due to the interchangeable nature of orbital locations, the aggregate value of all of the orbital locations is used to measure the extent of impairment, if any. Assumptions and Approach Used. We determined the estimated fair value of our right to operate at orbital locations using the build up method, as described below, to determine the cash flows for the income approach, with the resulting projected cash flows discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. In instances where the build up method did not generate positive value for the rights to operate at an orbital location, but the right was expected to generate revenue, we assigned a value based upon independent source data for recent transactions of similar orbital locations. Under the build up approach, the amount an investor would be willing to pay for the right to operate a satellite business at an orbital location is calculated by first estimating the cash flows that typical market participants would assume could be available from the right to operate satellites using the subject location in a similar market. It is assumed that rather than acquiring such a business as a going concern, the buyer would hypothetically start with the right to operate at an orbital location and build a new operation with similar attributes from scratch. Thus the buyer/builder is considered to incur the start-up costs and losses typically associated with the going concern value and pay for all other tangible and intangible assets. Based upon our analysis, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009, we did not have an impairment of the orbital locations. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair values of our rights to operate at our orbital locations included: (i) market penetration leading to revenue growth, (ii) profit margin, (iii) duration and profile of the build up period, (iv) estimated start-up costs and losses incurred during the build up period and (v) weighted average cost of capital. Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets. We review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets to assess whether an impairment has occurred in accordance with the guidance provided under FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment , whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in our judgment, that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. These indicators of impairment can include, but are not limited to, the following:  satellite anomalies, such as a partial or full loss of power;  under-performance of an asset as compared to expectations; and  shortened useful lives due to changes in the way an asset is used or expected to be used. The recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Additionally, when assets are expected to be used in future periods, a shortened depreciable life may be utilized if appropriate, resulting in accelerated depreciation. Assumptions and Approach Used. We employ a discounted future cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our long lived intangible assets when an impairment assessment is 85 Table of Contents required. During 2009, there were no such anomalies or events requiring a full impairment analysis for an amortizable long-lived asset. Typically, in estimating the discounted cash flows for our satellites, we primarily use our internally prepared budgets and forecast information. The cash flows would then be discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. Therefore, typically a change in the estimated future cash flows could change our estimated fair value resulting in additional impairment when applicable. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the guidance provided under FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (FASB ASC 740). We are subject to income taxes in the United States as well as a number of foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of our deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. Under FASB ASC 740, a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based in part on the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize the deferred tax assets. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We evaluate our tax positions to determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and having access to all relevant facts and information. When a tax position does not meet the more likely than not standard, a liability is recorded for the entire amount of the unrecognized tax benefit. Additionally, for those tax positions that are determined more likely than not to be sustainable, we measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit more likely than not (determined by cumulative probability) to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Fair Value Measurements We estimate the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value for publicly traded instruments is determined using quoted market prices and, for non-publicly traded instruments, fair value is based upon composite pricing from a variety of sources, including market leading data providers, market makers, and leading brokerage firms. We have determined that the valuation measurement inputs for our publicly traded instruments represent unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets, and therefore, have been classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy framework established by FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (FASB ASC 820). We determined the inputs of our non-publicly traded instruments to be within Level 2 of the FASB ASC 820 hierarchy framework. On January 1, 2008, we prospectively adopted FASB ASC 820, which defines fair value as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosure of the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities, the inputs utilized in calculating valuation measurements, and the effect of the measurement of significant unobservable inputs on earnings, or changes in net assets, as of the measurement 86 Table of Contents date. FASB ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs utilized in the measurement and valuation of financial assets or liabilities as of the measurement date:  Level 1unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;  Level 2quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation; and  Level 3unobservable inputs based upon the reporting entitys internally developed assumptions which market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We performed an evaluation of our financial assets and liabilities that met the criteria of the disclosure requirements and fair value framework of FASB ASC 820. As a result of that evaluation, we identified investments in marketable securities, interest rate financial derivative instruments, embedded derivative instruments, and redeemable noncontrolling interest as having met such criteria. We account for our investments in marketable securities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320, InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities . All investments have been classified as available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and declines in fair value on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense), net within our consolidated statements of operations. Interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are included in interest expense, net and other income (expense), net, respectively, within the consolidated statements of operations. We determined that the valuation measurement inputs of these marketable securities represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and, accordingly, have classified such investments within Level 1 of the FASB ASC 820 hierarchy framework. The fair value of our interest rate financial derivative instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive to terminate the agreement at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates, the market expectation for future interest rates and current creditworthiness of both our counterparties and ourselves. Observable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation technique incorporate identical contractual notional amounts, fixed coupon rates, periodic terms for interest payments and contract maturity. Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments, if any, associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as the estimates of current credit spread, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us or our counterparties. We also considered the existence of offset provisions and other credit enhancements that serve to reduce the credit exposure associated with the asset or liability being fair valued. We have assessed the significance of the inputs of the credit valuation adjustments to the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We account for a contingent put option embedded within the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes under FASB ASC 815, bifurcating the put option from the debt host instrument and classifying it as a 87 Table of Contents derivative instrument. We estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative on the issuance date and subsequently revalue the derivative at the end of each reporting period, recognizing any change in fair value through earnings. We use a standard valuation technique whereby the critical assumptions and underlyings include the debt maturity date, issue price, coupon rate, change of control put price, and the estimated date of a change in control. We have identified the inputs used to calculate the fair value as Level 3 inputs and have concluded that the valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In accordance with the guidance provided in the Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity topic of the Codification regarding the classification and measurement of redeemable securities, we mark to market the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in New Dawn, a joint venture investment, a majority owned subsidiary which is a joint venture investment with Convergence Partners at each reporting period. Convergence Partners has at its option the ability to require Intelsat to buy its ownership interest at fair value subsequent to the operations of New Dawns assets for a period defined in a project and shareholders agreement (the New Dawn Project Agreement) that we entered into on June 2008 with Convergence Partners. We calculate the estimated amount that we would be required to pay to Convergence Partners as if the option was exercised using Level 3 inputs such as the discounted cash flows and reflect the value within mezzanine equity. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-1 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Topic 105), which establishes the Codification as the official single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP, superseding existing literature issued by the FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues Task Force and related literature. The Codification became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after September 15, 2009, after which only one level of authoritative U.S. GAAP exists and all other literature is considered non-authoritative. The Codification does not change existing U.S. GAAP. The Codification was effective for our third quarter 2009 financial statements and the principal impact on our financial statements is limited to disclosures as all future references to authoritative accounting literature will be referenced in accordance with the Codification. Pursuant to the provisions of Topic 105, we have updated references to U.S. GAAP in our financial statements issued for the period ended December 31, 2009. The adoption of Topic 105 did not impact our financial position or results of operations. Accounting pronouncements issued prior to the Codification will continue to be referenced by their original issuance reference for consistency with prior period filings. We have also provided the Codification topic into which the accounting guidance has been incorporated subsequent to its original issuance. In September 2009, the FASB amended the Revenue RecognitionMultiple Element Arrangements topic of the Codification. Currently, the absence of vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) or third party evidence (TPE) of the fair value of the undelivered item(s) in an arrangement with multiple deliverables is one of the most common reasons entities are unable to recognize revenue on items that have been delivered. The amendment modifies the fair value requirements by providing an alternative for establishing fair value of a deliverable. In instances where VSOE or TPE of the fair value for any of the deliverables in an arrangement is unavailable, the entity may develop a best estimate of the selling price for those deliverables and allocate the arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. Application of the residual method of allocating an arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted. Additionally, entities will be required to disclose more information about their multiple-element revenue arrangements. This amendment will be 88 Table of Contents effective and applied prospectively to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 with early adoption permitted. We have adopted the amended revenue recognition guidance during the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assetsan amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 166). Subsequent to the issuance of this accounting pronouncement, SFAS No. 166 has been incorporated into the Codification under the FASB ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing , which establishes accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets. SFAS No. 166 is intended to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements related to a transfer of financial assets, the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows, and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. SFAS No. 166 will be effective at the start of the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009. We have evaluated the requirements of SFAS No. 166 and noted that the adoption of SFAS No. 166 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS No. 167). Subsequent to the issuance of this accounting pronouncement, SFAS No. 167 has been incorporated into the Codification under the FASB ASC 810 Consolidations . SFAS No. 167 is intended to address the effects on certain provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept in SFAS No. 166 and constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those in which the accounting and disclosures under FIN 46(R) do not always provide timely and useful information about an entitys involvement in a variable interest entity. SFAS No. 167 will be effective at the start of the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009. We have evaluated the requirements of SFAS No. 167 and its effect to our unconsolidated variable interest entities, and the adoption of the standard has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Our customers use our services because of the distinct technical and economic benefits that satellite services provide for certain critical applications. Satellites provide a number of advantages over terrestrial communications systems, including the following:  Satellite beams effectively blanket service regions with bandwidth, enabling any user within a coverage area to have equal access to highly reliable bandwidth;  Efficient content distribution through the ability to broadcast high quality signals from a single location to many locations simultaneously;  The ability to extend beyond terrestrial network end points, or provide an alternative path to terrestrial infrastructure, thus avoiding points of congestion or unreliability;  Fast network deployments, with network performance easily replicated across each site regardless of geography or infrastructure, and efficient centralized control and management;  Superior end-to-end network availability as compared to the availability of terrestrial networks; and  Instant communications infrastructure for disaster recovery. There is a finite number of geostationary orbital slots in which FSS satellites can be located, and many orbital locations already hold operational satellites. The owners of these satellites operate them under coordination agreements designed to avoid interference with other operators satellites. 91 Table of Contents Today, there are only three FSS operators, including us, providing global services, which is increasingly important as multinationals and governments seek a one-stop solution for obtaining global connectivity. In addition, there are a number of operators with fewer satellites that provide regional and/or national services. Intelsat is the largest of any operator in terms of rights to orbital slots in the most valuable C- and Ku-band spectrums. We believe a number of trends are creating increasing demand for satellite services, expanding the FSS sector:  Globalization of economic activities is increasing the geographic expansion of corporations and the communications networks that support them and creating new audiences for content. Globalization also increases the communications requirements for governments supporting embassy and military applications.  Connectivity and broadband access are essential elements of infrastructure supporting the rapid economic growth of developing nations. Globally dispersed organizations are increasingly moving to satellite-based infrastructure to provide better access, reliability and control.  Proliferation of content and formats is resulting in increased bandwidth requirements as content owners seek to maximize distribution to multiple viewing audiences across multiple technologies. HDTV, 3DTV, Internet distribution of traditional television programming, IPTV and video to the handset are all examples of the expanding format and distribution requirements of media programmers.  Mobility applications , such as wireless phone services, maritime communications and aerial services, are fueling demand for bandwidth on the move. Rapid growth in cellular services for developing regions is expected to transition demand for voice only services to demand for data and video services over time, resulting in increased network bandwidth requirements. Given the low penetration of fixed-line telephone services in emerging markets and the introduction of smart phones and netbooks, Internet access in these markets may be primarily mobile. Significant technology advancements in aerial data and video services for government applications, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, also is resulting in increased demand for satellite-based bandwidth.

Satellite Systems There are three primary types of commercial communications satellite systems: low-earth orbit systems, medium-earth orbit systems and geosynchronous systems. All of our satellites are geosynchronous satellites and are located approximately 22,300 miles, or 35,700 kilometers, above the equator. These satellites can receive radio frequency communications from an origination point, relay those signals over great distances and distribute those signals to a single receiver or multiple receivers within the coverage areas of the satellites transmission beams. Geosynchronous satellites send these signals using various parts of the radio frequency spectrum. The spectrum available for use at each orbital location includes the following frequency bands in which most commercial satellite services are offered today:  C-band low power, broad beams requiring use of relatively larger antennae, valued as spectrum least susceptible to transmission impairments such as rain;  Ku-band high power, narrow to medium size beams facilitating use of smaller antennae favored by businesses, but somewhat less reliable due to weather-related impairments; and  Ka-band very high power, very narrow beams facilitating use of very small transmit/receive antennae, but less reliable due to high transmission impairments such as rain. The Ka-band is utilized for various applications, including broadband services. Substantially all of the station-kept satellites in our fleet are designed to provide capacity using the C- and/or Ku-bands of this spectrum. A geosynchronous satellite is referred to as geostationary, or station-kept, when it is operated within an assigned orbital control, or station-keeping box, which is defined by a specific range of latitudes and longitudes. Geostationary satellites revolve around the earth with a speed that corresponds to that of the earths rotation and appear to remain above a fixed point on the earths surface at all times. Geosynchronous satellites that are not station-kept are in inclined orbit. The daily north south motion of a satellite in inclined orbit exceeds the specified range of latitudes of its assigned station-keeping box, and the satellite appears to oscillate slowly, moving above and below the equator every day. An operator will typically operate a satellite in inclined orbit toward the end of its service life because the operator is able to save significant amounts of fuel by not controlling the north-south position of the satellite and is thereby able to substantially extend the service life of the satellite. The types of services and customers that can access an inclined orbit satellite have traditionally been limited due to the movement of the satellite relative to a fixed ground antenna, however, recent technology innovations now allow the use of inclined orbit capacity for certain applications. As a result, we anticipate demand for inclined orbit capacity may increase over the next few years if these applications are successfully introduced. As of December 31, 2009, eleven of our satellites were 105 Table of Contents operating in an inclined orbit, with most continuing to earn revenue beyond our original estimated life for each of these satellites. In-Orbit Satellites We believe that our strong operational performance is due primarily to our satellite procurement and operations philosophy. Our operations and engineering staff is involved from the design through the decommissioning of each satellite that we procure. Our staff works at the manufacturers and launchers sites to monitor progress, allowing us to maintain close technical collaboration with our contractors during the process of designing, manufacturing and launching a satellite. We continue our engineering involvement throughout the operating lifetime of each satellite. Extensive monitoring of earth station operations and around-the-clock satellite control and network operations support ensure our consistent operational quality, as well as timely corrections when problems occur. In addition, we have in place contingency plans for technical problems that may occur during the lifetime of a satellite. These features also contribute to the resilience of our network, which enables us to ensure the continuity of service that is important for our customers and to retain revenue in the event that we need to move customers to alternative capacity. The design flexibility of some of our satellites enables us to meet customer demand and respond to changing market conditions. As of December 31, 2009 our in-orbit fleet of satellites had 1,231 and 798 36-MHz equivalent transponders available for transmitting in the C-band and the Ku-band, respectively. These totals measure transponders on station-kept satellites. The average system fill factor for our satellites, which represents the percentage of our total available transponder capacity that is in use or that is reserved at a given time (including guaranteed reservations for service), was 83.1% as of December 31, 2009. The design life of a satellite is the length of time that the satellites hardware is designed by the manufacturer to remain operational under normal operating conditions. In contrast, a satellites orbital maneuver life is the length of time the satellite has enough fuel to remain operational. A satellites service life is based upon fuel levels and other considerations, including power. Satellites launched in the recent past are generally expected to remain in service for the lesser of maneuver life or 16 years. Satellites typically have enough fuel to maintain between 16 and 18 years of station-kept operations. The average remaining service life of our satellites was approximately 8.1 years as of December 31, 2009 weighted on the basis of nominally available capacity for the station-kept satellites we own. 106 Table of Contents Planned Satellites As of March 31, 2010 we had orders for the following eight satellites including the Intelsat New Dawn satellite, of which six are replacement satellites. Generally, these satellites are being built over a period of three years. In the following table, a replacement satellite refers to a planned satellite of which certain customers may have the option of continuity of service between the existing satellite operating at the designated role and the planned satellite.

To be located at 33°E. Q4 2010 Arianespace Launch Services Agreements During the third quarter of 2008, we entered into a launch services agreement with Sea Launch providing for up to four satellite launches. Sea Launch has filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. See Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to Our IndustryOur dependence on outside contractors could result in increased costs and delays related to the launch of our new satellites, which would in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Future Satellites We would expect to replace other existing satellites, as necessary, with satellites that meet customer needs and that have a compelling economic rationale. We periodically conduct evaluations to determine the current and projected strategic and economic value of our existing and any planned satellites and to guide us in redeploying satellite resources as appropriate. Network Operations and Current Ground Facilities We control and operate each of our satellites and manage the communications services for which each satellite is used from the time of its initial deployment through the end of its operational life, and we believe that our technical skill in performing these critical operations 107 Table of Contents differentiates us from our competition. We provide most of these services from our satellite operations centers in Washington, D.C. and Long Beach, California and our customer service center in Ellenwood, Georgia. In the event of a natural disaster or other situation disabling one of the facilities, each satellite operations center has the functional ability to provide instantaneous restoration of services on behalf of the other, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our network. Utilizing state-of-the-art satellite command and control hardware and software, our satellite operations centers analyze telemetry from our satellites in order to monitor their status and track their location. Our satellite operations centers use a network of ground facilities to perform their functions. This network includes 17 earth stations (TT&C stations) that provide TT&C services for our satellites and various other earth stations worldwide. Through our ground facilities, we constantly monitor signal quality, protect bandwidth from piracy or other interference and maintain customer installed equipment. Our customer service center located in Ellenwood, Georgia includes a specialized video operations center, data operations center, and rapid access center. This facility is responsible for managing the communications services that we provide to our customers and is the first point of contact for customers needing assistance in using our network. We also maintain a back-up operations facility and data center a relatively short distance from our Washington, D.C. facility in Hagerstown, Maryland. This facility provides back-up emergency operational services in the event that our Ellenwood, Georgia customer service center experiences an interruption. We have invested heavily in our fully integrated terrestrial network which complements our satellite network. Our network includes teleport, leased fiber and network performance monitoring systems and enables us to provide end-to-end managed solutions to our customers. In addition to leased fiber connecting high-density routes, our ground network also features strategically located points of presence, which are drop-off points for our customers traffic that are close to major interconnection hubs for telecommunications applications, video transmissions and trunking to the Internet backbone. We are enhancing our terrestrial network to an all IP network environment that will improve our ground support of high bandwidth applications such as HD video. We believe the CISCO-based network architecture will effectively allow us to converge our media and network services terrestrial network infrastructures, resulting in reduced costs, and will provide opportunities for generating additional revenue from existing and new customers by bundling combinations of media and network services products that can be offered through a single access circuit into our network. Capacity Sparing and Backup and General Satellite Risk Management As part of our satellite risk management, we continually evaluate, and design plans to mitigate, the areas of greatest risk within our fleet, especially for those satellites with known technical risks. We believe that the availability of spare transponder services capacity, together with the overlapping coverage areas of our satellites and flexible satellite design features described in Satellite Systems above, are important aspects of our ability to provide reliable service to our customers. In addition, these factors could help us to mitigate the financial impact to our operations attributable to the occurrence of a major satellite anomaly, including the loss of a satellite. Although we do not maintain backup for all of our transponder services operating capacity, we maintain some form of backup capacity for each satellite designated as being in primary operating service. Our restoration backup capacity may include any one or more of the following:  designated reserve transponders on the satellite or other on-board backup systems or designed-in redundancies, 108 Table of Contents  an in-orbit spare satellite, or  interim restoration capacity on other satellites. In addition, we provide some capacity on a preemptible basis and could preempt the use of this capacity to provide backup capacity in the event of a loss of a satellite. We typically obtain launch insurance for our satellites at the time of launch and will decide whether or not to obtain such insurance taking into consideration launch insurance rates, terms of available coverage and alternative risk management strategies, including the availability of backup satellites and transponders in the event of a launch failure. Launch insurance coverage is typically in an amount equal to the fully capitalized cost of the satellite, which generally includes the construction costs, the portion of the insurance premium related to launch, the cost of the launch services and capitalized interest (but may exclude any unpaid incentive payments to the manufacturer). Five of the satellites in our fleet are covered by in-orbit insurance. In-orbit insurance coverage may initially be for an amount comparable to launch insurance levels, generally decreases over time and is typically based on the declining book value of the satellite. We do not currently insure against lost revenue in the event of a total or partial loss of a satellite. One of the five insured satellites, Galaxy 13/Horizons-1, was covered by an insurance policy with substantial exclusions or exceptions to coverage for failures of specific components identified by the underwriters as at risk for possible failure, primarily related to XIPS related anomalies (Significant Exclusion Policies). The Significant Exclusion Policies reduce the probability of an insurance recovery in the event of a loss on this satellite. Sales, Marketing and Distribution Channels Our company tagline, Closer, by far, describes the close working relationship we strive to build with our customers. Our Intelsat Global Sales & Marketing Ltd. subsidiary (Intelsat Global Sales), located in London, England, is our global sales and marketing headquarters. In addition, we have established local sales and marketing support offices in the following locations around the world:  Australia  Japan  Brazil  Mexico  China  Singapore  France  South Africa  Germany  United Arab Emirates  India  United States By establishing local offices closer to our customers and staffing those offices with experienced personnel, we believe that we are able to provide flexible and responsive service and technical support to our customers. Our sales and marketing organization reflects our corporate focus on our three principal customer sets of network services, media and government. Our sales team includes technical marketing and sales engineering application expertise and a sales approach focused on creating integrated solutions for our customers communications requirements. We use a range of direct and wholesale distribution methods to sell our services, depending upon the region, applicable regulatory requirements and customer application. 109 Table of Contents Satellite Health and Technology Our satellite fleet is diversified by manufacturer and satellite type, and as a result, our fleet is generally healthy, with 99.9998% availability of station-kept satellite capacity during the year ended December 31, 2009. We have experienced some technical problems with our current fleet but have been able to minimize the impact of these problems on our customers, our operations and our business in recent years. Many of these problems have been component failures and anomalies that have had little long-term impact to date on the overall transponder availability in our satellite fleet. All of our satellites have been designed to accommodate an anticipated rate of equipment failures with adequate redundancy to meet or exceed their orbital design lives, and to date, this redundancy design scheme has proven effective. After each anomaly we have generally restored services for our customers on the affected satellite, provided alternative capacity on other satellites in our fleet, or provided capacity that we purchased from other satellite operators. Significant Anomalies On January 14, 2005, our IS-804 satellite experienced a sudden and unexpected electrical power system anomaly that resulted in the total loss of the satellite. IS-804 was a Lockheed Martin 7000 series (the LM 7000 series) satellite, and as of December 31, 2009 we operated three other satellites in the LM 7000 series, IS-801, IS-802 and IS-805. Of these three satellites, only IS-805 remains in a primary role. Based on the report of the failure review board that we established with Lockheed Martin Corporation, we believe that the IS-804 failure was not likely to have been caused by an IS-804 specific workmanship or hardware element, but was most likely caused by a high current event in the battery circuitry triggered by an electrostatic discharge that propagated to cause the sudden failure of the high voltage power system. We therefore believe that although this risk exists for our other LM 7000 series satellites, the risk of any individual satellite having a similar anomaly is low. On September 21, 2006, our IS-802 satellite experienced a reduction of electrical power capability that resulted in a degraded capability of the satellite. A substantial subset of transponders on IS-802 were subsequently reactivated and are operating normally. The anomaly review board that we established with Lockheed Martin Corporation to investigate the cause of the anomaly concluded that the IS-802 anomaly was most likely caused by an electrical short internal to the solar array harness located on the south solar array boom. The anomaly review board found that this anomaly was significantly different from previous LM 7000 series spacecraft failures and was the first failure of this type on a solar array of the LM 7000 series. We therefore believe that although this risk exists for our other LM 7000 series satellites, the risk of any individual satellite having a similar anomaly is low. On November 28, 2004, our Galaxy 27 satellite experienced a sudden anomaly in its north electrical distribution system which resulted in the loss of control of the satellite and the interruption of customer services on the satellite. Galaxy 27 is an FS 1300 series satellite manufactured by SS/L. Our engineers were able to regain command and control of Galaxy 27, and it was placed back in service, with reduced payload capacity, following operational testing. We have determined that the north electrical distribution system on Galaxy 27 and the communications capacity associated with it are not operational, and the satellite has lost redundancy in nearly all of its components. As a result, Galaxy 27 faces an increased risk of loss in the future. As of December 31, 2009, a substantial subset of Galaxy 27s transponders, which are all powered by the south electrical distribution system, have been tested, are performing normally and are available for service to our customers. Some of these transponders are currently being used by our customers. 110 Table of Contents On June 29, 2008, our Galaxy 26 satellite experienced a sudden and unexpected electrical distribution anomaly causing the loss of a substantial portion of the satellite power generating capability and resulting in the interruption of some of the customer services on the satellite. Galaxy 26 is also an FS 1300 series satellite. Certain transponders continue to operate normally. However, the anomaly resulted in a reduction to the estimated remaining useful life of the satellite. With respect to both the Galaxy 27 and Galaxy 26 anomalies, the failure review boards that we established with SS/L identified the likely root cause of the anomalies as a design flaw which is affected by a number of parameters and in some extreme cases can result in an electrical system anomaly. The design flaw also exists on IS-8. This satellite has been in service since November 1998 and has not experienced an electrical system anomaly. Along with the manufacturer, we continually monitor this problem and we have ordered a replacement for IS-8 expected to be launched in 2012. On April 5, 2010, our Galaxy 15 satellite experienced an anomaly. We have transitioned all media traffic on this satellite to our Galaxy 12 satellite, which is the designated in-orbit spare for the North American region. G-15 is an Orbital Star satellite manufactured by Orbital Sciences Corporation. Along with the manufacturer, we are conducting a technical investigation with respect to the anomaly. As of March 31, 2010, G-15 had a net book value of $142.4 million and related performance incentive obligations of $3.8 million. Other Anomalies We have also identified three other types of common anomalies among the satellite models in our fleet, which have had an operational impact in the past and could, if they materialize, have an impact in the future. These are:  failure of the SCP in Boeing 601 (BSS 601) satellites;  failure of the on-board XIPS used to maintain the in-orbit position of Boeing 601 High Power Series (BSS 601 HP) satellites; and  accelerated solar array degradation in early Boeing 702 (BSS 702) satellites. SCP Failures. Many of our satellites use an on-board SCP to provide automatic on-board control of many operational functions. SCPs are a critical component in the operation of such satellites. Each such satellite has a backup SCP, which is available in the event of a failure of the primary SCP. Certain BSS 601 satellites have experienced SCP failures. The risk of SCP failure appears to decline as these satellites age. As of December 31, 2009, we operated five BSS 601 satellites: HGS-3, which is utilized by a third-party, IS-2, IS-3R, IS-4, which had previously experienced primary SCP failure and was operating on its backup SCP, and IS-26. These satellites have been identified as having heightened susceptibility to the SCP problem. On February 1, 2010, the backup SCP on IS-4 failed, resulting in a loss of the spacecraft. IS-4 carried commercial traffic and operated in a secondary role. Its failure did not cause a significant interruption of our business or require replacement of a satellite. IS-2, IS-3R and IS-26 have been in continuous operation since 1994, 1996 and 1997, respectively. Both primary and backup SCPs on these satellites are monitored regularly and remain fully functional. Accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that additional SCP failures will occur; however, should they occur, we do not anticipate an interruption in business or early replacement of these satellites as a result. 111 Table of Contents BSS 601 HP XIPS. The BSS 601 HP satellite uses XIPS as its primary propulsion system. There are two separate XIPS on each BSS 601 HP, each one of which is capable of maintaining the satellite in its orbital position. The satellite also has a completely independent bi-propellant propulsion system as a backup to the XIPS. As a result, the failure of a XIPS on a BSS 601 HP typically would have no effect on the satellites performance or its operating life. However, the failure of both XIPS would require the use of the backup bi-propellant propulsion system, which could result in a shorter operating life for the satellite depending on the amount of bi-propellant fuel remaining. XIPS failures do not typically result in a catastrophic failure of the satellite or affect the communications capability of the satellite. As of December 31, 2009, we operated four BSS 601 HP satellites, IS-5, IS-9, IS-10 and Galaxy 13/Horizons-1. IS-5 and Galaxy 13/Horizons-1 continue to have both XIPS available as their primary propulsion system. IS-9 and IS-10 have experienced the failure of both XIPS and are operating on their backup bi-propellant systems. These two satellites are expected to be replaced by 2012. Our BSS 601 HP satellites had available bi-propellant fuel for a range of approximately two and a half to eight years from December 31, 2009. No assurance can be given that we will not have further XIPS failures that result in shortened satellite lives. We have decommissioned three satellites that had experienced failure of both XIPS. IS-6B was replaced by IS-11 during the first quarter of 2008, Galaxy 10R was replaced by Galaxy 18 during the second quarter of 2008, and Galaxy 4R was decommissioned in March 2009. BSS 702 Solar Arrays. All of our satellites have solar arrays that power their operating systems and transponders and recharge the batteries used when solar power is not available. Solar array performance typically degrades over time in a predictable manner. Additional power margins and other operational flexibility are designed into satellites to allow for such degradation without loss of performance or operating life. Certain BSS 702 satellites have experienced greater than anticipated degradation of their solar arrays resulting from the design of the solar arrays. Such degradation, if continued, results in a shortened operating life of a satellite or the need to reduce the use of the communications payload. As of December 31, 2009, we operated three BSS 702 satellites, two of which are affected by accelerated solar array degradation, Galaxy 11 and IS-1R. Service to customers has not been affected, and we expect that both of these satellites will continue to serve customers until we replace or supplement them with new satellites. Along with the manufacturer, we continually monitor the problem to determine its cause and its expected effect. Due to this continued degradation, Galaxy 11s estimated end of service life is April 2015 and IS-1Rs estimated end of service life is February 2016. Both satellites are currently operating in secondary roles. The third BSS 702 satellite that we operated as of December 31, 2009, Galaxy 3C, was launched after the solar array anomaly was identified, and it has a substantially different solar array design intended to eliminate the problem. This satellite has been in service since September 2002 and has not experienced similar degradation problems. Competition We compete in the communications market for the provision of video, data and voice connectivity worldwide. Communications services are provided using various communications technologies, including satellite networks, which provide services as a substitute for, or as a complement to, the capabilities of terrestrial networks. See The FSS Sector above for a description of the FSS sector generally and the advantages of satellite communications. We are a satellite operator that operates worldwide. Our competition includes providers of fixed satellite services of varying size. We also face significant competition from suppliers of terrestrial communications capacity. We compete with other satellite operators for both point- 112 Table of Contents to-multipoint and point-to-point services. We compete with fiber optic cable operators principally for point-to-point services. We also face competition from resellers of FSS and fiber capacity. Resellers purchase FSS or fiber capacity from current or future providers and then resell the capacity to their customers. Capacity for resale is readily available because resellers can typically procure capacity on short notice, given that FSS and fiber capacity is available. We compete with providers of terrestrial fiber optic cable capacity on certain routes and networks. As a result, we have been experiencing, and expect to continue to experience, a decline in our channel product revenue due to the build-out of fiber optic cable capacity. However, we believe that satellites have advantages over fiber optic cables in certain regions and for certain applications. The primary use of fiber optic cable is carrying high-volume communications traffic from point to point, and fiber capacity is available at substantially lower prices than satellite capacity once operational. Consequently, the growth in fiber optic cable capacity on point-to-point transoceanic routes, particularly across the Atlantic Ocean, has led voice, data and video contribution customers that require service between major city hubs to migrate from satellite to fiber optic cable. However, satellite capacity remains competitive for signals that need to be transmitted beyond the main termination points of fiber optic cable, for point-to-multipoint transmissions and for signals seeking to bypass congested terrestrial networks. Satellite capacity is also competitive in parts of the world where providing fiber optic cable capacity is not yet cost-effective or is physically not feasible. We believe that in those applications and regions where we do compete with fiber optic cable companies, the basis for competition is primarily price. Regulation As an operator of privately owned global satellite systems, we are subject to U.S. government regulation; regulation by foreign national telecommunications authorities; and the ITU frequency coordination process and regulations. U.S. Government Regulation FCC Regulation . Almost all of the satellites in our current constellation are licensed and regulated by the FCC. We have final or temporary FCC authorization for all of our U.S.-licensed operating satellites. Satellite licenses typically have a fifteen-year term. At the end of a license term, we can request special temporary authorization or a license modification to continue operating a satellite. In addition, our FCC satellite licenses which relate to use of those orbital locations and associated frequencies that were transferred to the United States at the time of our privatization in July 2001 are conditioned on our remaining a signatory to the Public Services Agreement with the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization described below under Our HistoryThe Privatization. Furthermore, any transfer of these licenses by us to a third party or a successor-in-interest is only permitted if such third party or successor-in-interest has undertaken to perform our obligations under the Public Services Agreement. Changes to our satellite system generally require prior FCC approval. From time to time, we have pending applications for permanent or temporary changes in orbital locations, frequencies and technical design. From time to time, we also file applications for replacement or additional satellites. Replacement satellite applications are eligible for streamlined processing if they are unopposed and propose technical characteristics consistent with those of the satellite that is being replaced. In the case of additional FSS geostationary satellites, the FCC processes requests for new orbital locations or frequencies on a first come, first served basis and requires 113 Table of Contents licensees to post a $3.0 million bond and to comply with a schedule of progress milestones, establishing deadlines to sign a satellite construction contract; complete critical design review; begin spacecraft construction; and launch and operate the satellite. Upon completion of each milestone, the amount of the bond is reduced proportionately. A satellite licensee not satisfying a milestone will lose its license and must forfeit the remaining amount on its bond absent circumstances warranting a milestone extension under the FCCs rules and policies. We have subsidiaries that hold other FCC licenses, including earth station licenses associated with technical facilities located in several states and in Washington, D.C. We must pay FCC filing fees in connection with our space station and earth station applications, and we must also pay annual regulatory fees to the FCC. Violations of the FCCs rules can result in various sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations or the denial of applications for new authorizations or the renewal of existing authorizations. We are not regulated as a common carrier for most of our activities, therefore we are not subject to rate regulation or the obligation not to discriminate among customers and we operate most of our activities with minimal governmental scrutiny of our business decisions. One of our subsidiaries is regulated as a common carrier. Common carriers are subject to FCC requirements, which include: traffic and revenue reports, international circuit status reports, international interconnected private line reports, notification and approval for foreign carrier affiliations, filing of contracts with international carriers, annual financial reports, equal employment opportunity reports, assistance for law enforcement and maintenance of customer billing records for 18 months. We currently qualify for exemptions from several of these reporting requirements. U.S. Export Control Requirements and Sanctions Regulation. We must comply with U.S. export control laws and regulations, specifically the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations and the trade sanctions laws and regulations in the operation of our business. The export of satellites, satellite hardware, defense services and technical information relating to satellites to non-U.S. satellite manufacturing firms, launch services providers, insurers, customers, employees and other non-U.S. persons is regulated by the U.S. Department of States Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), under the ITAR. Certain of our contracts for the manufacture, launch, operation and insurance of our satellites involve the export to non-U.S. persons of technical data or hardware regulated by the ITAR. We have obtained all of the specific DDTC authorizations currently needed in order to fulfill our obligations under contracts with non-U.S. entities, and we believe that the terms of these licenses are sufficient given the scope and duration of the contracts to which they pertain. Many of our employees are non-U.S. nationals. We have obtained a license from the DDTC to allow certain of our non-U.S. national employees access to our technical information that is controlled under the ITAR. The U.S. Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security also regulates some of our activities under the Export Administration Regulations. The Bureau regulates our export of equipment to earth stations in our ground network located outside of the United States. It is our practice to obtain all licenses necessary for the furnishing of original or spare equipment for the operation of our TT&C stations in a timely manner in order to facilitate the shipment of this equipment when needed. We cannot provide services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Where required, the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control has granted us the authorizations needed to provide satellite capacity and related administrative services to U.S.-sanctioned countries. 114 Table of Contents U.S. Department of Defense Security Clearances. To participate in classified U.S. government programs, we sought and obtained security clearances for one of our subsidiaries from the U.S. Department of Defense as required under the national security laws and regulations of the United States by entering into a proxy agreement with the U.S. government. Because Intelsat S.A. is a Luxembourg company, and prior to the Migration was a Bermuda company, with significant non-U.S. investment and employees, we sought and obtained Department of Defense approval of various mechanisms to mitigate the impact on the required security clearances. If we do not maintain the security clearances that we have obtained from the U.S. Department of Defense, we will not be able to perform our obligations under any classified U.S. government contracts to which our subsidiary is a party, the U.S. government would have the right to terminate our contracts requiring access to classified information and we will not be able to enter into new classified contracts. Further, if we materially violate the terms of the proxy agreement, the subsidiary holding the security clearances may be suspended or debarred from performing any government contracts, whether classified or unclassified. Regulation by Foreign National Telecommunications Authorities U.K. Regulation. The United Kingdom is the licensing jurisdiction for the BSS portion of the Ku-band on the IS-805 satellite. Satellite operators in the United Kingdom are regulated by the U.K.s Office of Communications. Papua New Guinea Regulation. The Papua New Guinea Telecommunication Authority (PANGTEL) is the licensing jurisdiction for our use of the C-band payload on the Galaxy 23 satellite. We are required to pay fees to PANGTEL in connection with our use of this orbital location. German Regulation . We hold licenses for several earth stations in Germany, as well as authorizations to operate the IS-12, IS-601 and IS-24 satellites at two orbital locations. South African Regulation . We also hold a license for an earth station in South Africa. Japan Regulation. We and JSAT are the sole members of Horizons and in 2002 the Japanese telecommunications ministry authorized Horizons to operate the Ku-band payload on the Galaxy 13/Horizons-1 satellite. In 2003, the FCC added this Ku-band payload to its Permitted Space Station List, enabling Horizons to use the payload to provide non-DTH services in the United States, and in May 2004, the FCC expanded this authority to include one-way DTH services. We are the exclusive owner of the C-band payload on Galaxy 13/Horizons-1, which the FCC has licensed us to operate. Other National Telecommunications Authorities . As a provider of satellite capacity, we are also subject to the national communications and broadcasting laws and regulations of many foreign countries in which we operate. Most countries require us to obtain a license or other form of written authorization from the regulator prior to offering service. We have obtained or are obtaining these licenses or written authorizations in all countries in which they are required. Most countries allow authorized telecommunications providers to own their own transmission facilities and to purchase satellite capacity without restriction, facilitating customer access to our services. Other countries maintain strict monopoly regimes or otherwise regulate the provision of our services. In order to provide services in these countries, we may need to negotiate an operating agreement with a monopoly entity that covers the types of services to be offered by each party, the contractual terms for service and each partys rates. As we have developed our ground network and expanded our service offerings, we have been required to 115 Table of Contents obtain additional licenses and authorizations. To date, we believe that we have identified and complied with all of the regulatory requirements applicable to us in connection with our ground network and expanded services. The International Telecommunication Union Frequency Coordination Process and Regulation Our use of orbital locations is subject to the frequency coordination and recording process of the ITU. In order to protect satellite systems from harmful radio frequency interference from other satellite systems, the ITU maintains a Master International Frequency Register of radio frequency assignments and their associated orbital locations. Each ITU notifying administration is required by treaty to give notice of, coordinate and record its proposed use of radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations with the ITUs Radiocommunication Bureau. When the coordination process is completed, the ITU formally notifies all proposed users of frequencies and orbital locations in order to protect the recorded assignments associated with a given orbital location from subsequent or nonconforming interfering uses by Member States of the ITU. The ITUs Radio Regulations do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms. The Radio Regulations arbitration procedure is voluntary and neither the ITU specifically, nor international law generally, provides clear remedies if this voluntary process fails. Only nations have full standing as ITU members. Therefore, we must rely on governments to represent our interests before the ITU, including obtaining new rights to use orbital locations and resolving disputes relating to the ITUs regulations. Employees As of December 31, 2009, we had 1,111 full-time regular employees. These employees consisted of:  523 employees in engineering, operations and related information systems;  280 employees in finance, legal, corporate information systems and other administrative functions;  217 employees in sales, marketing and strategy; and  91 employees in support of government sales and marketing. As of December 31, 2009, 991 of these employees were located in the United States, and the remainder of our employees were in various other locations around the world. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees is represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the cleanup of contamination. As an owner or operator of property and in connection with current and historical operations at some of our sites, we could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. For instance, some of our operations require continuous power supply, and, as a result, current and past operations at our teleport and other technical facilities include fuel storage and batteries for back-up power generators. We believe, however, that our operations are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations. 116 Table of Contents Our History Intelsat, Ltd. was the successor entity to the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (the IGO). The IGO was a public intergovernmental organization created on an interim basis by its initial member states in 1964 and formally established in February 1973 upon entry into force of an intergovernmental agreement. The member states that were party to the treaty governing the IGO designated certain entities, known as the Signatories, to market and use the IGOs communications system within their territories and to hold investment share in the IGO. Signatories were either private telecommunications entities or governmental agencies of the applicable partys country or territory. Some Signatories authorized certain other entities located within their territories that used the IGOs satellite system, known as the Investing Entities, to invest in the IGO as well. Both Signatories and Investing Entities made capital contributions to the IGO and received capital repayments from the IGO in proportion to their investment share in the IGO. Signatories and Investing Entities were also the IGOs principal customers. Each Signatorys and Investing Entitys investment share in the IGO was based on its level of use of the IGOs satellite system as compared to the use by other Signatories and Investing Entities. As a public intergovernmental organization, the IGO was exempt from various taxes and enjoyed privileges, exemptions and immunities in many of its member states. However, due to its status as an intergovernmental organization, the IGOs business was subject to certain operating restrictions. For example, the IGO could not own or operate its own earth stations or provide retail services directly to end users in certain countries. It also could not set market-based pricing for its services or engage in business relationships with non-Signatories without first obtaining Signatory approval. The Privatization Our management began contemplating privatization in the mid-1990s in order to be able to operate our business free of the restrictions described above and to better position us to be responsive to a number of commercial, competitive and regulatory forces. In November 2000, the IGOs Assembly of Parties unanimously approved our managements specific plan for our privatization and set the date of privatization for July 18, 2001. On July 18, 2001, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the IGO were transferred to us. The privatization required the amendment of the two formal agreements establishing the IGO. These two agreements were the Agreement Relating to the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization INTELSAT, known as the INTELSAT Agreement, and the Operating Agreement Relating to the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization INTELSAT, known as the Operating Agreement, which both entered into force in February 1973. Because the process to formally ratify the amendments to the INTELSAT Agreement was expected to be lengthy, the IGOs Assembly of Parties decided to provisionally apply, or rapidly implement, the amendments on a consensus basis with effect from July 18, 2001, pending their formal ratification. Formal entry into force of the amendments to the INTELSAT Agreement occurred on November 30, 2004. Upon our privatization, each Signatory and Investing Entity that executed and delivered the required privatization agreements, including a shareholders agreement, received shares in Intelsat, Ltd. in proportion to its investment share in the IGO. The IGO, referred to post-privatization as the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO), continues to exist as an intergovernmental organization and will continue to exist as such for a period of at least 12 years after July 18, 2001, and then may be 117 Table of Contents terminated by a decision of a governing body of ITSO called the Assembly of Parties. Pursuant to a Public Services Agreement among ITSO and Intelsat, Ltd. and certain of our subsidiaries, we have an obligation to provide our services in a manner consistent with the core principles of global coverage and connectivity, lifeline connectivity and non-discriminatory access, and ITSO monitors our implementation of this obligation. These core principles are described below under Certain Customer Service AgreementsNovation Agreements and Certain Customer Service AgreementsLifeline Connectivity Obligation Contracts. The 2005 Acquisition Transactions On January 28, 2005, Intelsat, Ltd. was acquired by Intelsat Holdings for total cash consideration of approximately $3.2 billion, with pre-acquisition debt of approximately $1.9 billion remaining outstanding. Intelsat Holdings was initially formed as a Bermuda company at the direction of funds advised by or associated with Apax Partners Worldwide LLP and Apax Partners, L.P., Apollo Management V, L.P., MDP Global Investors Limited, and Permira Advisers LLC (collectively, the Former Sponsors). The PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions On August 28, 2005, Intelsat Bermuda, PanAmSat Holdco and Proton Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intelsat Bermuda, signed a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Intelsat Bermuda acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in PanAmSat Holdco for $25.00 per common share in cash, or approximately $3.2 billion in the aggregate (plus approximately $0.00927 per share as the pro rata share of undeclared regular quarterly dividends). Upon completion of the acquisition on July 3, 2006, PanAmSat Holdco and Intelsat Sub Holdco became separate direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Intelsat Bermuda. As part of this transaction, approximately $3.2 billion in existing debt of PanAmSat Holdco and its subsidiaries was either refinanced or remained outstanding. The acquisition and the related transactions are referred to collectively as the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions. Concurrently with the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat General, the entity that operates our government services business, purchased the government services business of PanAmSat. The New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions On February 4, 2008, Serafina completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity ownership of Intelsat Holdings (the New Sponsors Acquisition) for total cash consideration of approximately $5.0 billion, pursuant to a share purchase agreement among Serafina, Intelsat Holdings, certain shareholders of Intelsat Holdings and Serafina Holdings (the BC Share Purchase Agreement). Serafina Holdings is an entity formed by funds controlled by BC Partners Holdings Limited (the BCEC Funds) and certain other investors. Subsequent to the execution of the BC Share Purchase Agreement, two investment funds controlled by Silver Lake and other equity investors joined the BCEC Funds as the equity sponsors of Serafina Holdings. We refer to the BCEC Funds, the Silver Lake funds and the other equity sponsors collectively as the New Sponsors. As a result of completion of the New Sponsors Acquisition and related financing transactions, we and our subsidiaries assumed aggregate net incremental debt of approximately $3.7 billion. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsImpact of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions. The Luxembourg Migration On December 15, 2009, Intelsat, Ltd. and certain of its parent holding companies and subsidiaries migrated their jurisdiction of organization from Bermuda to Luxembourg (the Migration). As a result of the Migration, our headquarters are located in Luxembourg. Each 118 Table of Contents company that migrated has continued its corporate and legal personality in Luxembourg. Subsequent to the Migration, Intelsat Global, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat Global S.A., Intelsat Global Subsidiary, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat Global Subsidiary S.A., Intelsat Holdings, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat Holdings S.A., Intelsat, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat S.A., Intelsat (Bermuda), Ltd. is now known as Intelsat (Luxembourg) S.A., Intelsat Jackson Holdings, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A., Intelsat Intermediate Holding Company, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat Intermediate Holding Company S.A. and Intelsat Subsidiary Holding Company, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat Subsidiary Holding Company S.A. Certain Customer Service Agreements Our Intelsat Global Sales subsidiary is the contracting party for certain of our customer service agreements. For regulatory reasons, some of our Brazilian customers contract with our Brazilian subsidiaries. Our U.S., Canadian and Caribbean customers enter into agreements with certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. References to our, we and us below in our discussion of our service agreements are to the Intelsat entities that are the actual contracting parties to the service agreements. Our customers generally obtain satellite capacity from us by placing an order pursuant to one of several master customer service agreements. These agreements offer different service types, including transponder services, managed services, mobile satellite services and channel. For a description of these service types and a breakdown of our revenue by service type, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRevenue and Results of Operations. Most customer service commitments entered into prior to our privatization were transferred to us from the IGO pursuant to novation agreements. Since the privatization, our customers generally order services pursuant to master service agreements. The novation agreements and the master service agreements that Intelsat entered into in connection with the privatization contain provisions that restrict certain aspects of our business. These provisions are described below. Following our privatization, we have entered into master service agreements that do not contain these types of restrictions. Novation Agreements Each Intelsat novation agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which the service commitments entered into prior to the privatization are provided and the same terms and conditions generally apply to all customer service commitments transferred by the IGO pursuant to a novation agreement. Certain outstanding customer commitments represented in our December 31, 2009 backlog are covered by novation agreements. Approximately 1.5% of our backlog is covered by LCO protection. Although our backlog could be reduced if our LCO protection obligations are triggered, LCO has not had a significant impact on our backlog to date. Lifeline Connectivity Obligation Contracts In connection with our privatization, customers that novated service commitments and that met specified eligibility criteria had the option of entering into LCO contracts. An LCO contract provides price and capacity protection for a covered service commitment until the earlier of July 18, 2013 or the expiration of the commitment, which may be renewed as many times as required up to July 18, 2013 at a price no higher than the price charged for that service on the privatization date. Our customers cannot elect to receive LCO protection on contracts effective after the privatization date, except in limited circumstances. As of December 31, 2009, 119 Table of Contents approximately 1.5% of the outstanding customer commitments in our backlog were LCO- protected. The LCO contracts obligate us, in some circumstances, to reduce the prices we charge for covered service commitments, based on the cumulative price increases and decreases of our non-LCO protected service commitments against a specified pricing index calculated annually on July 18. Because the cumulative decrease in pricing to non-LCO customers through July 18, 2009 has been less than 15%, we have not as of yet been required to reduce prices for our LCO-protected service commitments. Pursuant to a Public Services Agreement that Intelsat entered into with ITSO in connection with the privatization, ITSO monitors our implementation of the LCO protections. Under the Public Services Agreement, we are obligated to provide our services in a manner consistent with the core principles of global coverage and connectivity, lifeline connectivity and non-discriminatory access. Global coverage and connectivity refers to the principle that our satellite system should provide the maximum coverage of the earth available from satellites in geostationary orbit and that it should have sufficient interconnection capabilities to make communication possible within and between Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Lifeline connectivity refers to the principle that we should make our satellite system available at protected price levels to users in low income countries, countries with low teledensity and other countries that are dependent on our system for access to international telecommunications services. Non-discriminatory access refers to the principle that all entities should have a fair and equal opportunity to access our satellite system. Legal Proceedings We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, but management does not believe that the resolution of any pending proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 120 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT Executive Officers and Directors Information regarding our current executive officers and directors is set forth below.

Board Leadership Structure Our board of directors is led by a Chairman who is a Managing Partner of a private equity firm that is affiliated with entities that own or control more than 70% of the outstanding equity of Intelsat Global. Our Chief Executive Officer is also the Deputy Chairman of our board, and has an employment agreement pursuant to which he reports to the board of directors. The separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions is appropriate for a privately-held company such as ours. 123 Table of Contents Audit Committee Intelsat S.A. has an audit committee consisting of Messrs. Svider, Durban and Bateman. The members are not independent since they are associated with the New Sponsors. Pursuant to its charter and the authority delegated to it by the board of directors, the audit committee has sole authority for the engagement, compensation and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, the audit committee reviews the results and scope of the audit and other services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm, and also reviews our accounting and control procedures and policies. The audit committee also is a primary monitor of risks impacting the Company, and performs the primary risk oversight role of the board of directors. The audit committee meets as often as it determines necessary but not less frequently than once every fiscal quarter. Our board of directors has determined that each member of the audit committee is an audit committee financial expert. Compensation Committee Intelsat S.A. has a compensation committee consisting of Messrs. Svider and Durban. The members are not independent since they are associated with the New Sponsors. Pursuant to its charter and the authority delegated to it by the board of directors, the compensation committee has responsibility for the approval and evaluation of all of our compensation plans, policies and programs as they affect Intelsat S.A.s chief executive officer and its other executive officers. The compensation committee meets as often as it determines necessary. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation Intelsat S.A.s compensation committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Svider and Durban, directors of Intelsat S.A. None of these individuals has been at any time an officer or employee of Intelsat S.A., other than Mr. Svider who serves as our Chairman. During 2009, Intelsat S.A. had no compensation committee interlocksmeaning that it was not the case that an executive officer of ours served as a director or member of the compensation committee of another entity and an executive officer of the other entity served as a director or member of our compensation committee. Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller and any other person performing similar functions. The Code of Ethics is posted on our website at www.intelsat.com. We intend to disclose on our website any amendments to or waivers of this Code of Ethics. Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis Introduction The Companys senior executive team includes:  David McGlade, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;  Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;  Phillip Spector, Executive Vice President, Business Development and General Counsel; 124 Table of Contents  Stephen Spengler, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Intelsat Corporation; and  Thierry Guillemin, Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer, Intelsat Corporation. During 2009, Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell, Spector, Spengler and Guillemin comprised the Named Executive Officers (the NEOs) for the Company. The Companys compensation objectives and policies, together with specific information on the compensation for each NEO, are described herein. Compensation Objectives Our executive compensation programs are designed to encourage our executives to think and act like owners of the Company. We want our executive officers to focus on generating returns for our shareholders, but at the same time to share the downside risk if their decisions cause poor performance. Through our performance management and rewards programs, we endeavor to create an environment that fosters and rewards increasing enterprise value. The Company has developed a set of strategic corporate objectives designed to support long term growth in its enterprise value. The strategic corporate objectives are set in four areas: financial, customers, internal processes and people. Through this process, the Company achieves a balanced focus on corporate performance without overemphasizing one area over the other. Additionally, the Company sets specific metrics and initiatives designed to measure performance against the strategic goals. Through our pay-for-performance culture, a significant portion of our executives compensation is linked to performance against these objectives. Our Compensation Committee reviews all of the compensation policies covering NEOs and approves all compensation for the NEOs with employment agreements, as described below. Compensation Policy We believe that in order to achieve our objectives, our executive compensation programs must be competitive, reward good results and provide incentives for future performance that sustain and enhance long-term shareholder value. Our overall executive compensation philosophy is one based upon alignment with our shareholders. The level of total compensation varies based upon the returns ultimately achieved by our shareholders. The amount of variable compensation also increases with the level of the executive officer. Our performance-driven compensation policy consists of the following three components:  base salary;  short-term incentive awards (in the form of annual cash bonuses); and  long-term incentive awards (in the form of restricted shares and options). We use short-term compensation (base salaries and annual cash bonuses) to provide competitive levels of cash compensation for our executives and to focus them on our annual goals and objectives. We use long-term compensation (restricted shares and options) to achieve our goal of driving long-term growth in share value. This long-term compensation element is designed to emphasize the performance measures our executives need to achieve in order to deliver shareholder value. Our NEOs hold a mixture of previously granted restricted shares and newly granted restricted shares and options awarded in connection with the Companys 125 Table of Contents acquisition by our New Sponsors in February of 2008 and thereafter. These newly granted equity incentive awards are subject to a variety of time and performance vesting requirements, all closely linked to the long-term growth in the value of the Company. We carefully determine the percentage mix of compensation components we think is appropriate for each of our NEOs. This is not a mechanical process and we use our judgment and experience to determine the appropriate mix of compensation for each individual. We also look at market data for comparable executive positions. The number of restricted shares and options each currently serving NEO received was based on the expectations we have for the individual and, over time, on such officers performance against those expectations. Base salary may constitute a minority portion of the total compensation of our NEOs. We set salary to provide adequate cash compensation to be competitive in the market for executive talent, but we focus on total compensation, including short-term and long-term compensation, so that our NEOs are prepared to have at risk a significant portion of their total compensation. The level and terms of compensation for Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector are set forth in the terms of employment agreements between Intelsat Global S.A. and the executive. The terms of compensation for Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin are governed by the general policies and plans of the Company and are not set forth in employment agreements, with the exception of letters regarding arrangements for severance under certain conditions. Elements of Compensation Base Salary. Base salary is used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of the executive officers in their roles. When establishing the 2009 base salaries of the NEOs, the Compensation Committee and management considered a number of factors, including the functional role of the position, the individuals performance, the level of the individuals responsibility, the individuals prior experience in similar positions, competitive market data, the ability to replace the individual, the base salary of the individual at his or her prior employment or prior position within the Company and the number of well-qualified candidates available. The salaries of the NEOs are reviewed on an annual basis, as well as at the time of promotion or other changes in responsibilities. Annual Cash Bonuses. We maintain a corporate bonus plan, which was adopted by the board of directors in March 2006 (the Bonus Plan). The Bonus Plan provides that certain of our and our subsidiaries employees, including the NEOs, may be awarded cash bonuses based on the attainment of specific performance goals and business criteria established by our board of directors for participants in the Bonus Plan. These goals and criteria for the 2009 fiscal year included certain revenue, backlog, adjusted operating expense and adjusted EBITDA targets, all as defined by the Compensation Committee. For the 2010 fiscal year, the goals and criteria include certain revenue, backlog and adjusted EBITDA targets, as defined by the Compensation Committee. Annual cash bonuses are short-term incentive awards intended to reward individual performance for the prior fiscal year and will, therefore, vary from year to year. These bonuses are determined on a discretionary basis. Our Compensation Committee, in consultation with management, establishes performance targets which determine bonus eligibility for our executives. The Compensation Committee also has discretion to award additional bonuses to our executives up to specified percentages of annual base salary. Bonus targets are determined based upon the executives level in the Company as well as by a total cash compensation market comparison. Awards for the subject year are determined based upon completion of the audited consolidated financial statements for that year. 126 Table of Contents The employment agreements for Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector specify that their annual target bonus percentages are 100%, 65% and 65%, respectively, of the executives annual base salary. These bonus amounts are paid in the event of the Companys achievement of pre-established metrics at the target level. The Compensation Committee also has discretion, in the event of significant outperformance of target objective criteria, to award additional bonuses. The Compensation Committee has established two additional levels of performance, tied to objective criteria at two tiers above the target levels, at which Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector may achieve additional bonuses. At the first tier of stretch performance, Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector may each receive an additional bonus of up to 50% of such executives annual base salary. At the second tier of stretch performance, Mr. McGlade may achieve an additional bonus of up to another 50% of his annual base salary and Messrs. McDonnell and Spector may each achieve an additional bonus of up to another 15% of such executives annual base salary. In the case of Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin, their target bonus percentages have been established pursuant to the terms of the Bonus Plan at 60% and 45%, respectively, of the executives annual base salary. In the event that the corporate performance achieves the first tier of stretch performance and based upon each executives individual performance, Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin each has the ability to obtain a maximum additional bonus in the amounts of 40.8% and 30.6%, respectively, of annual base salary. Each of the target goals and criteria for bonuses referred to above is based on thorough discussion between the Compensation Committee and management as to budgets and projections for the relevant year. Great care is taken to ensure that the targets are difficult to achieve but achievable, thereby ensuring that the NEOs and other management are appropriately incentivized to perform at the highest levels. While the Bonus Plan is a discretionary plan and the Compensation Committee retains the right to award compensation absent the attainment of performance criteria, that discretion has not been exercised as the Company has achieved its financial targets under the Bonus Plan for the past three years. Long-Term Incentive Awards Shares and Options. At the NEO level, we have sought to weight our compensation programs to ownership of common shares. We believe that share ownership by our executives enhances our ability to deliver superior shareholder returns by increasing the alignment between the interests of our employees and our shareholders. The equity awards granted to our executives are governed by the terms of the Intelsat Global, Ltd. 2008 Share Incentive Plan (the 2008 Share Plan). The goal of the 2008 Share Plan is to engage our NEOs and other key employees as partners in the Companys success and help the Company realize the maximum return from its strategy. We do not have a formal requirement for share ownership by any group of employees. The 2008 Share Plan provides for the granting of incentive share options, nonqualified share options, restricted shares, restricted share units, share appreciation rights, phantom shares and performance awards to our and our subsidiaries and specified affiliates employees, officers and directors, including the NEOs. The Compensation Committee has exclusive authority to select the persons to receive awards and the amount and the type of equity awards under the 2008 Share Plan. At the time of each award, the Compensation Committee determines the terms of the award, including the performance period (or periods) and the performance objectives relating to the award. The Companys policy has been to grant equity awards that align with the ownership objectives of our principal shareholders. Because the Company is privately held, the grant is typically a one-time grant at the outset of the shareholder investment, with vesting and other performance criteria aligned with the growth expected and the length of investment expected by the shareholders. For example, Messrs. McGlade, Spector, Spengler and Guillemin each received a 127 Table of Contents grant of shares in connection with the investment of prior sponsors in January of 2005. Upon the disposition of the prior sponsor shares, these executives received compensation commensurate with the return on investment received by the prior sponsors. See footnote 8 to the Summary Compensation Table for the amounts received by each of the executives. As described more fully below in the equity award agreements narrative, each of the NEOs received new equity grants in connection with the investment of the New Sponsors, with terms and conditions aligned with the New Sponsors investment horizon. Additional grants may also occur upon the promotion or hire of a new executive. Based upon the rights of the executive and the Company under the terms of their award agreements, some option grants are considered to be a share-based compensation arrangement (an SCA) for accounting purposes rather than an option; however, from a compensation policy perspective, the award is intended to operate like an option. For purposes of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and the tables included in this Executive Compensation item, any reference to an option includes SCAs. For further explanation of the accounting treatment of options and SCAs, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. In addition to grants made under the 2008 Share Plan, Messrs. McGlade and Spector each purchased for cash certain unrestricted shares of Intelsat Global S.A. pursuant to subscription agreements entered into in May 2009. Restricted Shares. Each of the NEOs holds restricted shares that are subject to transfer, vesting and other restrictions as set forth in their applicable award agreements. A portion of these restricted shares vests each month with full vesting being achieved over a period of five years, subject to the executives continued employment. Certain of the shares awarded are also subject to the meeting of performance criteria based on annual performance targets and cumulative total return earned by certain principal shareholders of Intelsat Global on their investment. Upon termination of employment, the Company retains the unilateral right to repurchase vested shares at fair market value as defined in the 2008 Share Plan. See the discussion of individual agreements following the Summary Compensation Table for further details regarding these restricted shares. Options. Each of the NEOs holds options that are subject to transfer, vesting and other restrictions as set forth in their applicable award agreements. A portion of these options vests upon the meeting of annual performance targets and a portion vests upon the determination of the cumulative total return earned by certain principal shareholders of Intelsat Global on their investment. These options are also subject to forfeiture and other restrictions as set forth in the executives respective award agreements. Upon termination of employment, the Company retains the right to cancel vested options or to repurchase shares acquired upon exercise of the options in exchange for an amount set forth in the 2008 Share Plan. See the discussion of individual agreements following the Summary Compensation Table for further details regarding these options. Other Elements. Other elements of our executive compensation program include certain severance arrangements and perquisites, all of which are more fully described in those parts of this Management section which follow this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Our philosophy with respect to these items is to maintain competitive overall compensation programs. The NEOs also participate in our other benefit plans on the same terms as other employees. These plans include a 401(k) plan, medical, dental, disability and life insurance. However, under the terms of their employment agreements, Messrs. McGlade and Spector are 128 Table of Contents provided with certain retiree medical benefits that are not otherwise provided to participants under the terms of the medical plan. Additionally, for employees hired prior to July 19, 2001, the Company maintains a defined benefit pension plan. Of the NEOs, only Mr. Guillemin is eligible to participate in this plan. Competitive Market Review During 2009, the Company conducted a review of our executive short-term compensation program. The objective of the review was to determine relative market competitiveness of our compensation to enable the Company to attract and to retain key executive talent. In setting compensation we target the median compensation range for base salary and above median for total cash compensation (base salary and target bonus). Using market survey data we compared our executive officers total direct compensation levels to an industry peer group of companies and other general survey data. The peer group was selected based on industry, size (determined by reviewing both revenue levels and enterprise value) and other factors such as market capitalization. Based on this review, it was determined that all elements of our executive compensation program were reasonably competitive with market rates for comparable executive officers. Role of Executive Officers in Setting Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee approves the final determination of compensation for Messrs. Spector and McDonnell, acting on recommendation of our Chief Executive Officer, David McGlade, and in consultation with the head of our human resources department. The Compensation Committee determines the compensation of Mr. McGlade acting with advice from the head of our human resources department. Mr. McGlade plays no role in determining his own compensation. The compensation for Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin is set by Mr. McGlade in consultation with the head of our human resources department. Conclusion Our compensation policies are designed to recruit, retain and motivate our senior executive officers, to align their interests with those of our shareholders, and ultimately to reward them for outstanding performance. 129 Table of Contents Summary Compensation Table The following summarizes the compensation earned during the year ended December 31, 2009 by our NEOs, who are our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and our three other most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers on December 31, 2009.

From February 16, 2009 through February 14, 2010, Mr. McGlades annual salary was $1,020,000. Effective February 15, 2010, Mr. McGlades annual salary was increased to $1,040,400. (2) Mr. McDonnell has an employment agreement that provided for an annual salary of $515,000 from his employment date on November 3, 2008 through February 15, 2009. From February 16, 2009 through February 14, 2010, Mr. McDonnells annual salary was $527,875. Effective February 15, 2010, Mr. McDonnells annual salary was increased to $538,433. (3) Mr. Spector has an employment agreement that provided for an annual salary of $515,000 from February 4, 2008 through February 15, 2009. From February 16, 2009 through February 14, 2010, Mr. Spectors annual salary was $527,875. Effective February 15, 2010, Mr. Spectors annual salary was increased to $538,433. (4) Mr. Spenglers annual salary was $335,000 from February 18, 2008 through February 15, 2009. From February 16, 2009 through February 14, 2010, Mr. Spenglers annual salary was $350,000. Effective February 15, 2010, Mr. Spenglers annual salary was increased to $357,000. (5) Mr. Guillemins annual salary was $275,000 from February 18, 2008 through February 15, 2009. From February 16, 2009 through February 14, 2010, Mr. Guillemins annual salary was $295,625. Effective February 15, 2010, Mr. Guillemins annual salary was increased to $307,450. (6) Mr. Spengler received this amount of retention bonus in connection with a retention bonus program implemented at the time of the New Sponsors Acquisition. (7) Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell, Spector, Spengler and Guillemin each received a grant of stock awards in 2009 with a combination of time vesting and performance vesting. These amounts reflect the assumption that all time and performance vesting criteria will ultimately be met and a fair value on grant date of $10.73 per share. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the shares are set forth in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (8) Messrs. McGlade, Spector, Spengler and Guillemin each received payments in 2008 as a result of the disposition of their shares as part of the New Sponsors Acquisition. These payments were with respect to restricted share awards granted in 2005. The cash payments received were $81,191,359, $35,871,919, $6,847,952 and $1,283,971, respectively. (9) Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell, Spector, Spengler and Guillemin each received an award of options in 2009, all of which become vested upon the achievement of certain annual and investment return performance standards. The table assumes that the portion of the award which vests upon achievement of financial targets in 2010 have vested; however, the table also assumes that the annual performance targets beyond 2010 and the exit investment target are not achieved, as we cannot say that such future performance is probable of outcome. However, even assuming that the highest level of performance criteria is achieved, the value at grant date was 0 based upon the intrinsic value of the option at grant date under fair value determination computed in accordance with FASB ASC 718. (10) Payments for 2009 were based on performance criteria established at the beginning of 2009 in accordance with the Bonus Plan described above. We met each of the targeted performance criteria, plus first tier and second tier stretch levels for each metric 130 Table of Contents established as part of the Bonus Plan for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of meeting these targets, performance incentive payments were made in accordance with the terms of the Bonus Plan and applicable executive employment agreements. Payments were approved by the Compensation Committee and paid in March 2010. (11) Mr. Guillemin participated in the Companys Pension Plan and Restoration Plan, as described below in the Pension Benefits section of this Management section. This amount reflects the change in the actuarial present value of his accrued benefit over the 12 month period from December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2009, using a discount rate of 5.88% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and a discount rate of 6.27% for the prior years calculation, and using an assumed retirement date of November 1, 2019 (age 60). No other NEO participates in the Pension Plan or the Restoration Plan. (12) This amount includes: (a) an auto/financial planning/club dues allowance of $20,000; (b) executive benefits paid for by the Company including tax gross up payments where applicable, in the amounts of $6,263 for life insurance, $2,124 ($774 of which was to cover taxes) for personal excess liability insurance, $2,931 ($1,397 of which was to cover taxes) for a comprehensive physical examination, and $960 for long-term disability insurance; (c) $300,000 in relocation expenses reimbursed pursuant to Mr. McGlades employment agreement; (d) $1,572,179 in payments made to cover the federal and state taxes on the income resulting from the grant of restricted shares during 2009; and (e) $26,950 in contributions to Mr. McGlades 401(k) plan account.

Assuming that the performance targets are all met, and assuming a grant date fair value of $10.73 for shares and $0 for options, the estimated future payout value for Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell, Spector, Spengler and Guillemin are the same amounts reflected in the column titled Grant Date Fair Value of Shares and Option Awards. It should be noted that Intelsat Global is privately held and there is no public market for its securities. Accordingly, we have used managements estimate of the fair value of the shares, relying in part on the most recent independent valuation performed as of the grant date. (2) These awards represent restricted shares of Class B common stock issued in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition. The fair value of the Class B shares was $10.73 on grant date. Additional details of the awards are set forth in the equity award agreements narrative below and additional details about the fair value determination are set forth in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) These awards represent options to purchase Class A common stock issued in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition. Additional details of the awards are set forth in the equity award agreements narrative below and additional details about the fair value determination are set forth in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (4) These awards represent share-based compensation arrangements issued in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition. No grant date has been established under the provisions of FASB ASC 718 and accordingly there is no fair value associated with the stock award. Additional details of the awards are set forth in the equity award agreements narrative and additional details about the fair value determination are set forth in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Employment and Other Agreements Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector each are employed with the Company pursuant to employment agreements with Intelsat Global, Ltd. and Intelsat, Ltd. On December 21, 2009, in connection with the migration of Intelsat Global and certain of our other companies to Luxembourg, these employment agreements were assigned to Intelsat Management LLC, a direct subsidiary of Intelsat S.A. and the company by which they are now employed. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. McGlade serves as Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. McDonnell serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Spector serves as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin are not party to employment agreements with the Company, however, the Company does have certain severance and other obligations to them pursuant to Company policies and each has a letter agreement covering the payment of severance benefits in the event of certain termination circumstances. Each of the NEOs is a party to agreements governing the terms of his restricted share awards and option/SCA awards. Details of the agreements in place for 2009 for each of the NEOs appear below. 132 Table of Contents Employment Agreements with Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector McGlade Employment Agreement.

The Spector Employment Agreement provides for Mr. Spectors continued employment as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of each of Intelsat Global and the Company. The Spector Employment Agreement supersedes the terms and conditions of his prior employment agreement. Compensation and Benefits. The McGlade, McDonnell and Spector Employment Agreements each has a term of one year and renews automatically for successive one year periods, unless earlier terminated. The McGlade Employment Agreement provides that Mr. McGlade will be paid an annual base salary of no less than $1,000,000 during the term, which will be reviewed for increase no less frequently than annually. The McDonnell and Spector Employment Agreements provide that Messrs. McDonnell and Spector will each be paid an annual base salary of no less than $527,875 during the term, which will be reviewed for increase no less frequently than annually. The McGlade Employment Agreement also provides that Mr. McGlade will be eligible for (i) a basic annual bonus of 100% of annual base salary, based on meeting pre-established performance criteria, and (ii) two additional annual bonuses, the stretch bonus and super stretch bonus, each of 50% of annual base salary and each based on meeting incrementally more difficult to achieve pre-established performance criteria. In exchange for Mr. McGlades waiver of any relocation reimbursement commitments set forth in his prior employment agreement, the Company paid Mr. McGlade consideration in the amount of $300,000. The McDonnell and Spector Employment Agreements also provide that Messrs. McDonnell and Spector will be eligible for (i) a basic annual bonus of 65% of annual base salary, based on meeting pre-established performance criteria, and (ii) two additional annual bonuses, the stretch bonus at 50% of base salary and the super stretch bonus at 15% of annual base salary and each based on meeting incrementally more difficult to achieve pre-established performance criteria.

The McGlade Employment Agreement and Spector Employment Agreement also provide for them to receive certain retiree medical benefits for the respective lifetimes of Mr. McGlade and Mr. Spector and their spouses under the Intelsat Group Welfare Benefits Plan. 133 Table of Contents The McGlade, McDonnell and Spector Employment Agreements also provide for the executives to receive certain perquisites as set forth therein and quantified in the Summary Compensation Table set forth above. Severance Benefits. The McGlade, McDonnell and Spector Employment Agreements also provide for certain severance benefits to be paid to the executive in the event of employment termination under certain circumstances. Specifically, if the executives employment is terminated without cause or if he resigns for good reason (in either case as defined in the McGlade, McDonnell and Spector Employment Agreements) on or after January 1, 2009, subject to his timely execution and non-revocation of a waiver and release of claims and the executives continued compliance with the terms of the employment agreement, and except as otherwise required by law or by the terms of the Companys benefit plans (excluding severance plans), the executive will be paid severance in an amount equal to a multiple of the sum of the executives (i) annual base salary plus (ii) the basic annual bonus and the stretch annual bonus (as in effect on the date of such termination of employment) (the Target Bonus), which severance amount shall be payable on the sixtieth day after such termination of employment. For purposes of calculating the severance benefit under this provision, the multiple is 1.5 for Mr. McGlade and 1.25 for Messrs. McDonnell and Spector. In addition, in connection with a termination of the executives employment without cause or for good reason, and in the event of a termination of his employment by reason of his death or disability, the executive will be paid any earned but unpaid compensation and a pro-rata Target Bonus for the year of his termination of employment based on actual results and the portion of the fiscal year the executive was employed by the Company through the effective date of such termination of employment, payable in the calendar year following such termination of employment at such time bonuses are paid to the Companys other senior executives. The McGlade, McDonnell and Spector Employment Agreements define good reason to include any of (i) a material diminution of title, position or responsibilities, (ii) a material breach by the Company of any terms of the applicable executives Employment Agreement; (iii) a reduction of the executives base salary or bonus potential, and (iv) under certain specified conditions, relocation or a requirement to work from a location other than the principal place of employment. In the event that certain specified corporate transactions occur, and the affirmative written consent of certain shareholders or a representative thereof is not required for the Company to terminate the executives employment at the time of such termination, and the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (each as defined in the applicable McGlade, McDonnell or Spector Employment Agreement), then applicable vesting provisions of the executives equity award agreements shall apply as if a change in control (as defined in the applicable McGlade, McDonnell or Spector Employment Agreement) had occurred immediately prior to such termination of employment. If the affirmative written consent of certain shareholders or a representative thereof is required for the Company to terminate the executives employment at the time of such termination following such a corporate transaction, and the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason on or after the date that is eighteen months following the date of such corporate transaction, then the applicable vesting provision of the executives equity award agreements shall apply as if a change in control had occurred immediately prior to such termination of employment. Partial Gross-Up Payment. In the event that excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), will be imposed on any compensation or benefits received by Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell or Spector, then, if (i) no shares of the Company are readily tradable on an established securities market or otherwise and (ii) the 134 Table of Contents shareholders that controlled more than 75% of the voting power of the Company entitled to vote on February 4, 2008 no longer hold 75% of such voting power at the time such excise tax would be imposed, the Company shall pay the executive an additional payment (the Partial Gross-Up Payment) equal to the amount of the excise tax that will be imposed on such compensation or benefits; provided, that such Partial Gross-Up Payment will not include any additional payments for any federal, state or local income taxes imposed on such compensation or benefits or on the Partial Gross-Up Payment, including any excise tax imposed on the Partial Gross-Up Payment. In the event that excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code will be imposed on any compensation or benefits received by Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell or Spector and the Companys shares are readily tradable on an established securities market or otherwise at such time, then the Company shall pay the executive an additional payment such that he will be placed in the same after-tax position that he would have been in had no excise tax been imposed. Non-Competition. The McGlade, McDonnell and Spector Employment Agreements each provide that, during the executives employment with the Company and for one year after termination of his employment, whether voluntary or involuntary, the executive will not compete with the Company or its affiliates or hire or attempt to hire any person who is or was, during the year prior to the termination of his employment, an employee of the Company. Employment Arrangements with Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin do not have employment agreements, but under the terms of the Companys severance plans and agreements, in the event their employment is involuntarily terminated without cause, Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin are entitled to a severance benefit equal to nine months salary and eight months salary, respectively, and executive outplacement services. The severance benefits are contingent upon the executive signing a standard release of claims and a non-compete, non-solicitation and non-disparagement agreement. Cause is defined as willful misconduct or negligence in the performance of duties. Additionally, on May 8, 2009, Intelsat Global entered into letter agreements with Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin providing for an enhanced severance benefit under certain limited circumstances (the Severance Agreements). The Severance Agreements provide that in the event the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (in either case as defined in the Severance Agreements) following certain specified corporate transactions identified in the Severance Agreements, the executive will be paid an amount equal to one times base salary as in effect on the date of termination, payable in a lump sum on the sixtieth day after such termination of employment. The Severance Agreements will supersede each executives existing severance arrangements to the extent the Severance Agreements apply with respect to an executives termination of employment. Equity Award Agreements McGlade, McDonnell and Spector Awards. On May 6, 2009, Messrs. McGlade and Spector each entered into a Class A Restricted Share Agreement, a Class B Restricted Share Agreement and an Option Agreement and Mr. McDonnell entered into a Class B Restricted Share Agreement and an Option Agreement, each with Intelsat Global. The Class A Restricted Share Agreements entered into with Messrs. McGlade and Spector govern the terms and conditions applicable to the executives outstanding restricted share awards under a previous plan that were unvested at the time of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transaction and were exchanged for restricted shares in the new corporate entity (Rollover Shares). These Rollover Shares are subject to vesting and forfeiture provisions. Subject to the 135 Table of Contents executives continued employment, the Class A Shares subject to the Class A Restricted Share Agreement vest in twenty-four equal monthly installments on the last day of each month commencing February 29, 2008. The Class A Shares subject to the Class A Restricted Share Agreement shall automatically vest immediately prior to a change in control (as defined in the 2008 Share Plan) or if the executive dies or becomes disabled, his employment is terminated without cause or if he resigns for good reason (in either case as defined in the McGlade or Spector Employment Agreement, as applicable). The Class A Restricted Share Agreement also provides that in the event of the executives termination of employment, Intelsat Global may repurchase the shares subject to the agreement generally for fair market value, unless the termination is for cause. If the executive is terminated for cause, the shares may be repurchased for the executives purchase price or the per share fair market value of the Class A Shares as of February 4, 2008. The Class A Restricted Share Agreements govern 158,810.45 Rollover Shares for Mr. McGlade and 70,165.54 Rollover Shares for Mr. Spector. The Class B Restricted Share Agreements entered into with Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector govern the terms and conditions applicable to the Class B Shares issued to each executive as of May 6, 2009. A portion of the Class B Shares subject to the Class B Restricted Share Agreement are subject to time vesting (Class B Time-Vesting Shares) and a portion of the Class B Shares are subject to annual performance-based vesting upon the achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA and revenue goals for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 (Class B Performance Shares). Mr. McGlade was awarded 319,472 Class B Shares, with 228,194 designated as Class B Time-Vesting Shares and the remaining 91,278 designated as Class B Performance Shares. Of the 228,194 Class B Time-Vesting Shares issued to Mr. McGlade, 25% were vested on the date of grant and the remaining shares vest in equal installments over 45 months from the date of grant, commencing on June 4, 2009. Mr. McDonnell was awarded 80,679 Class B Shares, with 57,628 designated as Class B Time-Vesting Shares and the remaining 23,051designated as Class B Performance Shares. Of the 57,628 Class B Time-Vesting Shares issued to Mr. McDonnell, 10% were vested on the date of grant and the remaining shares vest in equal installments over 54 months from the date of grant, commencing on June 4, 2009. Mr. Spector was awarded 80,679 Class B Shares, with 57,628 designated as Class B Time-Vesting Shares and the remaining 23,051 designated as Class B Performance Shares. Of the 57,628 Class B Time-Vesting Shares issued to Mr. Spector, 25% were vested on the date of grant and the remaining shares vest in equal installments over 45 months from the date of grant, commencing on June 4, 2009. In the event of a change in control, as defined in the 2008 Share Plan, the Class B Time-Vesting Shares become fully vested, and the Class B Performance Shares vest if certain principal shareholders receive a three times multiple on their investment (four times if the change in control occurs after February 4, 2015). In the event the executive dies or becomes disabled, the Class B Time-Vesting Shares become fully vested and the Class B Performance Shares cease vesting and unvested shares are forfeited, unless, within six months following such termination, an initial public offering occurs or Intelsat Global enters into a definitive agreement resulting in a change in control, in which case the unvested shares will be eligible to become vested as if a change in control had occurred immediately prior to termination (Transaction Vesting Protection). In the event the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (in either case as defined in the executives Employment Agreement), the Transaction Vesting Protection applies to both the Class B Time-Vesting and Class B Performance Shares, and if such termination occurs after July 31, 2010 (April 30, 2011 for Mr. McDonnell), 50% of the unvested Class B Time-Vesting Shares vest. The Class B Restricted Share Agreements for Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector provide for similar repurchase rights for Intelsat Global as are set forth in the executives Class A Restricted Share Agreement, 136 Table of Contents provided, however, that the repurchase price is generally a liquidation fair market value. In the event the executive breaches any covenants contained in the executives Employment Agreement, he will be required to repay Intelsat Global for all the Class B Shares which vested during the twelve months preceding the breach of the covenants. The Option Agreements entered into with Messrs. McGlade, McDonnell and Spector govern the terms and conditions applicable to options to purchase Class A Shares granted to each executive as of May 6, 2009. The exercise price of each option is $100 per share. Each option is subject to performance vesting. Each option will vest with respect to a portion of the Class A Shares (the Annual Performance Options) based upon the achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA and revenue goals for 2010, 2011 and 2012 (and 2013 with respect to Mr. McDonnell), as defined in the Option Agreement, subject to catch-up vesting upon achievement of targets in later years or if certain principal shareholders of Intelsat Global receive a three times multiple on their investment (four times if the change in control occurs after February 4, 2015) in connection with a change in control. Upon the occurrence of a change in control or other realization event for certain specified shareholders, the option will vest ratably with respect to the remaining Class A Shares (the Exit Performance Option) based upon a sliding scale of return on their investment from 3.3 times to 4.1 times. The option generally expires on the earliest to occur of: (i) February 4, 2018, (ii) 90 days following resignation without good reason, (iii) one year following termination without cause or for good reason or upon death or disability, or (iv) the date of termination for cause. The option is subject to Transaction Vesting Protection following a termination due to death or disability, a termination without cause, or a resignation for good reason. Additionally, in the event that the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason following certain specified corporate transactions, the option will vest as if a change in control had occurred immediately prior to termination. The Class A Shares acquired upon exercise of the options are subject to Intelsat Global repurchase rights similar to the rights specified in the executives Class A Restricted Share Agreements. In the event the executive breaches any covenants contained in the executives Employment Agreement, he will be required to repay Intelsat Global an amount equal to the number of shares acquired pursuant to the option during the twelve months preceding the breach of the covenants multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of the shares over the exercise price paid. Mr. McGlade was awarded options to purchase 251,013 Class A Shares, with 136,916 designated as Annual Performance Options and the remaining 114,097 designated as Exit Performance Options. Mr. McDonnell was awarded options to purchase 63,391 Class A Shares, with 34,577 designated as Annual Performance Options and the remaining 28,814 designated as Exit Performance Options. Mr. Spector was awarded options to purchase 63,391 Class A Shares, with 34,577 designated as Annual Performance Options and the remaining 28,814 designated as Exit Performance Options. Spengler and Guillemin Awards. On May 8, 2009, Intelsat Global entered into Class A Restricted Share Agreements, Class B Restricted Share Agreements and Option Agreements with each of Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin. The Class A Restricted Share Agreements govern the terms and conditions applicable to Rollover Shares, consisting of the Class A Shares issued to Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin as of February 4, 2008 in exchange for a previous equity award. Mr. Spenglers Class A Restricted Share Agreement covers 16,237.41 Class A Shares and Mr. Guillemins Class A Restricted Share Agreement covers 3,044.47 Class A Shares. The shares are subject to vesting and forfeiture provisions. Subject to each of their continued employment, the Class A Shares subject to the Class A Restricted Share Agreements vest in twenty-three equal monthly installments on the 137 Table of Contents first day of each month commencing on March 1, 2008. The Class A Shares subject to the Class A Restricted Share Agreement shall automatically vest immediately prior to a change in control (as defined in the 2008 Share Plan), provided that no such acceleration of vesting shall occur to the extent that it would result in payments that are not fully deductible to the Company as a result of Section 280G of the Code. If either Mr. Spengler or Mr. Guillemin dies or becomes disabled, the unvested Class A Shares subject to the Class A Restricted Share Agreement shall automatically vest. In the event that either Mr. Spengler or Mr. Guillemin is terminated without cause following certain specified corporate transactions, his respective Class A Shares will vest as if a change in control had occurred immediately prior to such termination. The Class A Restricted Share Agreements also provide that in the event of the holders termination of employment, Intelsat Global may repurchase the shares subject to the agreement generally for fair market value, unless the termination is for cause. If either Mr. Spengler or Mr. Guillemin is terminated for cause, his shares may be repurchased at a price per share equal to par value. The Class B Restricted Share Agreements govern the terms and conditions applicable to the Class B Shares issued to Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin as of May 8, 2009. Mr. Spenglers Class B Restricted Share Agreement covers 47,320 Class B Shares of which 33,800 are designated as Class B Time-Vesting Shares and the remaining 13,520 are designated as Class B Performance Shares. Mr. Guillemins Class B Restricted Share Agreement covers 30,758 Class B Shares of which 21,970 are designated as Class B Time-Vesting Shares and the remaining 8,788 are designated as Class B Performance Shares. With respect to the Class B Time-Vesting Shares issued to each of Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin, 25% of the shares vested as of the date of grant and the remaining shares vesting in equal installments over 45 months from the date of grant, commencing on June 4, 2009. In the event of a change in control, as defined in the award agreements, the Class B Time-Vesting Shares issued to Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin become fully vested, and their Class B Performance Shares vest if certain principal shareholders of Intelsat Global receive a three times multiple on their investment (four times if the change in control occurs after February 4, 2015). In the event that either Mr. Spengler or Mr. Guillemin is terminated without cause, as defined in the 2008 Share Plan, resigns for any reason, dies or becomes disabled, his Class B Time-Vesting Shares and Class B Performance Shares cease vesting and all unvested shares are forfeited. In the event that either Mr. Spengler or Mr. Guillemin is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (as defined in the Class B Restricted Share Agreement) following certain specified corporate transactions, his respective Class B Time-Vesting Shares and Class B Performance Shares will vest as if a change in control had occurred immediately prior to such termination. The Class B Restricted Share Agreements also provide that in the event of the holders termination of employment without cause or for good reason, Intelsat Global may repurchase the shares subject to the agreement generally for a liquidation fair market value, unless the termination is for cause. If the termination is for cause, the shares may be repurchased at a price per share equal to par value. The Class B Restricted Share Agreements also contain covenants generally restricting Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin from competing against Intelsat Global for a period of one year following termination. In the event of a breach of this covenant, or any other applicable covenants, the executive will be required to repay Intelsat Global for all the Class B Shares which vested during the twenty-four months preceding the breach of the covenants. The Option Agreements govern the terms and conditions applicable to options to purchase Class A Shares granted to Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin as of May 8, 2009. Mr. Spengler was awarded an option to purchase 37,180 Class A Shares, with 20,280 designated as Annual 138 Table of Contents Performance Options and the remaining 16,900 designated as Exit Performance Options. Mr. Guillemin was awarded an option to purchase 24,167 Class A Shares, with 13,182 designated as Annual Performance Options and the remaining 10,985 designated as Exit Performance Options. The exercise price of each option is $100 per share. The options are subject to performance vesting as set forth above for the other executives Annual Performance Options and Exit Performance Options. The options generally expire on the earliest to occur of: (i) February 4, 2018, (ii) 90 days following termination of employment, other than as a result of death or disability, (iii) one year following termination upon death or disability, and (iv) the date of termination for cause. In the event that either Mr. Spengler or Mr. Guillemin is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason following certain specified corporate transactions, his respective options will vest as if a change in control had occurred immediately prior to such termination. The Class A Shares acquired upon exercise of the options are subject to repurchase rights similar to the rights specified in the Class A Restricted Share Agreements. The Option Agreements contain similar covenants as the Class B Restricted Share Agreements. In the event of a breach of any of the covenants contained in the Option Agreements, or any other applicable covenants, the individual will be required to repay Intelsat Global an amount equal to the number of shares acquired pursuant to the option during the twenty-four months preceding the breach of the covenants multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of the shares over the exercise price paid. Management Shareholders Agreement. Each recipient of an equity award is, or prior to the exercise of any options, will become, a party to that certain Management Shareholders Agreement, entered into on May 6, 2009 and effective as of February 4, 2008, by and among Intelsat Global, the principal shareholders of Intelsat Global and all employees (the Management Shareholders) who hold Class A Shares or Class B Shares (the Management Shareholders Agreement). The Management Shareholders Agreement governs the terms and conditions of a Management Shareholders ownership of Class A Shares and Class B Shares and applies to each Management Shareholder and any person or entity to whom the Management Shareholders shares are transferred (whether voluntarily or involuntarily). In general, the Management Shareholders Agreement prevents Management Shareholders from transferring any Class A Shares or Class B Shares without the consent of the Board of Directors of Intelsat Global. If the Board approves any such transfer, certain shareholders have a right of first offer to purchase the shares proposed to be transferred. Notwithstanding the general prohibition on transferring shares, Management Shareholders may be permitted to transfer shares pursuant to tag along and drag along rights set forth in the Management Shareholders Agreement. In addition, the Management Shareholders Agreement permits certain principal shareholders to repurchase Class A Shares and/or Class B shares from a Management Shareholder following the Management Shareholders termination of employment if Intelsat Global does not repurchase such shares pursuant to the applicable award agreement. The Management Shareholders Agreement also provides priority subscription rights. If certain principal shareholders purchase additional shares, the priority subscription rights allow Management Shareholders to purchase additional shares on the same terms as the sponsor shareholders. The Management Shareholders Agreement terminates upon an initial public offering (generally defined as a public offering of at least 20% of outstanding shares of Intelsat Global), the liquidation of Intelsat Global or sale of all or substantially all of Intelsat Globals assets, or a date established by the Board to terminate the Management Shareholders Agreement. In addition, the Management Shareholders Agreement may terminate at specified times following Intelsat Globals merger with a public company. 139 Table of Contents Each of Messrs. McGlade, Spector, and McDonnell have entered into letter agreements (the MSA Letter Agreements) amending the Management Shareholders Agreement as it applies to the shares held by such executives. The MSA Letter Agreements generally provide for piggy back registration rights, additional option grants upon certain conversions of Class B Shares, and limits on Intelsat Globals ability to repurchase co-invest Class A Shares purchased by certain of the executives pursuant to subscription agreements if the fair market value is less than the original purchase price per share for such shares.

(2) These awards are for Class A Shares of Intelsat Global. Because Intelsat Global is privately held, there is no public market for these securities. The market value provided here was based upon managements estimate of fair value, relying in part on the most recent independent valuation performed, dated as of December 31, 2009, which set forth a Class A Share value of $122.06 per share. These are Rollover Shares which vest for Messrs. McGlade and Spector as of January 31, 2010 and for Messrs. Spengler and Guillemin as of January 1, 2010. (3) This award is for Class B Shares of Intelsat Global. The market value reflected here is based upon managements estimate of fair value, relying in part on the most recent independent 140 Table of Contents valuation performed, dated as of December 31, 2009, which set forth a Class B Share value of $44.44 per share. The vesting date for the Class B Time-Vesting Shares is monthly, with full vesting occurring for Messrs. McGlade, Spector, Spengler and Guillemin on February 4, 2013 and for Mr. McDonnell on November 4, 2013. The vesting date for the Performance Shares was determined as of March 3, 2010, and the performance targets as described more fully in the narrative under equity award agreements were met. Option Exercises and Stock Vested The following table sets forth certain information regarding the number of restricted shares and options that vested in 2009, together with the corresponding amounts realized by the NEOs.

(2) Because Intelsat Global is privately held, there is no public market for these securities. The value realized on vesting provided here is based upon managements estimate of the fair value, relying in part on the most recent independent valuation performed, dated as of December 31, 2009. This reflects a grant of Class A Shares and the realized value is based on a Class A Share value of $122.06 per share. (3) This award is for Class B Shares. The value realized on vesting provided here is based on managements estimate of the fair value, relying in part on the most recent independent valuation performed, dated as of December 31, 2009, which set forth a Class B Share value of $44.44 per share. 141 Table of Contents Pension Benefits The following table sets forth the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits for Mr. Guillemin, the only one of our NEOs who is eligible to participate in the pension plan of the Company. Name Plan Name Number of Years of Credited Service Present Value of Accumulated Benefit Payments During the Last Fiscal Year Thierry Guillemin Intelsat Staff Retirement Plan 10.1667 $ 226,106  Intelsat Restoration Plan 9.9167 $ 16,329  Total $ 242,435 The Intelsat Staff Retirement Plan is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan covering U.S.-based employees of Intelsat who were hired prior to July 19, 2001. The benefits under the plan are calculated based upon a set of formulas that take into account the participants hire date, years of service and average compensation. For Mr. Guillemin, the formula is 2.0% of final average earnings for each year of service prior to 2002, plus 1.5% of final average earnings for each year of service on or after 2002. Final average earnings for Mr. Guillemin includes regular earnings and does not include bonus payments, and is based on average earnings over the 60 months of employment that produces the highest average. Early retirement is available at age 55 with three years of service, and there is a seven year vesting schedule. The portion of Mr. Guillemins benefit attributable to pre-2002 service is payable on an unreduced basis at age 60. Benefit payments may be taken in the form of a single life annuity, a partially subsidized 60% or 75% joint and survivor annuity if married at the time of benefit commencement, a 50% or 100% joint and survivor annuity if unmarried at the time of benefit commencement, a lump sum or a reduced annuity plus a partial lump sum. Benefits paid in the form of an annuity are adjusted for cost of living increases but only on the portion of the benefit attributable to pre-2002 service and pre-2006 compensation. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on the assumptions used to value pension benefits. As a tax-qualified plan, benefits under the Intelsat Staff Retirement Plan are subject to certain Code limitations on benefits and compensation. The Intelsat Restoration Plan is a non-qualified retirement plan that is intended to make participants whole if their benefit under the Intelsat Staff Retirement Plan is diminished due to limits on annual benefits under Section 415 of the Code or limits on includable compensation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. Effective on September 30, 2009, the Intelsat Restoration Plan was frozen and there are no benefit accruals under that plan after that date. Based on this freezing of accruals under the Intelsat Restoration Plan, the number of years of credited service reflected in the table for Mr. Guillemin is less than his actual years of service and reflects service through September 30, 2009. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation No deferred compensation programs are maintained for the Companys NEOs. Severance and Change of Control Arrangements Upon termination of employment, the NEOs may receive payments under their employment agreements or Company policies, as applicable, which are described in detail in the section entitled Employment and Other Agreements. 142 Table of Contents Benefits and Payments Upon Termination The following is a table which shows, hypothetically, what each of the current NEOs would receive upon termination of employment under varying circumstances, assuming such termination occurred on December 31, 2009 and assuming that Intelsat Global repurchased equity at an assumed fair market value. However, this table does not take into account all of the restrictions and other provisions of relevant employment contracts described earlier. Thus, this table does not represent guarantees to any NEO that he will receive the amounts set forth herein.

(2) It is currently the policy under our Bonus Plan that no bonus payments are made to plan participants who leave prior to the bonus payment date in March, unless otherwise provided for in an applicable employment agreement. (3) Under the applicable executives Employment Agreement, he is entitled to a pro-rata bonus at the tier 1 stretch level for the year of termination based on actual results and the portion of the year he was employed. This amount assumes the maximum amount payable for a full year of employment and corporate results achieved at the tier 1 stretch level. 143 Table of Contents (4) Severance payment equal to 1.5 times the sum of base salary plus bonus calculated at the tier 1 stretch level (150% of base salary), payable in a lump sum on the 60 th day following termination. (5) Rollover Shares that are vested may be repurchased at any time during the two years following a resignation that occurs through July 31, 2010 at a price per share equal to the lesser of the fair market value of such share on (i) the date of resignation or (ii) February 4, 2008 ($100). For resignations that occur after July 31, 2010, the repurchase price is based on the fair market value of the share on the date of resignation. Management estimates, relying in part on the most recent independent valuation performed, that the fair market value of the Class A Shares as of December 31, 2009 was $122.06. Accordingly, the value assumes a repurchase by Intelsat Global of vested Rollover Shares for $100.00 per share. Class B shares that are vested may be repurchased at any time during the two years following a resignation that occurs through July 31, 2010 (April 30, 2011 for Mr. McDonnell) at a price per share equal to the lesser of the Class B repurchase price defined in the 2008 Share Plan (liquidation value) on (i) the date of resignation or (ii) May 6, 2009. For resignations that occur after July 31, 2010, the repurchase price is based on the Class B repurchase price on the date of resignation. Accordingly, because the Class B repurchase price at grant date was $0, no value has been given to any vested Class B shares, other than par value at $0.01 per share. (6) Rollover Shares that are unvested at the time of termination immediately vest upon termination. Vested Rollover Shares may be repurchased at any time during the two years following the termination at a price per share equal to the fair market value of the share on the date of termination. Based upon managements estimate of the fair value, relying in part on the most recent independent valuation performed, the fair market value of the Class A Shares as of December 31, 2009 was $122.06 per share. Accordingly, the value assumes all unvested Rollover Shares vest and are repurchased by Intelsat Global at $122.06 per share. The equity award agreements for Messrs. McGlade and Spector also provide that in the event of a change of control or initial public offering within six months of the termination of employment where the share value exceeds $122.06, the executive is entitled to an additional payment equal to the number of vested shares times the excess of the higher share value over $122.06. Class B Shares that are vested may be repurchased at any time during the two-year period following termination at a price per share equal to Class B repurchase price defined in the 2008 Share Plan (liquidation value) on the date of termination. For purposes of this value, the Class B repurchase price was assumed to be $22.06 per share. (7) All Rollover Shares that are unvested immediately vest upon a change in control. Rollover Shares may be repurchased at any time during the two years following the termination at a price per share equal to the fair market value on the date of termination. This value is based on the Class A Share value of $122.06 per share. All unvested Class B Time-Vesting Shares immediately vest upon a change of control. Class B Performance Shares vest if performance criteria are met within six months from the date of the change in control. The value shown reflects 100% vesting on all Class B Time-Vesting and Performance Shares and assumes that the shares are repurchased at a Class B repurchase price of $22.06 per share. (8) All unvested Rollover Shares and Class B Time-Vesting Shares become immediately vested upon the termination of the executives employment due to death or disability. This value reflects a repurchase of Rollover Shares at $122.06 per share and a repurchase of vested Class B Shares at a Class B repurchase price of $22.06. (9) Any unvested shares are forfeited upon termination of employment, but must be repurchased at the par value of the shares ($0.01) and returned to the corporate treasury. (10) The McGlade and Spector Employment Agreements provide for Messrs. McGlade and Spector to receive retiree medical benefits for the executive and his spouse upon termination of employment. This represents the present value of Intelsats net premium cost, assuming a trend rate of 5% increases each year, immediate retirement on December 31, 2009, that each executive and each spouse live to age 80 and a discount rate of 6.3%. (11) Severance payment equal to 1.25 times the sum of base salary plus bonus calculated at the tier 1 stretch level (115% of base salary), payable in a lump sum on the 60 th day following termination. (12) It is currently the policy under our Bonus Plan to provide a pro-rata bonus, based upon actual financial performance, pro-rated for the date of death or disability, for employees who die or become disabled during the fiscal year. This number assumes a date of death or disability on December 31, 2009, corporate performance at the stretch level and individual performance rated at the same level as the prior year. (13) Payment is equal to nine months base salary payable in a lump sum at termination. (14) Rollover Shares that are vested may be repurchased at any time following a resignation at a price per share equal to the lesser of the fair market value of such share on (i) the date of resignation or (ii) February 4, 2008 ($100). The assumed fair market value of the Class A Shares as of December 31, 2009 was $122.06. Accordingly, the value assumes a repurchase by the Company of vested Rollover Shares for $100.00 per share. Class B Time-Vesting Shares that are vested may be repurchased at any time following termination at a price per share equal to the lesser of the Class B repurchase price defined in the 2008 Share Plan (liquidation value) on (i) the date of resignation or (ii) May 8, 2009. Accordingly, because the Class B repurchase price at grant date was $0, no value has been given to any vested Class B shares, other than par value at $0.01 per share. (15) Rollover Shares that are vested at the time of termination may be repurchased at any time following the termination at a price per share equal to the fair market value of the share on the date of termination. The assumed fair market value of the Class A Shares as of December 31, 2009 was $122.06. Accordingly, the value assumes all unvested Rollover Shares vest and are repurchased by the Company at $122.06 per share. Class B Shares that are vested may be repurchased at any time during the two-year period following termination at a price per share equal to Class B 144 Table of Contents repurchase price defined in the 2008 Share Plan (liquidation value) on the date of termination. For purposes of this value, the Class B repurchase price was assumed to be $22.06 per share. (16) All Rollover Shares that are unvested immediately vest upon a change in control. Rollover Shares may be repurchased at any time following the termination at a price per share equal to the fair market value on the date of termination. This value is based on the Class A Share value of $122.06 per share. All unvested Class B Time Vesting Shares immediately vest upon a change of control. The value shown reflects 100% vesting on all Class B Time-Vesting and 50% vesting on Class B Performance Shares and assumes that the shares are repurchased at a Class B repurchase price of $22.06 per share. (17) All unvested Rollover Shares become immediately vested upon the termination of the executives employment due to death or disability. This value reflects a repurchase of Rollover Shares at $122.06 per share and a repurchase of vested Class B Shares at a Class B repurchase price of $22.06 per share. (18) Payment is equal to eight months base salary payable in a lump sum at termination. Director Compensation We do not compensate our directors for their service on the board of directors or any committee of the board of directors. Non-executive members of the board are reimbursed for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses related to their board service pursuant to a monitoring fee agreement entered into with certain principal shareholders on February 4, 2008. For more information regarding the monitoring fee agreements, see Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsCertain Related Party TransactionsMonitoring Fee Agreements and Transaction Fees. Mr. Raymond Svider, a Managing Partner of BC Partners, Intelsats majority shareholder, is currently and has been since May 1, 2008, the Chairman of our Board of Directors. 145 Table of Contents CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Certain Related Party Transactions Monitoring Fee Agreements and Transaction Fees In connection with the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat Bermuda entered into a monitoring fee agreement (the 2008 MFA) with the New Sponsors, or affiliates of, or entities advised by, designated by or associated with the New Sponsors, as the case may be (collectively, the 2008 MFA parties), pursuant to which the 2008 MFA parties provide certain monitoring, advisory and consulting services to Intelsat Bermuda. Pursuant to the 2008 MFA, an annual fee equal to the greater of $6.25 million and 1.25% of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Bridge Loan Credit Agreement) is paid to the 2008 MFA parties, and Intelsat Bermuda reimburses the 2008 MFA parties for their out-of-pocket expenses. Intelsat Bermuda also agreed to indemnify the 2008 MFA parties and their directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives for losses relating to the services contemplated by the 2008 MFA and the engagement of the 2008 MFA parties pursuant to, and the performance by them of the services contemplated by, the 2008 MFA. We recorded expense for services associated with the 2008 MFA of $8.5 million and $23.2 million during the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. As payment for certain structuring and advisory services rendered, Intelsat Bermuda paid an aggregate transaction and advisory fee of $60.0 million to the 2008 MFA parties at the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions. 2008 Share Plan, Employment Agreements and Award Agreements On May 6, 2009, the Board of Directors of Intelsat Global adopted the 2008 Share Plan, under which certain employees and directors are eligible to be granted awards.

WildBlue Option Agreement On August 17, 2009 we entered into an agreement with WildBlue, in which we had an ownership interest of approximately 28% prior to December 15, 2009, granting WildBlue the exclusive option to acquire certain of our rights to operate a Ka-band satellite system at a designated orbital location for $0.2 million. This amount is included in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 in our consolidated statement of operations. On December 15, 2009 we sold our ownership interest in WildBlue to Viasat Inc. in exchange for newly issued shares of Viasat Inc. common stock. A gain on the sale was recorded within our consolidated statement of operations for $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 146 Table of Contents Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions We review all relationships and transactions in which we and our directors, executive officers or any beneficial owner of greater than 5% of our common shares or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. Our legal staff is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of processes and controls to obtain information from our directors and executive officers with respect to related person transactions and for then determining, based on the facts and circumstances, whether we or a related person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. As required under SEC rules, transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to us or a related person are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our audit committee charter also provides for the review of related party transactions by our audit committee. In addition, we and our board of directors follow the requirements set forth in the transactions with affiliates covenant contained in our indentures and credit agreement. In summary, these agreements provide that we will not, and we will not permit any of our restricted subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or series of transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with or for the benefit of, any affiliate (as defined in the agreements) involving aggregate consideration in excess of specified thresholds, unless we determine that the terms of such transaction are not materially less favorable to such company than those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction by such company with an unrelated person and that the terms of such transaction are substantially as favorable to such company as it would obtain in a comparable arms-length transaction with a person that is not an affiliate, subject to certain exceptions specified in such agreements. Copies of our indentures and credit agreement are on file with the SEC as exhibits to our periodic filings. 147 Table of Contents PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS Intelsat S.A. is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Intelsat Global.

The senior secured credit facilities consist of:  a $344.8 million senior secured term loan facility with a seven-year maturity; and  a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a six-year maturity. Revolving loans under the revolving credit facility will be available so long as the aggregate amount to be incurred, together with other loans outstanding under the term loan facility and certain other debt, does not exceed an amount that is $1,000 less than 15% of our consolidated net tangible assets. The revolving credit facility is available on a revolving basis and terminates on July 3, 2012. Up to $200.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans. Both the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any swing line loans will reduce availability under the revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, Intelsat Sub Holdco amended its senior secured credit facilities. The amendment became effective on February 4, 2008 upon the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition and amended and modified the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement to, among other things: (a) change the applicable margin on the ABR loans under the Tranche B Term Loan, Revolving Credit Loan and Swingline Loan facilties to a rate of 1.50% per annum and change the applicable margin on LIBOR loans under the Tranche B Term Loan, Revolving Credit Loan and Swingline Loan facilities to a rate of 2.50% per annum; (b) reduce the size of the revolving credit facility by $50.0 million and add a $50.0 million incremental revolving credit facility provision; (c) add language requiring the payment of a prepayment premium for prepayments of the Tranche B Term Loan prior to February 4, 2010 (subject to certain exceptions); (d) make certain changes permitting the New Sponsors Acquisition; (e) add a financial maintenance covenant requiring compliance with a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio of less than or equal to 1.5 to 1.0; and (f) appoint Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch as successor administrative agent. The obligations under Intelsat Sub Holdcos senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by Intermediate Holdco and certain of Intelsat Sub Holdcos subsidiaries. The obligations under the senior secured credit facilities are secured by a perfected first priority security interest to the extent legally permissible in substantially all of Intelsat Sub Holdcos and the guarantors tangible and intangible assets, with certain exceptions. Prepayments Borrowings under the Tranche B Term Loan are subject to a prepayment premium in the event that the term loans are prepaid prior to February 4, 2010 (subject to certain exceptions). 151 Table of Contents Covenants The senior secured credit facilities contain customary representations, warranties and covenants for a borrower such as Intelsat Sub Holdco, including limitations on Intelsat Sub Holdcos or its subsidiaries ability to:  incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock, subject to certain exceptions;  pay dividends, or make redemptions and repurchases, with respect to ordinary shares or capital stock;  create or incur certain liens;  make certain loans or investments;  make acquisitions or investments, engage in mergers, acquisitions, amalgamations, asset sales and sale lease-back transactions; and  engage in transactions with affiliates.

Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding obligations under the revolving credit facility have the ability to amend, modify or waive a default under the senior secured net debt leverage ratio covenant.

Optional Redemption of Senior Election Notes Upon Equity Offering .

Notice of any redemption of senior election notes may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering. The Issuer, its Subsidiaries or any Parent of the Issuer may at any time and from time to time purchase senior election notes in the open market or otherwise. The Issuer may also redeem the notes under the circumstances described below under Redemption for Taxation Reasons. Payment of Additional Amounts If the Issuer (or any Guarantor) is required by law to deduct or withhold taxes imposed by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on payments to holders, it will pay additional amounts on those payments to the extent described in this section.  Relevant Tax Jurisdiction  means Bermuda, or another jurisdiction (such as Luxembourg) in which the Issuer or a Guarantor, if any, or a successor of any of them, is organized, is resident or engaged in business for tax purposes or through which payments are made on or in connection with the notes. The Issuer (or any Guarantor) will pay to any holder so entitled all additional amounts that may be necessary so that every net payment of interest, principal, premium or other amount on that note will not be less than the amount provided for in that note.  Net payment  refers to the amount the Issuer or any paying agent pays the holder after deducting or withholding an amount for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed with respect to that payment by a taxing authority (including any withholding or deduction attributable to additional amounts payable hereunder). 169 Table of Contents The Issuer (and any Guarantor) will also indemnify and reimburse holders for  taxes (including any interest, penalties and related expenses) imposed on the holders by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction if and to the same extent that a holder would have been entitled to receive additional amounts if the Issuer (or any Guarantor) had been required to deduct or withhold those taxes from payments on the notes; and  stamp, court, documentary or similar taxes or charges (including any interest, penalties and related expenses) imposed by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in connection with the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of the notes or other related documents and obligations. This obligation to pay additional amounts is subject to several important exceptions, however. The Issuer (or any Guarantor) will not pay additional amounts to any holder for or on account of any of the following:  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because at any time there is or was a connection between the holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of or possessor of power over the relevant holder if the holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation) and the jurisdiction imposing the tax (other than the mere receipt of a payment or the acquisition, ownership, disposition or holding of, or enforcement of rights under, a note);  any estate, inheritance, gift or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because the holder (or if the holder is not the beneficial owner, the beneficial owner) that is legally able to do so fails to comply with any certification, identification or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the taxing jurisdiction of the holder or any beneficial owner of the note, if compliance is required by law or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the jurisdiction imposing the tax is a party, as a precondition to exemption from the tax, assessment or other governmental charge and the Issuer has given the holders at least 60 days notice that holders will be required to provide such information and identification;  any tax, assessment or other governmental charge with respect to a note presented for payment more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for and notice thereof given to holders, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that the holder of the note would have been entitled to additional amounts on presenting the note for payment on any date during the 30-day period; and  any withholding or deduction imposed on a payment to an individual that is required to be made pursuant to the European Union Directive on the taxation of savings income, which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council on June 3, 2003, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive. Redemption for Taxation Reasons The Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem any series of the notes in whole if at any time it becomes obligated to pay additional amounts on any notes on the next interest payment date with respect to such series of notes, but only if its obligation results from a change in, or an amendment to, the laws or treaties (including any regulations or 170 Table of Contents rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or from a change in any official position regarding the interpretation, administration or application of those laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a change resulting from a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction), that becomes effective or is announced after the Issue Date and provided the Issuer cannot avoid the obligation after taking reasonable measures to do so. If the Issuer redeems the notes in these circumstances, it will do so at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, and any other amounts due to the redemption date. If the Issuer becomes entitled to redeem the notes in these circumstances, it may do so at any time on a redemption date of its choice. However, the Issuer must give the holders of the notes being redeemed notice of the redemption not less than 30 days or more than 60 days before the redemption date and not more than 90 days before the next date on which it would be obligated to pay additional amounts. In addition, the Issuers obligation to pay additional amounts must remain in effect when it gives the notice of redemption. Notice of the Issuers intent to redeem the notes shall not be effective until such time as it delivers to the Trustee both a certificate signed by two of its officers stating that the obligation to pay additional amounts cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures and an opinion of independent legal counsel or an independent auditor stating that the Issuer is obligated to pay additional amounts because of an amendment to or change in law, treaties or position as described in the preceding paragraph. Selection In the case of any partial redemption of a series of notes, selection of the senior cash-pay notes or senior election notes, as applicable, for redemption will be made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such notes are listed, or if such notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements); provided that no notes of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on notes or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Issuer has deposited with the paying agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest (if any) on, the notes to be redeemed. Any redemption and notice thereof may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. Ranking The Indebtedness evidenced by the notes is unsecured senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and is senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer. The notes are effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Secured Indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any Indebtedness and other liabilities of any Subsidiaries of the Issuer. On the Issue Date and as of the date hereof, no Subsidiaries of the Issuer guaranteed the notes. At December 31, 2009 (1) the Issuer and its Subsidiaries had approximately $14.8 billion aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (including the notes) ranking pari passu with the 171 Table of Contents notes outstanding on a consolidated basis, approximately $2.4 billion of which was Secured Indebtedness (including capital leases but excluding unused commitments); (2) the Issuer did not have any Subordinated Indebtedness outstanding; and (3) the Issuers Subsidiaries had approximately $9.8 billion of Indebtedness outstanding all of which was effectively senior to the notes. Intelsat, Ltd. had approximately $15.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness on a consolidated basis, approximately $2.4 billion of which was secured debt. Although the indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness which the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may Incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, in any case, such Indebtedness may be Secured Indebtedness. See Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock and Certain CovenantsLiens. Substantially all of the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Unless one or more Subsidiaries will be Guarantors, claims of creditors of Subsidiaries of the Issuer, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including holders of the notes. The notes, therefore, will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not be Guarantors. Although the indenture limits the Incurrence of Indebtedness by and the issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of certain of the Issuers Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications. See Risk Factors. Guarantees On the Issue Date and as of the date hereof, no Subsidiaries of the Issuer guaranteed the notes. In certain circumstances after the Issue Date, Subsidiaries of the Issuer may be required to guarantee the notes. See Certain CovenantsFuture Guarantors. Any Parent of the Issuer may guarantee the notes on or after the Issue Date, but no value should be assigned to such guarantee, such guarantor will not be subject to the covenants of the indenture and such guarantee may be released at any time. The notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings, but Holdings is not subject to the covenants in the indenture and you should not assign any value to such guarantee. Change of Control Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each, a  Change of Control ), each holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such holders notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to the extent the Issuer has previously elected to redeem notes as described under Optional Redemption: (1) the sale, lease or transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to a Person other than any of the Permitted Holders, and other than any transaction in compliance with the covenant described under Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets where the Successor Company is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of a Parent of the Issuer; or 172 Table of Contents (2) the Issuer becomes aware (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) of the acquisition by any Person or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, or any successor provision), including any group acting for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), other than any of the Permitted Holders, in a single transaction or in a related series of transactions, by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation or other business combination or purchase of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, or any successor provision), of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer or any Parent of the Issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of (i) the Transactions (and any related change in the composition of the Board of Directors of Holdings in connection therewith), (ii) any Specified Merger/Transfer Transaction, as described under Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets, or (iii) any Subsidiary Transfer Transaction, shall constitute a Change of Control. Within 90 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the notes as described under Optional Redemption, the Issuer shall mail a notice (a  Change of Control Offer ) to each holder with a copy to the Trustee stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase such holders notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of Control; (3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and (4) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow in order to have its notes purchased. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this paragraph by virtue thereof. 173 Table of Contents This Change of Control repurchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the capital structure or credit ratings of the Issuer or any of its affiliates. The Credit Agreements, the New Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreement, the indentures governing our existing and future notes, and other existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries contain or may contain prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such indebtedness to be repaid or purchased upon a Change of Control. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required purchases. The Credit Agreements, the New Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreement and other existing and future Indebtedness do not or may not permit the Issuers Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to the Issuer for the purpose of purchasing notes in the event of a Change of Control. Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of certain of the Issuers Indebtedness and other future Indebtedness could prohibit the prepayment of notes prior to their scheduled maturity. Consequently, if the Issuer is not able to prepay such Indebtedness, it will be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations if holders of notes exercise their repurchase rights following a Change of Control. The failure to make or consummate the Change of Control Offer or pay the purchase price when due will give the Trustee and the holders the rights described under Defaults. In the event that the Issuer is required to purchase outstanding notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer expects to seek third-party financing to the extent it lacks available funds to meet its purchase obligations. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase such notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. Certain Covenants The indenture contains provisions in respect of certain covenants including, among others, those summarized below: Suspension of Covenants . During any period of time that: (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a  Covenant Suspension Event ), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following provisions of the indenture: (1) Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; (2) Limitation on Restricted Payments; (3) Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries; 174 Table of Contents (4) Asset Sales; (5) Transactions with Affiliates; (6) clause (4) of the first paragraph of Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets; (7) Future Guarantors; and (8) Maintenance of Insurance (collectively, the  Suspended Covenants ). Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, any Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, will also be suspended as of such date (the  Suspension Date ). In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the  Reversion Date ) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events and the Guarantees, if any, of any Subsidiary Guarantors will be reinstated if such guarantees are then required by the terms of the indenture. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the  Suspension Period . Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on events that occurred during the Suspension Period). On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified as having been Incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph of Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock below or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock below (to the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock would be permitted to be Incurred or issued thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred or issued prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock would not be so permitted to be Incurred or issued pursuant to the first or second paragraph of Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock, such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of the second paragraph of Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under Limitation on Restricted Payments will be made as though the covenant described under Limitation on Restricted Payments had been in effect since the Issue Date (with amounts calculated from the respective dates specified in that covenant and the related definitions) and throughout the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of Limitation on Restricted Payments. As described above, however, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. 175 Table of Contents Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock . The indenture provides that: (1) the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock; and (2) the Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of Preferred Stock; provided , however , that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case if the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio of the Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would be less than or equal to 8.00 to 1.00 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been Incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period. The foregoing limitations will not apply to (collectively,  Permitted Debt ): (a) the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit Agreements and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers acceptances thereunder (with letters of credit and bankers acceptances being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the face amount thereof) up to an aggregate principal amount of $4,000.0 million outstanding at any one time; (b) the Incurrence by the Issuer (and, if applicable, any Guarantors) of Indebtedness represented by the notes (including the payment of PIK Interest through an increase in the principal amount of senior election notes and/or the issuance of PIK Notes, but not including any additional notes) (and the Guarantees, as applicable) and any exchange notes (and exchange guarantees thereof); (c) Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the Issue Date, including any Indebtedness Incurred on the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (a) and (b)) and under any Backstop Credit Facility; (d) Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations) Incurred by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, Disqualified Stock issued by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and Preferred Stock issued by any Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer to finance (whether prior to or within 270 days after) the purchase, lease, construction or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment (whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets) in an aggregate principal amount which, when aggregated with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock then outstanding that was Incurred pursuant to this clause (d), does not exceed the greater of (x) $450.0 million and (y) 4% of Total Assets of the Issuer at the time of Incurrence; (e) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries constituting reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit and bank guarantees issued in the ordinary course of business, including without limitation letters of credit in respect of workers compensation claims, health, disability or other benefits to employees or former employees or their families or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance, or other Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement type obligations regarding workers compensation claims; 176 Table of Contents (f) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnification, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in each case, Incurred in connection with the Transactions or the disposition of any business, assets or a Subsidiary of the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the indenture, other than guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business, assets or Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition; (g) Indebtedness of the Issuer to a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that any such Indebtedness is subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of the Issuer under the notes; provided , further , that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to be an Incurrence of such Indebtedness; (h) shares of Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary issued to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary; provided that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event that results in any Restricted Subsidiary that holds such shares of Preferred Stock of another Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such shares of Preferred Stock (except to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to be an issuance of shares of Preferred Stock; (i) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary; provided , that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in any Restricted Subsidiary holding such Indebtedness ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to be an Incurrence of such Indebtedness; (j) Hedging Obligations (other than for speculative purposes): (1) for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk with respect to any Indebtedness that is permitted by the terms of the indenture to be outstanding or (2) for the purpose of fixing or hedging currency exchange rate risk with respect to any currency exchanges;

provided that either (A) the provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction contained in such agreements or instruments are no less favorable to the Issuer, taken as a whole, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith, than the provisions contained in any Credit Agreement and the other Senior Credit Documents, any Backstop Credit Facility, the Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreement, the New Intelsat Jackson Unsecured Credit Agreement, the Intelsat Bermuda Loan or in an indenture or agreement governing the Existing Holdings Notes, the Existing Subsidiary Notes or the original notes, in each case, as in effect or entered into on the Issue Date or entered into in connection with the refinancing of existing indebtedness of Intelsat Jackson or (B) such encumbrances and restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument will not materially affect the Issuers ability to make anticipated principal or interest payments on the notes (as determined by the Issuer in good faith);

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on ordinary shares shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination of loans or advances made to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances. 187 Table of Contents Asset Sales .

Within 485 days after the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuers receipt of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale (or Event of Loss Proceeds), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (together with any Event of Loss Proceeds), at its option: (1) to permanently reduce Obligations under Secured Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness ( provided that if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall so reduce Obligations under Pari Passu Indebtedness (other than Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Secured Indebtedness and other than Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Indebtedness represented by the Issuers guarantee of Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), the Issuer will equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the notes if the notes are then prepayable or, if the notes may not then be prepaid, by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, the pro rata principal amount of notes that would otherwise be prepaid) or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer; provided that if an offer to purchase any Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries is made in accordance with the terms of such Indebtedness, the obligation to permanently reduce Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, will be deemed to be satisfied to the extent of the amount of the offer, whether or not accepted by the holders thereof, and no Net Proceeds in the amount of such offer will be deemed to exist following such offer, (2) to make an investment in any one or more businesses ( provided that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such acquisition 188 Table of Contents results in such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), or capital expenditures or assets, in each case used or useful in a Similar Business, and/or (3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses ( provided that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such acquisition results in such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), properties or assets that replace the properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale or Event of Loss; provided that in the case of clauses (2) and (3) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment and, in the event such binding commitment is later canceled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are so applied, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another binding commitment within nine months of such cancellation or termination of the prior binding commitment. Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds (or Event of Loss Proceeds), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds (or Event of Loss Proceeds) in Cash Equivalents or Investment Grade Securities. The indenture provides that any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale (or Event of Loss Proceeds) that are not applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds (or Event of Loss Proceeds) used to make an offer to purchase notes, as described in clause (1) above, shall be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute  Excess Proceeds . When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $55.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all holders of notes (and, at the option of the Issuer, to holders of any Pari Passu Indebtedness) (an  Asset Sale Offer ) to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes (and such Pari Passu Indebtedness) that is an integral multiple of $1,000, provided that no notes of $2,000 or less shall be purchased in part, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event such Pari Passu Indebtedness was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any (or, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $55.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate amount of notes (and such Pari Passu Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of notes surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the notes (and such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the indenture by virtue thereof. If more notes (and such Pari Passu Indebtedness) are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuer is required to purchase, the principal amount of the notes (and Pari Passu 189 Table of Contents Indebtedness) to be purchased will be determined pro rata based on the principal amount so tendered and the selection of the actual notes of each series for purchase will be made by the Trustee on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable; provided , however , that no notes (or Pari Passu Indebtedness) of $2,000 or less shall be purchased in part. Notice of an Asset Sale Offer shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of notes at such holders registered address. If any note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that relates to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased. A new note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any note purchased in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. On and after the purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on notes or portions thereof purchased. Transactions with Affiliates . The indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or series of transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an  Affiliate Transaction ) involving aggregate consideration in excess of $15.0 million, unless: (a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and (b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $35.0 million, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a resolution adopted in good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any Parent of the Issuer approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officers Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above.

(7) payments or loans (or cancellation of loans) to employees or consultants that are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith; (8) any agreement as in effect as of the Issue Date and any amendment thereto (so long as any such agreement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the holders of the notes in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date) or any transaction contemplated thereby; (9) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms of, the Acquisition Documents and any amendment thereto or similar agreements which it may enter into thereafter;

(10) transactions to effect the Transactions and the payment of all fees and expenses related to the Transactions; (11) (a) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indenture which are fair to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party and (b) transactions with Joint Ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business;

Each Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Each Guarantee of a Guarantor shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the indenture described below. Any Parent of the Issuer may guarantee the notes on or after the Issue Date, but no value should be assigned to this guarantee, such guarantor will not be subject to the covenants of the indenture and such guarantee may be released at any time. Upon issuance thereof, the notes will be unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings, but Holdings will not be subject to the covenants of the indenture. 193 Table of Contents Each Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph, shall: (1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the obligations of the Issuer under the indenture and the notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or additional interest on the notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise; (2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors; and (3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors, transferees and assigns.

In the event that the expiration and non-renewal of In-Orbit Insurance for such a Satellite (or portion, as applicable) resulting from a claim of loss under such policy causes a failure to comply with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be in compliance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence for the 120 days immediately following such expiration or non-renewal, provided that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, procures such In-Orbit Insurance or provides such In-Orbit Contingency Protection as necessary to comply with the preceding proviso within such 120-day period. The insurance required by this covenant shall name the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary as the named insured. In the event of the unavailability of any In-Orbit Contingency Protection for any reason, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of the first paragraph of this covenant above, within 120 days of such unavailability, be required to have in effect In-Orbit Insurance complying with clause (ii) or (iii) of the first paragraph above, as applicable, with respect to all Satellites (or portions, as applicable), other than Excluded Satellites that the unavailable In-Orbit Contingency Protection was intended to protect and for so long as such In-Orbit Contingency Protection is unavailable, provided that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be considered in compliance with this insurance covenant for the 120 days immediately following such unavailability. In the event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries receives any Event of Loss Proceeds in respect of an Event of Loss, such Event of Loss Proceeds shall be applied in the manner provided for under Asset Sales. Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets The indenture provides that the Issuer may not consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person unless: (1) the Issuer is a surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition has been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof, under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or any Subsidiary or Parent of the Issuer or under the laws of Bermuda or any country that is a member of the European 195 Table of Contents Union (the Issuer or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the Successor Company); (2) the Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the indenture and the notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), either (a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock; or (b) the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or less than such ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and (5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the indenture. The Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Issuer under the indenture and the notes, and the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the indenture and the notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or amalgamate with, merge into, sell, assign or transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or to another Restricted Subsidiary and (b) the Issuer may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in a (or another) state of the United States, the District of Columbia, any territory of the United States, Bermuda or any country that is a member of the European Union so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby (any transaction described in this sentence a  Specified Merger/Transfer Transaction ). The indenture contains similar provisions relating to the consolidation, amalgamation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this covenant shall prevent any Subsidiary Transfer Transaction, which need not comply with this covenant. 196 Table of Contents Defaults An Event of Default is defined in the indenture as: (1) a default in any payment of interest on any note when due continues for 30 days, (2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise, (3) the failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in the notes or the indenture; provided , however , that to the extent such failure relates solely to an action or inaction by Intelsat General or another Government Business Subsidiary, and the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries have otherwise complied with the covenant described under Certain CovenantsMatters Relating to Government Business Subsidiaries, no Event of Default shall occur, (4) the failure by Holdings, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to a Parent of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $75.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent (the  cross-acceleration provision ), (5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Holdings, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (the  bankruptcy provisions ), or (6) the failure by Holdings, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $75.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts which are covered by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days (the  judgment default provision ). The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a default under clause (3) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of outstanding notes under the indenture notify the Issuer of the default and the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clause (3) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of outstanding notes under the indenture by notice to the Issuer may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences. 197 Table of Contents In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the notes, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events. Subject to the provisions of the indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes under the indenture have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy, (3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense, (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity, and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each holder of notes notice of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the noteholders. In addition, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. 198 Table of Contents Amendments and Waivers Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture may be amended with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding under the indenture and any past default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding under the indenture; provided that if any amendment, waiver or other modification would only affect the senior cash-pay notes or the senior election notes, as applicable, only the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding senior cash-pay notes or senior election notes (and not the consent of at least a majority in principal amount of all notes), as the case may be, shall be required. However, without the consent of each holder of such outstanding notes affected, no amendment may, among other things: (1) reduce the amount of such notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, (2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any note, (3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any note, (4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any note or change the time at which any note may be redeemed as described under Optional Redemption, (5) make any note payable in money other than that stated in such note, (6) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such holders notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holders notes, (7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holders consent or in the waiver provisions, or (8) expressly subordinate the notes to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder, the Issuer and the Trustee may amend the indenture to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for the assumption by a Successor Company of the obligations of the Issuer under the indenture and the notes, to provide for the assumption by a successor Guarantor of the obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under the indenture and its Guarantee, to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes ( provided that the uncertificated notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), to add Guarantees with respect to the notes, to secure the notes, to add to the covenants of the Issuer or any Parent of the Issuer for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Parent of the Issuer, to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder, to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the indenture under the TIA, to effect any provision of the indenture (including to release any Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the indenture) or to make certain changes to the indenture to provide for the issuance of additional notes. The consent of the noteholders is not necessary under the indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. After an amendment under the indenture becomes effective, the Issuer is required to mail to the noteholders under such indenture a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all noteholders entitled to receive such notice, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment. 199 Table of Contents No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator or holder of any Equity Interests in the Issuer (other than Holdings) or any Parent of the Issuer, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the notes or the indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws. Transfer and Exchange A noteholder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the registrar and the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuer may require a noteholder to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the indenture. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption or to transfer or exchange any note for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of notes to be redeemed. The notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of such note for all purposes. Satisfaction and Discharge The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration or transfer or exchange of notes, as expressly provided for in the indenture) as to any or all outstanding notes under the indenture when: (1) either (a) all the notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed notes which have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the notes (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Issuer, are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee funds in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes to the date of deposit together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuer directing the Trustee to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be; (2) the Issuer and/or the Guarantors, if any, have paid all other sums payable under the indenture; and (3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture have been complied with. Defeasance The Issuer at any time may terminate all its obligations under the notes and the indenture ( legal defeasance ), except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the notes, to replace mutilated, 200 Table of Contents destroyed, lost or stolen notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the notes. The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under certain covenants that are described in the indenture, including the covenants described under Certain Covenants, the operation of the cross-acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries and the judgment default provision described under Defaults and the undertakings and covenants contained under Change of Control and Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets ( covenant defeasance ). If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor, if any, will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guarantee. The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), or (6) under Defaults or because of the failure of the Issuer to comply with the undertakings and covenants contained under Change of Control or Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets. In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the  defeasance trust ) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the applicable issue of notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable federal income tax law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by the immediately preceding sentence with respect to a legal defeasance need not be delivered if all notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and payable or (y) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer. Concerning the Trustee Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the Trustee under the indenture and has been appointed by the Issuer as registrar and a paying agent with regard to the notes.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), in each case with respect to an operating unit of a business, and other operational changes that such Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has both determined to make and made after January 28, 2005 and during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations and other operational changes (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Adjusted EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term in excess of 12 months).

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

regulatory obligations or as a result of such employees termination, death or disability; provided , further , that any class of Capital Stock of such Person that by its terms authorizes such Person

The Global Notes initially were deposited upon issuance with the Trustee as custodian for DTC in New York, New York, and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant as described below. Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for exchange notes in certificated form except in the limited circumstances described below. See Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes. In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants, which may change from time to time. The notes may be presented for registration of transfer at the offices of the registrar. Depository Procedures The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the participants) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTCs system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the indirect participants). Persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the participants or the indirect participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the participants and indirect participants. Investors in the Global Notes who are participants in DTCs system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Global Notes who are not participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations which are participants in such system. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which 237 Table of Contents in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, we and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we, the Trustee nor any agent of us or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTCs records or any participants or indirect participants records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTCs records or any participants or indirect participants records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or indirect participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or us. Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and we and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTCs procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or changed at any time. Neither we, the 238 Table of Contents Trustee nor any agent of us or the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes A Global Note is exchangeable for definitive notes in registered certificated form (Certificated Notes) if DTC (A) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed or (B) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act. In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). Same Day Settlement and Payment We will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Global Note holder. We will make all payments of principal, interest and premium with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holders registered address. The notes represented by the Global Notes are eligible to trade in DTCs Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. We expect that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. 239 Table of Contents TAXATION Luxembourg This section describes the current material Luxembourg tax consequences of owning the notes. The following summary is of a general nature and is included herein solely for information purposes. It is the opinion of Elvinger, Hoss & Prussen, our special Luxembourg counsel. It is based on the laws presently in force in Luxembourg relating to the taxation of the notes for non-Luxembourg resident Noteholders, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. Prospective investors in the notes should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject. Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax ( impôt sur le revenu des collectivités ), municipal business tax ( impôt commercial communal ), a solidarity surcharge ( contribution au fonds de chômage ) as well as personal income tax ( impôt sur le revenu ) generally. Investors may further be subject to net wealth tax ( impôt sur la fortune ) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well. Withholding tax Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the laws of June 21, 2005 and December 23, 2005 as amended (the Laws) mentioned below, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to resident or non-resident holders of notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the notes held by non-resident holders of notes. Under the Laws implementing the Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments and ratifying the treaties entered into by Luxembourg and certain dependent and associated territories of EU Member States (the Territories), payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to or for the immediate benefit of an individual beneficial owner or a residual entity, as defined by the Laws, which are resident of, or established in, an EU Member State (other than Luxembourg) or one of the Territories will be subject to a withholding tax unless the relevant recipient has adequately instructed the relevant paying agent to provide details of the relevant payments of interest or similar income to the fiscal authorities of his/her/its country of residence or establishment, or, in the case of an individual beneficial owner, has provided a tax certificate issued by the fiscal authorities of his/her country of residence in the required format to the relevant paying agent. The withholding tax rate is 20% until June 30, 2011 and 35% thereafter. Interest payments made by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to an individual resident holder of notes acting in the course of management of its private wealth or to a 240 Table of Contents Luxembourg or foreign residual entity receiving the payment for the benefit of such holder of notes are, pursuant to the December 23, 2005 Luxembourg law as amended, subject to a 10% withholding tax (the 10% Luxembourg Tax). The 10% Luxembourg Tax also applies on accrued interest received upon sale, redemption or repurchase of the notes. Where the paying agent is located in a Member State of the European Union or of the European Economic Area other than Luxembourg or in a Territory, holders of notes who are Luxembourg residents can opt, pursuant to the December 23, 2005 Luxembourg law as amended, to self-declare and pay the 10% Luxembourg tax on interest payments made to them by the paying agent. The 10% Luxembourg Tax represents the final tax liability on interest received for holders of notes who are Luxembourg residents and receiving the interest payment in the course of their private wealth. Individual resident holders of notes that hold their notes as business assets must include the interest received or accrued in their taxable income. The 10% Luxembourg tax levied is then credited against the final tax liability of the holders of notes. Income taxation Non-resident holder of notes A non-resident holder of notes, not having a permanent establishment or permanent representative in Luxembourg to which such notes are attributable, is not subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the notes. A gain realized by such non-resident holder of notes on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the notes is further not subject to Luxembourg income tax. A non-resident undertaking with a collective character (i.e., corporate) holder of notes or an individual holder of notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent establishment or permanent representative in Luxembourg to which such notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the notes. Resident holder of notes Save where the holder of notes is exempt from taxation under Luxembourg law, a holder of notes who is an undertaking with a collective character or an individual holding the notes as business assets is subject to Luxembourg tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the notes. Individual holders of notes holding the notes as business assets will be allowed to credit the 10% Luxembourg Tax against their final tax liability. A gain realized by an individual holder of notes acting in the course of the management of his/ her private wealth, upon sale, disposal or redemption in any form whatsoever of the notes is subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided that the sale, disposal or redemption took place within six months after the notes were acquired. Upon the sale, redemption or disposal of the notes, accrued but unpaid interest will be subject to the 10% Luxembourg tax (see above). Net wealth taxationnon-resident holders of notes Save where the holder of notes is exempt from taxation under Luxembourg law, a corporate holder of notes, whether it is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes or, if not, maintains a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in Luxembourg to which such 241 Table of Contents notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg wealth tax on such notes. An individual holder of notes, whether he/she is resident of Luxembourg or not, is not subject to Luxembourg wealth tax on such notes. Other taxes Neither the issuance nor the transfer of notes will give rise to any Luxembourg stamp duty, value added tax, issuance tax, registration tax, transfer tax or similar taxes or duties. Luxembourg gift tax will be levied on the transfer of a Note by way or gift by the Noteholder if the gift is registered in Luxembourg. If a holder of notes is not a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the notes are not included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes. Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed or recorded in Luxembourg. When used in the preceding paragraphs, interest, paying agent and residual entity have the meaning given thereto in the Council Directive 2003/48/EC, the Luxembourg laws of June 21, 2005 and December 23, 2005, as amended. Interest will include accrued or capitalised interest at the sale, repayment or redemption of the notes. The foregoing is based upon the law as in effect on the date hereof and is subject to any law or regulation that may take effect after such date, and may be retroactively applicable. EU Savings Directive Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, each Member State of the EU is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual beneficial owner resident in, or certain limited types of entity established in, that other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg will (unless during such period such Member States elect otherwise) instead operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. Under such withholding system, tax will be deducted unless the recipient of the payment elects instead for an exchange of information procedure. The current rate of withholding is 20% and it will be increased to 35% with effect from July 1, 2011. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to exchange of information procedures relating to interest and other similar income. A number of non-EU countries and certain dependent or associated territories of certain Member States have adopted or agreed to adopt similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within their respective jurisdictions to an individual beneficial owner resident in, or certain limited types of entity established in, a Member State. In addition, the Member States have entered into provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those countries and territories in relation to payments made by a person in a Member State to an individual beneficial owner resident in, or certain limited types of entity established in, one of those countries or territories. On November 13, 2008 the European Commission published a proposal for amendments to the Savings Directive. The proposal included a number of suggested changes which, if implemented, would broaden the scope of the rules described above. The European Parliament approved an amended version of this proposal on April 24, 2009. 242 Table of Contents U.S. Federal Income Taxation TO COMPLY WITH TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL TAX ISSUES IN THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY ANY TAXPAYER, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE TAXPAYER UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE; (B) ANY SUCH DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED HEREIN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING (WITHIN THE MEANING OF CIRCULAR 230) OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) A TAXPAYER SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THE TAXPAYERS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR. The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes by a U.S. holder (as defined below), but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects and does not address the effects of any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, and the medicare tax on net investment income. It is the opinion of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, LLP, our U.S. counsel. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all of the U.S federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holders particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities and investors therein, persons liable for alternative minimum tax and persons holding the notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the notes for cash at original issue and who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes. We currently do not believe that we have been or will be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See Risk FactorsRisk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness and the NotesThe Intelstat companies might be subject to unanticipated taxes, and a holders income on the notes might be treated as income from 243 Table of Contents U.S. sources. The remainder of the discussion below assumes this treatment but non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors about the consequences to them (including withholding tax consequences) if that were not the case. Prospective purchasers of the notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well the application of state, local, foreign or other tax laws. Payment of Additional Amounts The Issuer is required at the option of holders to redeem notes at a specified premium in the event of a change in control. This may cause the notes to be subject to special rules for debt instruments with contingent payments unless the likelihood of the event that would result in such payment is remote or the amount of such payment is incidental. We believe that as of the expected issue date of the notes, such contingencies are remote and/or incidental and that the notes are therefore not subject to special rules governing contingent payment debt instruments. In each case, that determination is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), and if the IRS were successfully to challenge this determination, or if any such contingencies were actually to occur, the amount, timing and character of income from the notes could be different from that described below. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the rules applicable to notes that provide for contingent payments. The remaining discussion assumes that the notes are not contingent payment debt instruments. 2017 Notes Payments of Interest on 2017 Notes Subject to the discussion of amortizable bond premium below, payments of stated interest on the 2017 notes generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holders method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest income on a 2017 note generally will be foreign source passive category income or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, general category income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Original Issue Discount The 2017 notes may be issued with OID. U.S. holders of notes issued with OID generally must include OID in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of tax accounting. As a result, U.S. holders holding notes issued with OID will include OID in income as ordinary income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. A class of notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated redemption price at maturity of that class of notes exceeds its issue price by an amount equal to or more than a de minimis amount. Such excess will be de minimis if it is less than an amount equal to 0.0025 multiplied by the stated redemption price at maturity and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date. The stated redemption price at maturity of a note will include all payments on the note other than payments of qualified stated interest. Stated interest on the 2017 notes will be treated as qualified stated interest. The issue price of the 2017 notes is not 244 Table of Contents entirely clear. Generally, the issue price of a note is the first price at which a substantial amount of notes included in the issue of which the note is a part is sold to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. The original notes were issued at a stated offering price of par to refinance bridge loans with substantially the same terms. On that basis, we intend to take the position, to the extent we are required to adopt a position, that the issue price of the notes is their stated principal amount. However, the IRS may take the position that the issue price was established by the first price at which a substantial amount of notes was sold to public investors, if any, who were not participants in the bridge loans. The notes were sold by the underwriters in individually negotiated transactions and we have been unable to determine the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes was sold to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers or holders of bridge loans. Accordingly, it is possible the notes were issued with OID. Sale, Exchange, Retirement, or Other Taxable Disposition of 2017 Notes Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a 2017 note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income tax by the U.S. holder) and the adjusted tax basis of the 2017 note. A U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in a senior note will, in general, be its cost for that 2017 note, increased by any OID and any market discount you previously elected to include in income prior to the disposition and decreased by any previously amortized bond premium (as described below). Subject to the discussion of market discount below, any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of noncorporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. 2017 PIK Notes Original Issue Discount The 2017 PIK notes will be treated as issued with OID in an amount equal to the difference between their stated redemption price at maturity (the sum of all payments to be made on the senior PIK notes other than qualified stated interest) and their issue price. The issue price of the 2017 PIK notes is not entirely clear. Generally, the issue price of a note is the first price at which a substantial amount of notes included in the issue of which the note is a part is sold to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. The original notes were issued at a stated offering price of par to refinance bridge loans with substantially the same terms. On that basis, we intend to take the position, to the extent we are required to adopt a position, that the issue price of the notes is their stated principal amount. However, the IRS may take the position that the issue price was established by the first price at which a substantial amount of notes was sold to public investors, if any, who were not participants in the bridge loans. The notes were sold by the underwriters in individually negotiated transactions and we have been unable to determine the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes was sold to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar 245 Table of Contents persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers or holders of bridge loans. The term qualified stated interest means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than our debt instruments of the Issuer) at least annually at a single fixed rate or, subject to certain conditions, based on one or more interest indices. Because the Issuer has the option for any interest period through February 4, 2013 to make interest payments in PIK Interest instead of paying cash, none of the stated interest payments on the senior PIK notes will be qualified stated interest. Accordingly, the 2017 PIK notes will be treated as issued with OID. A U.S. holder generally must include OID in its gross income as it accrues over the term of the 2017 PIK notes without regard to its regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and regardless of whether interest is currently paid in cash. The amount of OID a U.S. holder will be required to include in income will generally equal the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the 2017 PIK notes for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which the U.S. holder held such 2017 PIK note (accrued OID). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The accrual period for a 2017 PIK note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the 2017 PIK note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the product of the 2017 PIK notes adjusted issue price at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period). OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. The yield to maturity of the 2017 PIK notes is that discount rate (compounded in a manner appropriate to the accrual period chosen) at which all payments to be made on the 2017 PIK Notes would be equal to the issue price of the 2017 PIK Notes. The adjusted issue price of a 2017 PIK note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period and reduced by any cash payments made on such 2017 PIK note on or before the first day of the accrual period. To determine the amount of OID that a U.S holder must include in income, we will assume, as required by the Treasury regulations, that we will make or not make elections to call the notes and to accrue, rather than to pay, interest in a manner that minimizes the yield on the notes. Based on the anticipated price of the notes, we will assume that none of the interest will be paid in cash. These assumptions are made solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and do not constitute a representation by us regarding the actual amounts, or the timing of amounts, that will be paid on the notes. If for any interest payment period the Issuer exercises its option to pay interest in the form of PIK Interest on the 2017 PIK notes, a U.S. holder will not be required to adjust its OID calculation for future periods. If the Issuer in fact pays cash or any partial PIK Interest on the notes prior to February 15, 2013, the cash payment is treated not as a payment of accrued interest, but instead as a pro rata prepayment in retirement of a portion of a note (the Pro Rata Prepayment), which may result in a gain or loss to the holder. Generally, the gain or loss is calculated by assuming that the note consists of two instruments, one that is retired and one that remains outstanding. The adjusted issue price, holders adjusted basis, and accrued but unpaid OID of the note, determined immediately before the Pro Rata Prepayment, are allocated between these two instruments based on the portion of the instrument that is treated as retired by the Pro Rata Prepayment. 246 Table of Contents Interest income (including OID) on a note generally will be foreign source passive category income or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, general category income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Sale, Exchange, Retirement, or Other Taxable Disposition of 2017 PIK Notes Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a 2017 PIK note (or a new 2017 PIK note), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition and the adjusted tax basis of the 2017 PIK note (or the new 2017 PIK note). A U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in a 2017 PIK note will, in general, be its cost for the 2017 PIK note, increased by OID and/or market discount previously included in income and reduced by any cash payments on the 2017 PIK note. Although not free from doubt, a U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in a 2017 PIK note should be allocated between the original 2017 PIK note and any new 2017 PIK notes received in respect of PIK Interest thereon in proportion to their relative principal amounts. A U.S. holders holding period in any new 2017 PIK note received in respect of PIK Interest would likely be identical to its holding period for the original 2017 PIK note with respect to which the new 2017 PIK note was received. Subject to the market rules described below, any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of noncorporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Market Discount If a U.S. holder acquires a note at a cost that is less than its issue price, the amount of such difference is treated as market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless such difference is de minimis . Such difference will be de minimis if it is an amount less than .0025 multiplied by the stated redemption price at maturity of the note multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity of the note (from the date of acquisition). Under the market discount rules of the Code, a U.S. holder is required to treat any payment that does not constitute a payment of qualified stated interest on, or any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of, a note as ordinary income to the extent of the accrued market discount that has not previously been included in income. If such note is disposed of by the U.S. holder in certain otherwise nontaxable transactions, accrued market discount must be included as ordinary income by the U.S. holder as if the holder sold the note at its then fair market value. In general, the amount of market discount that has accrued is determined on a ratable basis. A U.S. holder may, however, elect to determine the amount of accrued market discount on a constant yield to maturity basis. This election is made on a note-by-note basis and is irrevocable. With respect to notes with market discount, a U.S. holder may not be allowed to deduct immediately a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or to carry the notes. A U.S. holder may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues, in which case the interest deferral rule set forth in the preceding sentence will not apply. This election will apply to all debt instruments acquired by the U.S. holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holders tax basis in a note will be increased by the amount of market discount included in the holders income under the election. 247 Table of Contents Acquisition Premium If a U.S. holder purchases a note issued with OID at an acquisition premium, the amount of OID that the U.S. holder includes in gross income is reduced to reflect the acquisition premium. A note is purchased at an acquisition premium if its adjusted basis, immediately after its purchase, is (a) less than or equal to the sum of all amounts payable on the note after the purchase date other than payments of qualified stated interest and (b) greater than the notes issue price. If a note is purchased at an acquisition premium, the U.S. holder reduces the amount of OID that otherwise would be included in income during an accrual period by an amount equal to (i) the amount of the OID otherwise includible in income multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of the adjusted basis of the note immediately after its acquisition by the purchaser over the issue price of the note and the denominator of which is the excess of the sum of all amounts payable on the note after the purchase date, other than payments of qualified stated interest, over the notes issue price. As an alternative to reducing the amount of OID that otherwise would be included in income by this fraction, the U.S. holder may elect to compute OID accruals by applying the constant yield method described above. Amortizable Bond Premium with Respect to the Notes If a U.S. holder purchases a note for an amount in excess of the sum of all amounts payable on the note after the date of acquisition (other than payments of qualified stated interests), the holder will be considered to have purchased the note with amortizable bond premium equal in amount to the excess, and generally will not be required to include OID on the note, if any, in income. Generally, a U.S. holder may elect to amortize the premium as an offset to qualified stated interest income, using a constant yield method similar to that described above, over the remaining term of the note. The notes are subject to call provisions at the Issuers option at various times, as described in Description of the NotesOptional Redemption. A U.S. holder will calculate the amount of amortizable bond premium based on the amount payable at the applicable call date, but only if use of the call date (in lieu of the stated maturity date) results in a smaller amortizable bond premium through the period ending on the call date. A U.S. holder who elects to amortize bond premium must reduce the holders tax basis in the note by the amount of the premium used to offset qualified stated interest income as set forth above. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations then owned and thereafter acquired by the holder and may be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding In general, information reporting requirements will apply to certain payments of interest (including OID) paid on the notes and to the proceeds of the sale, retirement, redemption or other disposition of a note paid to U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, such as a corporation. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 248 Table of Contents Recently enacted legislation requires certain U.S. holders to report information with respect to their investment in notes not held through a custodial account with a U.S. financial institution to the IRS. Investors who fail to report required information could become subject to substantial penalties. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this new legislation on their investment in notes. 249 Table of Contents CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS To ensure compliance with Treasury Department rules, we inform you that this summary was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on any taxpayer. This summary was written to support the promotion or marketing of the transactions addressed by this prospectus. Each taxpayer should seek advice based on such taxpayer´s particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor. ERISA imposes certain requirements on employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to ERISA, including entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans (collectively, ERISA Plans), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISAs general fiduciary requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plans investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plans particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under Risk Factors and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of any notes it may acquire. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those pension, profit-sharing and other retirement plans and accounts that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and entities that are deemed to hold assets of any of the foregoing) and certain persons (referred to as parties in interest or disqualified persons) having certain relationships to such plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Governmental plans, foreign plans and certain church plans not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code may nevertheless be subject to foreign, federal, state or local laws that are materially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (any such law a Similar Law, and such plans, collectively with ERISA Plans and plans subject to Section 4975 of the Code, Plans). Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if notes are acquired by a Plan with respect to which the issuer or any of its affiliates is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction class exemption (PTCE) 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager); PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts); PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager) and PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts). There can be no assurance that any of these class exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes. 250 Table of Contents Each person that acquires the notes will be deemed by such acquisition to have represented and warranted that either: (i) no assets of any Plan have been used to acquire the notes or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the notes will not result in non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code and will not result in a violation of Similar Law. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering acquiring or holding the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan consult with counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law to such transactions. The sale of any notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the issuer that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan. 251 Table of Contents PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The notes offered hereby may be sold from time to time by the selling securityholders for their own accounts. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the notes in this offer. The selling securityholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of the notes in this offer. We will pay substantially all expenses in connection with the offering and the sale of the notes to the public, including legal fees and disbursements of counsel, blue sky expenses, accounting fees and filing fees, but excluding any brokerage commissions, discounts or similar charges. Resale of the notes by the selling securityholders are not subject to any underwriting agreement. The notes covered by this prospectus may be sold by the selling securityholders or by their permitted pledgees, donees, transferees, beneficiaries, distributees or successors-in-interest selling notes received after the date of this prospectus from selling securityholders as a gift, pledge, partnership distribution or other non-sale related transfer. In addition, certain of the selling securityholders are corporations or partnerships which may, in the future, distribute their notes to their securityholders or partners, respectively. Those notes may later be sold by those securityholders or partners. The selling securityholders will act independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale. The notes offered by each selling securityholders may be sold from time to time:  at fixed prices;  at prevailing market prices at the time of sale;  at prices relating to such prevailing market prices;  at varying prices determined at the time of sale; or  at negotiated prices. Such sales may be effected in the over-the-counter market, otherwise than in the over-the-counter market or by any combination of such methods of sale. We will supply the selling securityholders with reasonable quantities of this prospectus. The notes may be sold by one or more of the following:  one or more block trades in which a broker or dealer so engaged will attempt to sell all or a portion of the notes held by the selling securityholders as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  purchases by a broker or dealer as principal and resale by such broker or dealer for its account pursuant to this prospectus;  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers;  in negotiated transactions; and  through other means. To the extent permitted by law, the selling securityholders may enter into hedging transactions when selling the notes. For example, the selling securityholders may:  sell notes short and redeliver such notes to close out their short positions;  enter into transactions involving short sales by the brokers or dealers;  enter into option or other types of transactions that require the selling securityholders to deliver notes to a broker or dealer, who then resells or transfer the notes under this prospectus; or  loan or pledge the notes to a broker or dealer, who may sell the loaned notes or, in the event of default, sell the pledged notes. 252 Table of Contents There is no assurance that any of the selling securityholders will sell any or all of the notes offered by them. The selling securityholders may effect sales through customary brokerage channels, either through broker-dealers acting as agents or brokers, or through broker-dealers acting as principals, who may then resell the notes, or at private sales or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. The selling securityholders may effect such transactions by selling notes to or through broker-dealers, and such broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions, commissions or fees from the selling securityholders and/or purchasers of the notes for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent or to whom they sell as principal, or both (which compensation to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary commissions). The selling securityholders may further agree to indemnify any broker-dealer or agent against certain liabilities related to the selling of the notes, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. Any broker-dealers that participate with the selling securityholders in the distribution of the notes may be deemed to be underwriters, and any commissions received by them and any profit on the resale of the notes positioned by them might be deemed to be underwriting compensation, within the meaning of the Securities Act, in connection with such sales. To the extent required, this prospectus may be amended or supplemented from time to time to describe a specific plan of distribution. Any notes covered by the prospectus that qualify for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than pursuant to this prospectus. In addition to selling the notes, the selling securityholders may transfer the notes by gift, distribution or other transfer not involving market makers or established trading markets. 253 Table of Contents LEGAL MATTERS The validity of the new notes and the guarantees will be passed upon for us by Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, special U.S. counsel to Intelsat Luxembourg, as to New York law, and by Elvinger, Hoss & Prussen, special Luxembourg counsel to Intelsat Luxembourg, as to Luxembourg law.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Intelsat S.A. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Intelsat S.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007 (predecessor entity), the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 (predecessor entity), the period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 (successor entity) and the year ended December 31, 2009 (successor entity), in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. F-6 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 Background of Company Intelsat S.A. (Intelsat, we, us or our) provides satellite communications services worldwide through a global communications network of 54 satellites in orbit as of December 31, 2009 and ground facilities related to the satellite operations and control, and teleport services. On December 15, 2009, Intelsat, Ltd. and certain of its parent holding companies and subsidiaries migrated their jurisdiction of organization from Bermuda to Luxembourg (the Migration). As a result of the Migration, our headquarters are located in Luxembourg. Each company that migrated has continued its corporate and legal personality in Luxembourg. Subsequent to the Migration, Intelsat Global, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat Global S.A., Intelsat Global Subsidiary, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat Global Subsidiary S.A., Intelsat Holdings, Ltd. (Intelsat Holdings) is now known as Intelsat Holdings S.A., Intelsat, Ltd. is now known as Intelsat S.A., Intelsat (Bermuda), Ltd., (Intelsat Bermuda) is now known as Intelsat (Luxembourg) S.A. (Intelsat Luxembourg), Intelsat Jackson Holdings, Ltd. (Intelsat Jackson) is now known as Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A., Intelsat Intermediate Holding Company, Ltd. (Intermediate Holdco) is now known as Intelsat Intermediate Holding Company S.A. and Intelsat Subsidiary Holding Company, Ltd. (Intelsat Sub Holdco) is now known as Intelsat Subsidiary Holding Company S.A. The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization INTELSAT (the IGO) was established on an interim basis in 1964. The IGO was formally established on February 12, 1973 in accordance with the provisions of an intergovernmental agreement (the INTELSAT Agreement) and an operating agreement (the Operating Agreement). The parties to the INTELSAT Agreement were the IGOs 148 member countries. Substantially all of the IGOs assets, liabilities, rights, obligations and operations were transferred to Intelsat, Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries on July 18, 2001 in a transaction referred to as the privatization. The IGOs shareholders received shares in Intelsat, Ltd., a company originally organized under the laws of Bermuda, in proportion to their ownership in the IGO on the privatization date and became holders of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Intelsat. On January 28, 2005, Intelsat, Ltd. was acquired by Intelsat Holdings, formerly known as Zeus Holdings, Limited, a Bermuda company formed at the direction of funds advised by or associated with Apax Partners Worldwide LLP and Apax Partners, L.P., Apollo Management V, L.P., MDP Global Investors, Limited and Permira Advisers LLC. On July 3, 2006, Intelsat Bermuda, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Intelsat Holdings, completed the acquisition of PanAmSat Holding Corporation (PanAmSat Holdco) pursuant to a merger agreement dated as of August 28, 2005, by and among Intelsat Bermuda, Proton Acquisition Corporation (Merger Sub), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intelsat Bermuda, and PanAmSat Holdco (the Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into PanAmSat Holdco, with PanAmSat Holdco surviving the merger (the Merger Transaction). Upon completion of the Merger Transaction, PanAmSat Holdcos equity holders ceased to hold shares or other equity interest in PanAmSat Holdco. On July 3, 2006, following the completion of the acquisition, PanAmSat Holdco was renamed Intelsat Holding Corporation and PanAmSat Corporation was renamed Intelsat Corporation (Intelsat Corporation). Upon completion of the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions (as defined below), PanAmSat Holdco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intelsat Bermuda. F-7 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) In connection with, and in order to effect, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the related financing, Intelsat Bermuda created a new direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Intermediate Holdco. Intelsat Bermuda transferred substantially all of its assets (other than cash, certain prepaid expenses and the capital stock of Merger Sub) and liabilities to Intermediate Holdco. In addition, on July 3, 2006, we incurred approximately $3.5 billion of additional debt and assumed $3.2 billion of outstanding debt to finance the Merger Transaction. Also, on July 3, 2006 Intelsat Sub Holdco terminated its prior senior secured credit facilities and entered into new senior secured credit facilities under a credit agreement, to change certain of the terms thereunder. These transactions and the Merger Transaction are collectively referred to as the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions. On February 4, 2008, Serafina Acquisition Limited (Serafina) completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity ownership of Intelsat Holdings for total cash consideration of approximately $5.0 billion, pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 19, 2007 (the BC Share Purchase Agreement), among Serafina, Intelsat Holdings, certain shareholders of Intelsat Holdings and Serafina Holdings Limited (Serafina Holdings), the direct parent of Serafina. This transaction is referred to as the New Sponsors Acquisition (see Note 3New Sponsors Acquisition). Although the effective date of the New Sponsors Acquisition was February 4, 2008, due to the immateriality of the results of operations for the period between February 1, 2008 and February 4, 2008, we have accounted for the New Sponsors Acquisition as if it had occurred on February 1, 2008, except for acquisition transactions costs which were recorded within the predecessor period of January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 represent the predecessor entity. The period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009 represent the successor entity. As a result of the application of purchase accounting, the consolidated financial statements of the predecessor entity are not comparable with the consolidated financial statements of the successor entity, because they are, in effect, those of a new entity. Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies (a) Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intelsat, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and a joint venture with Convergence SPV, Ltd. (Convergence Partners) named New Dawn Satellite Company Ltd., of which we have a 74.9% interest and, as more fully described in Note 9Investments, we account for the percentage interest in New Dawn that we do not own as a minority interest. Investments where we exercise significant influence but do not control (generally 20% to 50% ownership interest) are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are periodically reviewed for impairment. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. (b) Use of Estimates The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make F-8 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples of estimates include the determination of fair value with respect to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the New Sponsors Acquisition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, pension and postretirement benefits, the fair value of our derivative instruments, the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest, the fair value of share-based and other compensation awards, income taxes, useful lives of satellites, intangible assets and other property and equipment, the recoverability of goodwill and the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets. Changes in such estimates may affect amounts reported in future periods. (c) Revenue Recognition We earn revenue primarily from satellite utilization charges and, to a lesser extent, from providing managed services to customers. We enter into contracts with customers to provide satellite transponders and transponder capacity and, in certain cases, earth stations and teleport facilities, for periods typically ranging from one year to the life of the satellite. Our revenue recognition policies by product or service offering are as follows: Satellite Utilization Charge. We generally recognize revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the related customer contract unless collectability is not reasonably assured. Revenues from occasional use services are recognized ratably as the services are performed. We have certain obligations, including providing spare or substitute capacity if available, in the event of satellite service failure under certain long-term agreements. Except for certain deposits, we are not obligated to refund satellite utilization payments previously made. Satellite Related Consulting and Technical Service. Revenues earned from the provision of consulting services by employee specialists are typically recognized on a monthly basis as those services are performed. Consulting services, which call for services with specific deliverables, such as Transfer Orbit Support Services or training programs, are typically recognized upon the completion of those services. Revenue from the provision of market research materials is recognized on a monthly basis as those services are performed. Tracking, Telemetry and Control (TT&C). We earn TT&C services revenue from providing operational services to other satellite owners and from certain customers on our satellites. The TT&C services are performed by our consulting/technical services group. TT&C agreements entered into in connection with our satellite utilization contracts are typically for the period of the related service agreement and are recognized ratably over the term of the service agreement. We also earn revenue for TT&C services in relation to our satellite utilization agreements with customers. Fees for such services are either included in the customers utilization charges or billed separately. In-Orbit Backup Services and Equipment Sale. We provide back-up transponder capacity that is held on reserve for certain customers on agreed upon terms. We recognize revenues for in-orbit protection services ratably over the term of the related agreement. We also record revenue related to equipment sales, which represents equipment purchased, constructed or developed on behalf of the customers. We recognize revenue related to these equipment sales upon transfer to the customer of title to the equipment. Revenue Share Arrangements. We recognize revenues under revenue share agreements for satellite-related services either on a gross or net basis in accordance the Principal Agent F-9 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Considerations topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (the Codification) which provides guidance and clarifies when an entity should report revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent, depending on the nature of the specific contractual relationship. Construction Program Management. Construction program management arrangements that extend beyond one year are accounted for in accordance with the Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts topic of the Codification . We generally record long-term, fixed price, development and production contracts utilizing the percentage of completion method as the basis to measure progress towards completion of the contract and for recognizing revenues. Progress towards contract completion is measured when achieving performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method. We may sell these services individually or in some combination to our customers. When these products and services are sold together, we account for the multiple elements under FASB ASC Topic 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements (FASB ASC 605-25). FASB ASC 605-25 provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. We allocate revenue for transactions or collaborations that include multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value, and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met. We recognize revenue for delivered elements having stand-alone value when we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element. When we determine that the delivered element does not have stand-alone value, or when the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated for the undelivered element, the revenue is deferred and recognized over the period the services are performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any undelivered elements. (d) Fair Value Measurements We estimate the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. On January 1, 2008, we prospectively adopted FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (FASB ASC 820), which defines fair value as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosure of the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities, the inputs utilized in calculating valuation measurements, and the effect of the measurement of significant unobservable inputs on earnings, or changes in net assets, as of the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs utilized in the measurement and valuation of financial assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We performed an evaluation of our financial assets and liabilities that met the criteria of the disclosure requirements and fair value framework of FASB ASC 820. As a result of that F-10 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) evaluation, we identified investments in marketable securities, interest rate financial derivative instruments, embedded derivative instruments and a redeemable noncontrolling interest as having met such criteria. We account for our investments in marketable securities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320, InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities . All investments have been classified as available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and are included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and declines in fair value on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense), net within our consolidated statements of operations. Interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are included in interest expense, net and other income (expense), net, respectively, within the consolidated statements of operations. We determined that the valuation measurement inputs of these marketable securities represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and, accordingly, have classified such investments within Level 1 of the Section 820 fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our interest rate financial derivative instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive to terminate the agreement at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates, the market expectation for future interest rates and current creditworthiness of both the counterparties and ourselves. Observable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation technique incorporate identical contractual notional amounts, fixed coupon rates, periodic terms for interest payments and contract maturity. Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments, if any, associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as the estimates of current credit spread, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us or our counterparties. We also considered the existence of offset provisions and other credit enhancements that serve to reduce the credit exposure associated with the asset or liability being fair valued. We have assessed the significance of the inputs of the credit valuation adjustments to the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We account for a contingent put option embedded within Sub Holdcos 8 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2015, Series B (the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes) under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (FASB ASC 815), bifurcating the put option from the debt host instrument and classifying it as a derivative instrument. We estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative on the issuance date and subsequently revalue the derivative at the end of each reporting period, recognizing any change in fair value through earnings. We use a standard valuation technique whereby the critical assumptions and underlyings include the debt maturity date, issue price, coupon rate, change of control put price, and the estimated date of a change in control. We have identified the inputs used to calculate the fair value as Level 3 inputs and have concluded that the valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In accordance with the guidance provided in FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , regarding the classification and measurement of redeemable securities, F-11 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) we mark to market the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in New Dawn Satellite Company Ltd (New Dawn), a majority owned subsidiary which is a joint venture investment with Convergence SPV Ltd. (Convergence Partners), at each reporting period. Convergence Partners has at its option the ability to require Intelsat to buy its ownership interest at fair value subsequent to the operations of New Dawns assets for a period defined in the New Dawn Project Agreement. We estimated the fair value of the put option using Level 3 inputs such as the discounted cash flows. (e) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and generally consist of time deposits with banks and money market funds. The carrying amount of these investments approximates market value. (f) Receivables and Concentration of Credit Risk We provide satellite services and extend credit to numerous customers in the satellite communication, telecommunications and video markets. To the extent that the credit quality of customers deteriorates, we may have exposure to credit losses. Management monitors its exposure to credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses. Management believes it has adequate customer collateral and reserves to cover its exposure. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an evaluation of the aging of our accounts receivable, and considers such factors as the likelihood of collection based upon an evaluation of the customers creditworthiness, the customers payment history and other conditions or circumstances that may affect the likelihood of payment, such as political and economic conditions in the country in which the customer is located. When we have determined that the collection of payments for satellite utilization or managed services is not reasonably assured at the time the service is provided, we defer recognition of the revenue until such time as collection is believed to be reasonably assured or the payment is received. If our estimate of the likelihood of collection differs from actual results, we may experience lower revenue or an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts. (g) Satellites and Other Property and Equipment Satellites and other property and equipment are stated at historical cost, or in the case of certain satellites acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, and consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentives expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers, costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. F-12 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Satellite construction and launch services are generally procured under long-term contracts that provide for payments over the contract periods. Satellite construction and launch services costs are capitalized to reflect progress toward completion. Capitalizing these costs typically coincides with contract milestone payment schedules. Performance incentives payable in future periods are dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites in service. Satellites and other property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: Years Buildings and improvements 10  40 Satellites and related costs 11  17 Ground segment equipment and software 4  15 Furniture and fixtures and computer hardware 4  12 Leasehold improvements 2  12 (h) Other Assets Other assets consist of investments in certain equity securities, unamortized debt issuance costs, long-term deposits, long-term receivables and other miscellaneous deferred charges and long-term assets. Debt issuance costs, which represent our costs incurred to secure debt financing, are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method, over the life of the related indebtedness. (i) Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date. The portion of the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price involves estimates and judgments by us that may be adjusted during the allocation period. In arriving at the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we consider the following generally accepted valuation approaches: the cost approach, income approach, and market approach. Our estimates may also include assumptions about projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, tax amortization periods, technology royalty rates and technology life cycles, the regulatory and legal environment, and industry and economic trends. (j) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (FASB ASC 350). Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested on an annual basis for impairment during the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The impairment test compares the reporting units carrying value to its fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of goodwill is reduced to fair value (see Note 10Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). F-13 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets arising from business combinations are initially recorded at fair value. Other intangible assets not arising from business combinations are initially recorded at cost. Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of backlog, customer relationships, and technologies and are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption. We review these intangible assets for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable (see Note 10Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). (k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and acquired intangible assets with estimable useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. These indicators of impairment can include, but are not limited to, the following:  satellite anomalies, such as a partial or full loss of power;  under-performance of an asset as compared to expectations; and  shortened useful lives due to changes in the way an asset is used or expected to be used. The recoverability of an asset to be held and used is determined by comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Additionally, when assets are expected to be used in future periods, a shortened depreciable life may be utilized if appropriate, resulting in accelerated depreciation. (l) Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (FASB ASC 740). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statements and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards, using the enacted marginal tax rate. We are subject to income taxes in the United States as well as a number of foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of our deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based in part on the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize the deferred tax assets. During the ordinary course of business, there are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We evaluate our tax positions to F-14 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and having access to all relevant facts and information. When a tax position does not meet the more likely than not standard, a liability is recorded for the entire amount of the unrecognized tax benefit. Additionally, for those tax positions that are determined more likely than not to be sustainable, we measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit more likely than not (determined by cumulative probability) to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. (m) Currency and Exchange Rates Substantially all customer contracts, capital expenditure contracts and operating expense obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, we do not believe that we are exposed to material currency exchange risk. (n) Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting shareholders equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income. For us, such items consist primarily of, the change in the market value of available-for-sale securities and minimum pension liability adjustments. (o) Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 718, CompensationStock Compensation (FASB ASC 718). (p) Deferred Satellite Performance Incentives The cost of satellite construction includes an element of deferred consideration to satellite manufacturers referred to as satellite performance incentives. We are contractually obligated to make these payments over the lives of the satellites, provided the satellites continue to operate in accordance with contractual specifications. Historically, the satellite manufacturers have earned substantially all of these payments. Therefore, we account for these payments as deferred financing. We capitalize the present value of these payments as part of the cost of the satellites and record a corresponding liability to the satellite manufacturers. Interest expense is recognized on the deferred financing and the liability is accreted upward based on the passage of time and reduced as the payments are made. (q) Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations, cash flows or retained earnings. (r) New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-1 Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Topic 105), which establishes the Codification as the official single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP, superseding existing literature issued by F-15 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) the FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) and related literature. The Codification became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after September 15, 2009, after which only one level of authoritative U.S. GAAP exists and all other literature is considered non-authoritative. The Codification does not change existing U.S. GAAP. The Codification was effective for our third quarter 2009 financial statements and the principal impact on our financial statements is limited to disclosures as all future references to authoritative accounting literature will be referenced in accordance with the Codification. Pursuant to the provisions of Topic 105, we have updated references to U.S. GAAP in our financial statements issued for the period ended December 31, 2009. The adoption of Topic 105 did not impact our financial position or results of operations. Accounting pronouncements issued prior to the Codification will continue to be referenced by their original issuance reference for consistency with prior period filings. We have also provided the Codification topic into which the accounting guidance has been incorporated subsequent to its original issuance. In September 2009, the FASB amended the Revenue RecognitionMultiple Element Arrangements topic of the Codification. Currently, the absence of vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) or third party evidence (TPE) of the fair value of the undelivered item(s) in an arrangement with multiple deliverables is one of the most common reasons entities are unable to recognize revenue on items that have been delivered. The amendment modifies the fair value requirements by providing an alternative for establishing fair value of a deliverable. In instances where VSOE or TPE of the fair value for any of the deliverables in an arrangement is unavailable, the entity may develop a best estimate of the selling price for those deliverables and allocate the arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. Application of the residual method of allocating an arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted. Additionally, entities will be required to disclose more information about their multiple-element revenue arrangements. This amendment will be effective and applied prospectively to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 with early adoption permitted. We intend to adopt the amended revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2010 and do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assetsan amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 166). Subsequent to the issuance of this accounting pronouncement, SFAS No. 166 has been incorporated into the Codification under FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing , which establishes accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets. SFAS No. 166 is intended to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements related to a transfer of financial assets, the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows, and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. SFAS No. 166 will be effective at the start of the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009. We have evaluated the requirements of SFAS No. 166 and noted that the adoption of SFAS No. 166 will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS No. 167). Subsequent to the issuance of this accounting pronouncement, F-16 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) SFAS No. 167 has been incorporated into the Codification under FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidations . SFAS No. 167 is intended to address the effects on certain provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept in SFAS No. 166 and constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those in which the accounting and disclosures under FIN 46(R) do not always provide timely and useful information about an entitys involvement in a variable interest entity. SFAS No. 167 will be effective at the start of the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009. We have evaluated the requirements of SFAS No. 167 and its effect to our unconsolidated variable interest entities, and do not believe that the adoption of the standard will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. Note 3 New Sponsors Acquisition On February 4, 2008, Serafina completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity ownership of Intelsat Holdings for total cash consideration of approximately $5.0 billion, pursuant to the BC Share Purchase Agreement. The former shareholders of Intelsat Holdings (other than management) sold 100% of their equity interests in Intelsat Holdings. Upon closing, management contributed to Serafina Holdings the portion of their equity interests in Intelsat Holdings not purchased for cash by Serafina in exchange for equity interests in Serafina Holdings (which was renamed Intelsat Global, Ltd. (Intelsat Global) on February 8, 2008). In order to finance the New Sponsors Acquisition, Serafina borrowed $4.96 billion in aggregate principal amount of term loans under a $2.81 billion senior unsecured bridge loan credit agreement, dated as of February 4, 2008 (the Senior Bridge Loan Credit Agreement) and a $2.15 billion senior unsecured payment-in-kind election bridge loan credit agreement, dated as of February 4, 2008 (the PIK Election Bridge Loan Credit Agreement and, together with the Senior Bridge Loan Credit Agreement, the Bridge Loan Credit Agreements) (see Note 11Long-Term Debt). Serafina Holdings is an entity newly formed by funds controlled by BC Partners Holdings Limited (BC Partners) and certain other investors (collectively, the BCEC Funds). Subsequent to the execution of the BC Share Purchase Agreement, two investment funds controlled by Silver Lake Partners (Silver Lake) and other equity investors joined the BCEC Funds as the equity sponsors of Serafina Holdings. The BCEC Funds, the Silver Lake funds and the other equity sponsors are referred to as the New Sponsors and the acquisition of Intelsat Holdings, our indirect parent, referred to as the New Sponsors Acquisition. Immediately following the New Sponsors Acquisition, Intelsat Bermuda, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, transferred certain of its assets (including all of its direct and indirect ownership interests in its subsidiaries) and certain of its liabilities and obligations to a newly formed direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Intelsat Jackson Holdings, Ltd (Intelsat Jackson), pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement (the Intelsat Bermuda Transfer). Following the Intelsat Bermuda Transfer, Intelsat Jackson became the owner of substantially all of Intelsat Bermudas assets and the obligor with respect to substantially all of Intelsat Bermudas liabilities and obligations, and Intelsat Bermuda no longer had any rights or obligations with respect to such assets and liabilities. Immediately after the consummation of the Intelsat Bermuda Transfer, Serafina assigned certain of its assets and liabilities to Intelsat Bermuda (the Serafina Assignment), including Serafinas rights and obligations under the Bridge Loan Credit Agreements and a Commitment Letter, dated as of June 19, 2007 among Serafina and certain banks related to the financing of the New Sponsors Acquisition, as F-17 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) amended by the Commitment Letter Amendment, dated as of February 7, 2008 (the Financing Commitment Letter). In addition, our subsidiaries, Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Corp, entered into amendments to their existing credit agreements, and Intelsat Corp entered into a joinder agreement to its existing credit agreement, to facilitate the New Sponsors Acquisition. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, on February 7, 2008, Intelsat Jackson redeemed pursuant to their terms all $260.0 million of its outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and all $600.0 million of its outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2015, and on March 6, 2008, Intelsat, Ltd. redeemed pursuant to their terms all $400.0 million of its outstanding 5 1 /4% Senior Notes due 2008. The New Sponsors Acquisition and the transactions described above are collectively referred to as the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions. Immediately upon the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition, the Intelsat Bermuda and Intelsat Sub Holdco monitoring fee agreements with Apax Partners Worldwide LLP and Apax Partners, L.P., Apollo Management V, L.P., MDP Global Investors Limited, and Permira Advisers LLC (collectively, the Former Sponsors) were terminated. Intelsat Bermuda entered into a new monitoring fee agreement (the 2008 MFA) with BC Partners and Silver Lake Management Company III, L.L.C. (together, the 2008 MFA parties), pursuant to which the 2008 MFA parties provide certain monitoring, advisory and consulting services to Intelsat Bermuda. The New Sponsors Acquisition was accounted for by Intelsat Holdings under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations . As a result, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition. In accordance with Topic 5J of the codified SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins, the purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down and recorded in our consolidated financial statements, which resulted in a new basis of accounting for the successor period beginning after the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition. Determining fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required us to make significant estimates and assumptions. In order to develop estimates of fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we considered the following generally accepted valuation approaches: the cost approach, the income approach and the market approach. Our estimates included assumptions about projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, tax amortization periods, technology royalty rates and technology life cycles, the regulatory and legal environment, and industry and economic trends. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodologies were reasonable, different assumptions could have resulted in different market values. The purchase price allocation was finalized during the period ended December 31, 2008. In connection with the completion of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions, we recorded $313.1 million of transaction costs within restructuring and transaction costs in our consolidated statements of operations during the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008. These costs included $197.2 million of costs associated with the repurchase or cancellation of restricted shares and share-based compensation arrangements (SCAs) of Intelsat Holdings, an advisory service fee of $60.0 million paid to the 2008 MFA parties, and $55.3 million in professional fees. F-18 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Note 4 Fair Value Measurements FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a market-based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and provides for certain required disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels as follows:  Level 1unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;  Level 2quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation; and  Level 3unobservable inputs based upon the reporting entitys internally developed assumptions which market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The following table presents assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2009 Description As of December 31, 2009 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets Marketable securities(1) $ 34,303 $ 34,303 $  $  Undesignated interest rate swaps 15,662  15,662  Total assets $ 49,965 $ 34,303 $ 15,662 $  Liabilities Undesignated interest rate swaps $ 115,512 $  $ 115,512 $  Embedded derivative 14,600   14,600 Redeemable noncontrolling interest(2) 8,884   8,884 Total liabilities $ 138,996 $  $ 115,512 $ 23,484 (1) Marketable securities consist of available-for-sale securities with a cost basis of $27.3 million and other securities whose fair value represents its cost basis. (2) Redeemable noncontrolling interest is classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. F-19 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) The following table presents the activity for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as defined in FASB ASC 820 for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Embedded Derivative Total Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 4,500 $  $ 4,500 Purchases, issuances and settlements  36,040 36,040 Mark to market valuation adjustments 4,754 (21,440 ) (16,686 ) Net Income attributable to noncontrolling interest (370 )  (370 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 8,884 $ 14,600 $ 23,484 In accordance with the Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity topic of the Codification regarding the classification and measurement of redeemable securities, we mark to market the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investment, at each reporting period. We performed a fair value analysis of the noncontrolling interest related to our 74.9% indirect ownership interest in New Dawn as of December 31, 2009, and this resulted in a non-cash increase in the noncontrolling interest of $4.4 million. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, such items are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as if there is evidence of impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, our rights to operate at orbital locations were written down to the estimated fair value of $2.4 billion, from the aggregate carrying value of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2008, due to an impairment identified during the first quarter of 2009. The fair value of the orbital locations was determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs (see Note 10Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). Note 5 Share-Based and Other Compensation Plans (a) 2005 Share Plan (i) Restricted Shares The board of directors of Intelsat Holdings adopted the Intelsat Holdings, Ltd. 2005 Share Incentive Plan (the 2005 Share Plan) with an effective date of January 28, 2005. Of the shares awarded under the 2005 Share Plan, a portion were time vesting shares and a portion were performance shares that were to vest upon meeting certain performance criteria. Due to certain repurchase features in the 2005 Share Plan, the restricted share grants were classified as a liability of Intelsat Holdings. Upon consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition on February 4, 2008, all outstanding performance-based restricted shares and a portion of the time vesting shares under the 2005 Share Plan vested. Vested restricted shares (including time and performance vesting shares) were purchased by the New Sponsors at approximately $400 per share (the per share price specified in the BC Share Purchase Agreement). In connection with the vesting of these awards upon the consummation of the acquisition, we recorded compensation expense of $148.9 million in the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to F-20 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) January 31, 2008. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, each unvested restricted share of Intelsat Holdings was exchanged for approximately four unvested restricted shares of Intelsat Global (see (b) 2008 Share Plan (i) Rollover Shares below). A summary of the changes in Intelsat Holdings non-vested restricted shares during the year ended December 31, 2007 and the period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, is set forth below: Number of Shares Fair Value Restricted shares: Total non-vested restricted shares at December 31, 2006 413,483 $ 2.15 Restricted shares forfeited and repurchased at par value (41,177 ) $ 2.15 Vested (38,161 ) $ 2.15 Total non-vested restricted shares at December 31, 2007 334,145 $ 2.15 Vested (260,720 ) $ 2.15 Total non-vested restricted shares at January 31, 2008 73,425 $ 2.15 (ii) Share-Based Compensation Arrangements During 2006 and 2007, Intelsat Holdings entered into share-based compensation arrangements (SCAs) with selected employees of Intelsat Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries under the 2005 Share Plan, which permitted such employees to purchase Intelsat Holdings common shares. These SCAs vested over time and were subject to continued employment through each applicable vesting date. The vesting of these SCAs was to accelerate in the event of the occurrence of both a change in control and a termination without cause (each as defined in the 2005 Share Plan) of the relevant employee. Any outstanding but unexercised SCAs could be cancelled at any time after termination of employment. Shares issued as a result of the exercise of SCAs could be repurchased at the lesser of fair market value and the exercise price in the event of voluntary termination by the employee and other defined circumstances. Since these repurchase features enabled Intelsat Holdings to recover the shares without transferring any appreciation in value if the employee were to terminate voluntarily, the SCAs were not deemed to be granted under the guidance provided by FASB ASC 718. The repurchase features provided that if an employee were to be terminated without cause or upon death or disability, Intelsat Holdings would have the right for two years to repurchase any vested shares at fair value as determined on the termination date. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, vesting in SCAs issued under the 2005 Share Plan doubled at consummation of the transaction if the awardee was still employed on February 4, 2008. The vested SCAs were cancelled in return for cash in an amount equal to the excess of approximately $400 (the per share price of the transaction) over the exercise price of each share covered. In connection with the vesting and cancellation of these awards, we recorded expense of $47.6 million in the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008. The remaining unvested SCAs were rolled over into new SCAs of Intelsat Global with new repurchase features (see (b) 2008 Share Plan (ii) Rollover Options below). (b) 2008 Share Plan On May 6, 2009, the board of directors of Intelsat Global adopted the amended and restated Intelsat Global, Ltd. 2008 Share Incentive Plan (the 2008 Share Plan). The 2008 Share Plan provides for a variety of equity-based awards with respect to Class A common shares (the F-21 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Class A Shares), and Class B common shares (the Class B Shares and, together with the Class A Shares, the Common Shares), including non-qualified share options, incentive share options (within the meaning of Section 422 of the United States Internal Revenue Service Tax Code), restricted share awards, restricted share unit awards, share appreciation rights, phantom share awards and performance-based awards. A total of 1,689,975 Common Shares may be issued under the 2008 Share Plan; provided, however, that no more than 946,386 Class B Shares may be issued under the 2008 Share Plan. Class A Shares may be issued pursuant to any type of award; however, Class B Shares may only be issued pursuant to restricted share awards. Additionally, 438,827 Class A Shares shall be available for issuance pursuant to the vesting and/or exercise of certain options and restricted share awards previously granted pursuant to the 2005 Share Plan (the Rollover Awards). To the extent that any award, other than the Rollover Awards, terminates, expires, or lapses for any reason, or is settled in cash without delivery of shares (or, in the case of restricted shares, without vesting) to the participant, then any shares subject to the award may be used again for new grants under the 2008 Share Plan. (i) Rollover Shares In connection with the adoption of the 2008 Share Plan, 293,926 Class A Shares previously granted pursuant to the 2005 Share Plan, of which 228,976 Class A Shares had been awarded to certain executive officers (the Rollover Executive Officers) under employment agreements, became subject to new Class A restricted share agreements and the provisions of the 2008 Share Plan. These rollover shares continue to be classified as a liability of Intelsat Global due to certain repurchase features in the 2008 Share Plan and the new Class A restricted share agreements. The rollover shares continued to vest in the same increments and on the same vesting dates as were applicable prior to the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition. During the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded compensation expense of $0.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively, related to the rollover shares. Prior to the adoption of the 2008 Share Plan in May 2009, we calculated compensation expense related to the rollover shares using the provisions of the 2005 Share Plan over the vesting period based on a fair value of $0.54. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we calculated compensation expense based on the fair value of the Class A shares, taking into consideration the repurchase features set forth in the new Class A restricted share agreements. The fair value equaled the fair value of the Class A shares at December 31, 2009 for the rollover shares held by the Rollover Executive Officers and the fair value equaled the fair value of the Class A shares at the date of grant, $100.00 per share, for rollover shares held by all other awardees. Since the rollover shares consisted of shares of our indirect parent, Intelsat Global, compensation costs for vested awards and the cost to repurchase shares were reflected as capital contributions in the form of liabilities assumed by parent in the accompanying statements of shareholders equity (deficit). F-22 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) A summary of the changes in Intelsat Globals rollover shares during the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009 is set forth below: Rollover Executive Officers All Other Awardees Shares Fair Value Shares Fair Value Rollover shares: Non-vested rollover shares outstanding as of February 1, 2008 228,976 $ 0.54 64,950 $ 0.54 Rollover shares forfeited and purchased at par value  $ 0.54 (2,250 ) $ 0.54 Vested (104,947 ) $ 0.54 (27,710 ) $ 0.54 Total non-vested rollover shares at December 31, 2008 124,029 $ 0.54 34,990 $ 0.54 Rollover shares forfeited and purchased at par value  $ 48.74 (12,178 ) $ 48.74 Vested (114,488 ) $ 48.74 (21,136 ) $ 48.74 Total non-vested rollover shares at December 31, 2009 9,541 $ 122.06 1,676 $ 100.00 The non-vested rollover shares had a remaining weighted average vesting period of 1 month as of December 31, 2009. (ii) Rollover Options In connection with the adoption of the 2008 Share Plan, the unvested SCAs of Intelsat Holdings that had been rolled over into SCAs of Intelsat Global became subject to new option agreements and the provisions of the 2008 Share Plan. As a result, the SCAs were no longer subject to the same repurchase features that had applied previously, and the SCAs were deemed a grant of options to purchase Intelsat Global Class A Shares under FASB ASC 718. Holders of these options who terminate employment with Intelsat Global or its subsidiaries will forfeit any unvested options. Additionally, the option agreements have certain repurchase features which provide that if an employee is terminated without cause or upon death or disability, Intelsat Global has the right for two years to repurchase any vested options, and any shares issued upon exercise of vested options, at the fair market value of the shares, less exercise price in the case of options, as determined on the termination date. In the event an employee resigns, Intelsat Global has the right to repurchase any vested options, and any shares issued upon exercise of vested options, at a price equal to the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at resignation and $100.00 per share, less the applicable exercise price of $25.00 per share. During the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 we recognized $3.1 million of compensation expense related to the cancellation of 46,787 rollover options in return for cash during the period. Prior to the adoption of the 2008 Share Plan in May 2009, we calculated compensation expense related to the rollover options under the provisions of the 2005 Share Plan. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $12.1 million as compensation expense related to the rollover options. We recorded compensation expense for F-23 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) these time vesting restricted options over the vesting period based on the intrinsic value at December 31, 2009, taking into consideration the repurchase features set forth in the underlying agreements. The intrinsic value of the rollover options at December 31, 2009 was $75.00 per share. Since the rollover options consisted of options to purchase shares of our indirect parent, Intelsat Global, compensation costs for vested options and the cost to repurchase options were reflected as capital contributions in the form of liabilities assumed by parent in the accompanying statements of shareholders equity (deficit). A summary of the changes in Intelsat Globals rollover options outstanding during the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009 is set forth below: Number of Shares Intrinsic Value Rollover options outstanding as of February 1, 2008 331,853 $  Forfeited (161,751 ) $  Rollover options outstanding at December 31, 2008 170,102 $  Forfeited  $  Rollover options outstanding at December 31, 2009 170,102 $ 75.00 Rollover options exercisable at December 31, 2009 160,569 $ 75.00 (iii) Class B Share Grants In connection with the adoption of the 2008 Share Plan, 900,249 Class B Shares were awarded to employees of Intelsat Global and its subsidiaries. These shares are subject to transfer, vesting and other restrictions set forth in the applicable Class B restricted share agreements, as described below. Class B Share Grants to Certain Executive Officers The 480,830 Class B Shares issued to certain of our executive officers ( the Class B Executive Officers) as of May 6, 2009 are subject to time vesting, generally with 25% of the shares vested as of the date of grant and the remaining shares vesting in equal monthly installments of 1/45 th per month commencing June 4, 2009 (the Executive Officer Class B Time-Vesting Shares). The remaining 75% of the Class B Shares are subject to annual performance-based vesting upon the achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA and revenue goals for 2008 and 2009 (and 2010 for individuals hired after the first quarter of 2008), as defined in the applicable agreements, subject to catch-up vesting upon achievement of targets in later years (the Executive Officer Class B Performance Shares). In the event of a change in control, as defined in the 2008 Share Plan, the Executive Officer Class B Time-Vesting Shares become fully vested, and the Executive Officer Class B Performance Shares vest if certain principal shareholders of Intelsat Global, as defined in the applicable agreements (the Principal Shareholders), receive a three times multiple on their investment (four times if the change in control occurs after February 4, 2015). In the event the Class B Executive Officer dies or becomes disabled, such individuals Executive Officer Class B Time-Vesting Shares become fully vested and F-24 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) such individuals Executive Officer Class B Performance Shares cease vesting and unvested shares are forfeited, unless, within six months following such termination, an initial public offering occurs or Intelsat Global enters into a definitive agreement resulting in a change in control, in which case the unvested shares will be eligible to become vested as if a change in control had occurred immediately prior to termination (the Executive Officer Transaction Vesting Protection). In the event the Class B Executive Officer is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (in either case as defined in the Class B Executive Officers employment agreement) such individuals Executive Officer Transaction Vesting Protection applies to both such individuals Executive Officer Class B Time-Vesting Shares and such individuals Executive Officer Class B Performance Shares, and if such termination occurs after certain service period obligations are met, 50% of such individuals unvested Executive Officer Class B Time-Vesting Shares vest. In the event the Class B Executive Officer breaches any covenants contained in the applicable employment agreements, such individual will be required to repay Intelsat Global for all Class B Shares which vested during the twelve months preceding the breach of the covenant. Class B Share Grants to All Other Awardees 419,419 restricted Class B Shares were issued effective as of May 8, 2009 to certain other members of management and key employees of Intelsat Global and its subsidiaries. Generally, five-sevenths of these Class B Shares are subject to time vesting, with 10% of the shares generally vesting six months after the later of February 4, 2008 or the date of hire, and the remaining shares vesting in equal monthly installments of 1/54 th per month thereafter (the Management Class B Time-Vesting Shares). The remaining Class B Shares are subject to annual performance-based vesting upon the achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA and revenue goals for 2008 and 2009 (and 2010 for individuals hired after the first quarter of 2008), as defined in the applicable agreements, subject to catch-up vesting upon achievement of targets in later years (the Management Class B Performance Shares). In the event of a change in control, as defined in the applicable agreement, the Management Class B Time-Vesting Shares become fully vested, and the Management Class B Performance Shares vest if the Principal Shareholders receive a three times multiple on their investment (four times if the change in control occurs after February 4, 2015). In the event of the termination, death or disability of the holder, the respective Management Class B Time-Vesting Shares and Management Class B Performance Shares cease vesting and all unvested shares are forfeited. In the event of the holders termination of employment without cause, Intelsat Global may repurchase the shares generally for fair market value. If the termination is for cause, as defined in the 2008 Share Plan, the shares may be repurchased at a price per share equal to par value, and if the termination is due to the holders resignation, the repurchase price is defined in the 2008 Share Plan and applicable agreements. Due to certain repurchase features in the 2008 Share Plan and the terms of the applicable restricted share agreements, all restricted Class B Share grants were classified as a liability of Intelsat Global. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded compensation expense of $13.5 million related to these restricted Class B shares. We calculated F-25 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) compensation expense for the Executive Officer Class B Time-Vesting Shares ratably over the vesting period and for the Executive Officer Class B Performance Shares based on the performance-based vesting criteria specified in the applicable agreements. Compensation expense was based on the intrinsic value at December 31, 2009 of $44.44 per share for the Class B Executive Officers (which equaled fair value, based on our estimate, relying in part on a third party valuation) and $10.73 per share for all other awardees, although a different fair market value might apply to the repurchase terms of the awards applicable to an employee termination without cause. Since the Class B Share grants consisted of shares of our indirect parent, Intelsat Global, compensation costs for vested awards and the cost to repurchase shares were reflected as capital contributions in the form of liabilities assumed by parent in the accompanying statements of shareholders equity (deficit). A summary of the changes in Intelsat Globals restricted Class B Shares during the year ended December 31, 2009 is set forth below: Class B Executive Officers All Other Awardees Shares Fair Value Shares Fair Value Non-vested Class B Shares at January 1, 2009  $   $  Class B Shares granted on May 6, 2009 480,830 $ 10.73 419,419 $ 10.73 Vested (177,333 ) $ 10.73 (167,500 ) $ 10.73 Total non-vested Class B Shares at December 31, 2009 303,497 $ 44.44 251,919 $ 10.73 (iv) Class A Share Option Grants and SCAs In connection with the adoption of the 2008 Share Plan, 707,351 Intelsat Global Class A SCAs were awarded to employees of Intelsat Global and its subsidiaries under SCAs at an exercise price of $100 per share (the New 2008 SCAs), and 377,795 Class A Share options were awarded to certain of our executive officers under option agreements at an exercise price of $100 per share. These awards are subject to transfer, vesting and other restrictions set forth in the various agreements, as described below. Class A Share Option Grants to Certain Executive Officers These options will vest with respect to 206,070 Class A Shares based upon the achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA and revenue goals for 2010, 2011 and 2012 (and 2013 for individuals hired after the first quarter of 2008), as defined in the applicable agreements, subject to catch-up vesting upon achievement of targets in later years or if the Principal Shareholders receive a three times multiple on their investment (four times if the change in control occurs after February 4, 2015) in connection with a change in control. Upon the occurrence of a change in control or other realization event for the Principal Shareholders, the options will vest ratably with respect to an additional 171,725 Class A Shares based upon a sliding scale of return on the Principal Shareholders investment from 3.3 times to 4.1 times. The options generally expire on the earliest to occur of: (i) February 4, 2018, (ii) 90 days following resignation without good reason, (iii) one year following termination without cause or for good reason or upon death or disability and (iv) the date of termination for cause. The options are subject to Executive Officer Transaction Vesting Protection following a termination due to death or disability, F-26 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) a termination without cause or a resignation for good reason. Additionally, in the event that the executive officer is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason following certain specified corporate transactions, the option will vest as if a change in control had occurred immediately prior to termination. The Class A Shares acquired upon exercise of the options are subject to repurchase rights similar to the rights specified in the executive officers Class B restricted share agreement. In the event the executive officer breaches any covenants contained in the executive officers employment agreement, such individual will be required to repay Intelsat Global an amount equal to the number of shares acquired pursuant to the option during the twelve months preceding the breach of the covenants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of the shares over the exercise price paid. These awards were deemed a grant of options to purchase Intelsat Global common shares under the guidance provided by FASB ASC 718. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded compensation expense of $0.5 million related to these Class A options. We calculated compensation expense for the Class A options based on the performance-based vesting criteria specified in the applicable agreements, the meeting of certain of the goals of which we have deemed to be probable as of December 31, 2009. Compensation expense was based on the intrinsic value at December 31, 2009 of $22.06 per share. Class A SCAs for All Other Employees Approximately 55% of the shares subject to the New 2008 SCAs will vest based upon the achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA and revenue goals for 2010, 2011 and 2012 (and 2013 for individuals hired after the first quarter of 2008), as defined in the applicable agreements, subject to catch-up vesting in certain circumstances, including upon achievement of targets in later years or if the Principal Shareholders receive a three times multiple on their investment (four times if the change in control occurs after February 4, 2015) in connection with a change in control, as defined. Approximately 45% of the shares subject to the New 2008 SCAs will vest upon the occurrence of a change in control or other realization event based upon a sliding scale of return on the Principal Shareholders investment from 3.3 times to 4.1 times. The New 2008 SCAs generally expire on the earliest to occur of: (i) February 4, 2018, (ii) 90 days following termination of employment, other than as a result of death or disability, (iii) one year following termination upon death or disability and (iv) the date of termination for cause. Class A Shares acquired upon exercise of the New 2008 SCAs are subject to repurchase rights of Intelsat Global similar to the rights specified in the agreements governing the restricted Class B Share grants. The New 2008 SCAs also contain restrictive covenants similar to those contained in the agreements governing the restricted Class B Share grants. Any Class A Shares held by employees as a result of the exercise of the New 2008 SCAs can be repurchased at the lesser of fair market value and the exercise price in the event of voluntary termination by the employee and other defined circumstances. Since these repurchase features enable Intelsat Global to recover the shares without transferring any appreciation in value if the employee were to terminate voluntarily, the New 2008 SCAs were not deemed to be granted. The repurchase features provide that if an employee were to be terminated without cause or upon death or disability, Intelsat Global would have the right for two years to repurchase any vested shares issued upon exercise of the New 2008 SCAs at fair value as determined on the termination date. F-27 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Note 6 Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits (a) Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan covering certain of our employees. The cost of providing benefits to eligible participants under the defined benefit retirement plan is calculated using the plans benefit formulas, which take into account the participants remuneration, dates of hire, years of eligible service, and certain actuarial assumptions. In addition, as part of the overall medical plan, we provide postretirement medical benefits to certain current retirees who meet the criteria under the medical plan for postretirement benefit eligibility. The defined benefit retirement plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. We expect that our future contributions to the defined benefit retirement plan will be based on the minimum funding requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and on the plans funded status. Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks related to the short-term liquidity of certain investments held by our defined benefit plan, which could impact the value of the plan assets after the date of these consolidated financial statements. Additionally, any significant decline in the fair value of our defined benefit retirement plan assets could affect its funded status. The impact on the funded status as of October 1, the plans annual measurement date, is determined based upon market conditions in effect when we completed our annual valuation. Based on these criteria, we were not required to make additional contributions in 2009 to the defined benefit retirement plan, however we currently expect that we will be required to make additional contributions in 2010 of approximately $9.6 million under our defined benefit retirement plan and $4.0 million related to the funding of postretirement medical benefits under our medical plan. We adopted the provision of FASB ASC Topic 715, CompensationRetirement Benefits (FASB ASC 715) , to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. Effective December 31, 2008, FASB ASC 715 requires an employer to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end. We previously performed this measurement at September 30 of each year. On January 1, 2008, we adopted the measurement date provision under the alternative transition method, utilizing a 15-month model for transition. Accordingly, we used our September 30, 2007 valuation to project 15 months of net periodic benefit cost and recognized three-fifteenths, or $0.4 million (net of tax), of such costs as an adjustment to accumulated deficit in January 2008. F-28 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Reconciliation of Funded Status and Accumulated Benefit Obligation. Expenses for our defined benefit retirement plan and for postretirement medical benefits that are provided under our medical plan are developed from actuarial valuations.

Using this bond universe, regression analysis is used to identify the best-fitting regression curve that links yield-to-maturity providing match to data for both long and short maturities. The resulting regressed coupon yield curve is smoothly continuous along its entire length and represents an unbiased average of the observed market data and takes into account all information for both a single maturity and across all maturities. Interest rates used in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates used in determining the present value of future benefit payments and expected return on plan assets, which are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. The discount rates reflect market rates for high-quality corporate bonds. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making assumptions. In establishing the expected return on assets assumption, we review the asset allocations considering plan maturity and develop return assumptions based on different asset classes. The return assumptions are established after reviewing historical returns of broader market indexes, as well as historical performance of the investments in the plan. Our pension plan assets are managed in accordance with an investment policy adopted by the pension committee, as discussed below. Plan Assets. The investment policy of the Plan includes target allocation percentages of approximately 65% for investments in equity securities (49% U.S. equities and 16% non-U.S. equities) and 35% for investments in fixed income securities. There are restrictions on investment managers to prevent the concentration of investments in the securities of any one company or industry, the purchase of tax-exempt securities, direct investments in commodities and short sales and to impose other restrictions. Plan assets include investments in equity and bond funds, U.S. government securities funds and liquid reserve funds. The mutual funds in which the plans assets are invested are institutionally managed mutual funds with diversified exposures into multiple asset classes implemented with over 40 investment managers. The guidelines and objectives of the funds are congruent with the Intelsat investment policy statement. F-30 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A.

F-32 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Depending upon our actual future health care claims, our actual costs may vary significantly from those projected above. As of both December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 the assumed health care cost trend rate of 9.0%. This rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% by the year 2017 and to remain at that level of annual increase thereafter. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% each year would increase the other postretirement benefits obligation as of December 31, 2009 by $8.8 million. Decreasing this trend rate by 1% each year would reduce the other postretirement benefits obligation as of December 31, 2009 by $7.5 million. A 1% increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased or decreased the net periodic other postretirement benefits cost for 2009 by $0.5 million.

Included in satellites and launch vehicles is a satellite under capital lease, which at December 31, 2008 had a net book value of $2.8 million and was fully depreciated as of December 31, 2009. Carrying amounts as of December 31, 2009 reflect the fair value adjustments recorded in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition (see Note 3New Sponsors Acquisition). We have entered into launch contracts for the launch of both specified and unspecified future satellites. Each of these launch contracts provides that such contract may be terminated at our option, subject to payment of a termination fee that increases in magnitude as the applicable launch date approaches. In addition, in the event of a failure of any launch, we may exercise our right to obtain a replacement launch within a specified period following our request for re-launch. In August 2009, we purchased from Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. its Amos-1 satellite, which is currently in inclined orbit, plus related ground assets. The satellite, with nine Ku-band transponders, had an estimated remaining useful life of 4.0 years at closing, and was purchased together with ground assets for $14.0 million, of which $7.0 million was paid at closing. As of December 31, 2009, the remaining $7.0 million was payable over the next two years. This satellite, which we renamed IS-24, began providing service in November 2009. F-34 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) On October 29, 2009, we were selected as the successful bidder at a bankruptcy auction for the Protostar I satellite with an all cash offer of $210.0 million. The purchase of the satellite and related ground assets closed in December 2009. The satellite, with 16 Ku-band transponders, has an estimated remaining useful life of 15.5 years. This satellite, which was renamed IS-25, is expected to begin providing service in April 2010. In December 2009, we purchased from SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation its JCSAT-R satellite, which is currently in inclined orbit, plus related ground assets. The satellite, with 28 Ku-band transponders and 12 C-band transponders, had an estimated remaining useful life of 5.0 years at closing, and was purchased together with ground assets for $5.0 million, of which $0.5 million was paid at closing. The remaining $4.5 million was paid in January 2010. This satellite, which was renamed IS-26, is expected to begin providing service in June 2010. (b) Satellite Launches On November 23, 2009, we successfully launched IS-14 satellite into orbit. This satellite replaces Intelsat 1R at 315º east longitude and serves programmers, government and corporate broadband customers in Latin America, Europe, and Africa. This satellite entered into service during December 2009. On November 30, 2009, we successfully launched IS-15 satellite into orbit. This satellite replaces Intelsat 709 at 85º east longitude and serves programmers, government and corporate broadband customers in the Middle East, Indian Ocean region, and Russia. This satellite is expected to begin providing service in January 2010. (c) Satellite Health Our satellite fleet is diversified by manufacturer and satellite type, and as a result, our fleet is generally healthy. We have experienced some technical problems with our current fleet but have been able to minimize the impact of these problems on our customers, our operations and our business in recent years. Many of these problems have been component failures and anomalies that have had little long-term impact to date on the overall transponder availability in our satellite fleet. All of our satellites have been designed to accommodate an anticipated rate of equipment failures with adequate redundancy to meet or exceed their orbital design lives, and to date, this redundancy design scheme has proven effective. After each anomaly we have generally restored services for our customers on the affected satellite, provided alternative capacity on other satellites in our fleet, or provided capacity that we purchased from other satellite operators. Significant Anomalies On November 28, 2004, our Galaxy 27 satellite experienced a sudden anomaly in its north electrical distribution system which resulted in the loss of control of the satellite and the interruption of customer services on the satellite. Galaxy 27 is a FS 1300 series satellite manufactured by SS/L. Our engineers were able to regain command and control of Galaxy 27, and it was placed back in service, with reduced payload capacity, following operational testing. We have determined that the north electrical distribution system on Galaxy 27 and the communications capacity associated with it are not operational, and the satellite has lost F-35 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) redundancy in nearly all of its components. As a result, Galaxy 27 faces an increased risk of loss in the future. As of December 31, 2009, a substantial subset of Galaxy 27s transponders, which are all powered by the south electrical distribution system, have been tested, are performing normally and are available for service to our customers. Some of these transponders are currently being used by our customers. On January 14, 2005, our IS-804 satellite experienced a sudden and unexpected electrical power system anomaly that resulted in the total loss of the satellite. IS-804 was a Lockheed Martin 7000 series (the LM 7000 series) satellite, and as of December 31, 2009 we operated three other satellites in the LM 7000 series, IS-801, IS-802 and IS-805. Of these three satellites, only IS-805 remains in a primary role. Based on the report of the failure review board that we established with Lockheed Martin Corporation, we believe that the IS-804 failure was not likely to have been caused by an IS-804 specific workmanship or hardware element, but was most likely caused by a high current event in the battery circuitry triggered by an electrostatic discharge that propagated to cause the sudden failure of the high voltage power system. We therefore believe that although this risk exists for our other LM 7000 series satellites, the risk of any individual satellite having a similar anomaly is low. On September 21, 2006, our IS-802 satellite experienced a reduction of electrical power capability that resulted in a degraded capability of the satellite. Eleven transponders on IS-802 were subsequently reactivated and are operating normally. The anomaly review board that we established with Lockheed Martin Corporation to investigate the cause of the anomaly concluded that the IS-802 anomaly was most likely to have been caused by an electrical short internal to the solar array harness located on the south solar array boom. The anomaly review board found that this anomaly was significantly different from previous LM 7000 series spacecraft failures and was the first failure of this type on a solar array of the LM 7000 series. We therefore believe that, although this risk exists for our other LM 7000 series satellites, the risk of any individual satellite having a similar anomaly is low. On June 29, 2008, our Galaxy 26 satellite experienced a sudden and unexpected electrical distribution anomaly causing the loss of a substantial portion of the satellite power generating capability and resulting in the interruption of some of the customer services on the satellite. Galaxy 26 is also a FS 1300 series satellite. Certain transponders continue to operate normally. However, the anomaly resulted in a reduction to the estimated remaining useful life of the satellite. With respect to both the Galaxy 27 and Galaxy 26 anomalies, the failure review boards that we established with SS/L identified the likely root cause of the anomalies as a design flaw which is affected by a number of parameters and in some extreme cases can result in an electrical system anomaly. The design flaw also exists on IS-8. This satellite has been in service since November 1998 and has not experienced an electrical system anomaly. Along with the manufacturer, we continually monitor this problem and we have ordered a replacement for IS-8 expected to be launched in late 2012. F-36 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Other Anomalies We have also identified three other types of common anomalies among the satellite models in our fleet, which have had an operational impact in the past and could, if they materialize, have an impact in the future. These are:  failure of the on-board spacecraft control processor (SCP) in Boeing 601 (BSS 601) satellites; and  failure of the on-board XIPS used to maintain the in-orbit position of Boeing 601 High Power Series (BSS 601 HP) satellites; and  accelerated solar array degradation in early Boeing 702 (BSS 702) satellites. SCP Failures. Many of our satellites use an on-board SCP to provide automatic on-board control of many operational functions. SCPs are a critical component in the operation of such satellites. Each such satellite has a backup SCP, which is available in the event of a failure of the primary SCP. Certain BSS 601 satellites have experienced SCP failures. The risk of SCP failure appears to decline as these satellites age. As of December 31, 2009, we operated five BSS 601 satellites: HGS-3, which is utilized by a third-party, IS-2, IS-3R, IS-4, which had previously experienced primary SCP failure and was operating on its backup SCP, and IS-26. These satellites have been identified as having heightened susceptibility to the SCP problem. On February 1, 2010, the backup SCP on IS-4 failed, resulting in a loss of the spacecraft. IS-4 carried commercial traffic and operated in a secondary role. Its failure did not cause a significant interruption of our business or require replacement of a satellite. IS-2, IS-3R and IS-26 have been in continuous operation since 1994, 1996 and 1997, respectively. Both primary and backup SCPs on these satellites are monitored regularly and remain fully functional. Accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that additional SCP failures will occur and we do not anticipate an interruption in business or early replacement of these satellites. BSS 601 HP XIPS. The BSS 601 HP satellite uses XIPS as its primary propulsion system. There are two separate XIPS on each BSS 601 HP, each one of which is capable of maintaining the satellite in its orbital position. The satellite also has a completely independent bi-propellant propulsion system as a backup to the XIPS. As a result, the failure of a XIPS on a BSS 601 HP typically would have no effect on the satellites performance or its operating life. However, the failure of both XIPS would require the use of the backup bi-propellant propulsion system, which could result in a shorter operating life for the satellite depending on the amount of bi-propellant fuel remaining. XIPS failures do not typically result in a catastrophic failure of the satellite or affect the communications capability of the satellite. As of December 31, 2009, we operated four BSS 601 HP satellites, IS-5, IS-9, 1S-10 and Galaxy 13/Horizons-1. IS-5 and Galaxy 13/Horizons-1 continue to have both XIPS available as their primary propulsion system. IS-9 and IS-10 have experienced the failure of both XIPS and are operating on their backup bi-propellant systems. These two satellites are expected to be replaced by 2012. Our BSS 601 HP satellites have available bi-propellant fuel for a range of approximately two and a half to eight years from December 31, 2009. No assurance can be given that we will not have further XIPS failures that result in shortened satellite lives. We have decommissioned three satellites that had experienced failure of both XIPS. IS-6B was replaced by IS-11 during the first quarter of 2008, Galaxy 10R was replaced by Galaxy 18 during the second quarter of 2008, and Galaxy 4R was decommissioned in March 2009. F-37 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) BSS 702 Solar Arrays. All of our satellites have solar arrays that power their operating systems and transponders and recharge the batteries used when solar power is not available. Solar array performance typically degrades over time in a predictable manner. Additional power margins and other operational flexibility are designed into satellites to allow for such degradation without loss of performance or operating life. Certain BSS 702 satellites have experienced greater than anticipated degradation of their solar arrays resulting from the design of the solar arrays. Such degradation, if continued, results in a shortened operating life of a satellite or the need to reduce the use of the communications payload. As of December 31, 2009, we operated three BSS 702 satellites, two of which are affected by accelerated solar array degradation, Galaxy 11 and IS-1R. Service to customers has not been affected, and we expect that both of these satellites will continue to serve customers until we replace or supplement them with new satellites. Along with the manufacturer, we continually monitor the problem to determine its cause and its expected effect. Due to this continued degradation, Galaxy 11s estimated end of service life is April 2015 and IS-1Rs estimated end of service life is February 2016. Both satellites are currently operating in secondary roles. The third BSS 702 satellite that we operated as of December 31, 2009, Galaxy 3C, was launched after the solar array anomaly was identified, and it has a substantially different solar array design intended to eliminate the problem. This satellite has been in service since September 2002 and has not experienced similar degradation problems. Note 9 Investments (a) WildBlue Communications, Inc. Prior to December 15, 2009 we had an ownership interest of approximately 28% in WildBlue Communications, Inc. (WildBlue), a company offering broadband Internet access services in the continental United States via Ka-band satellite capacity. We accounted for our investment using the equity method of accounting. Because of a history of operating and on-going losses at WildBlue, the investment was determined to have a new basis of zero in connection with the allocation of the purchase price from the New Sponsors Acquisition at February 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, our cumulative losses exceeded the investment, and as a result, the investment balance remained at zero and no additional losses from WildBlue were recognized. On December 15, 2009, we sold our ownership interest in WildBlue to Viasat Inc. through a non-cash transaction whereby we exchanged our interest in WildBlue for shares of Viasat Inc. common stock. A gain on the sale was recorded within our consolidated statement of operations for $27.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. (b) Horizons-1 and Horizons-2 As a result of our acquisition of PanAmSat Holdco and its subsidiaries on July 3, 2006 and related transactions (the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions), we have a joint venture with JSAT International, Inc. (JSAT), a leading satellite operator in the Asia-Pacific region. The joint venture is named Horizons Satellite Holdings, LLC, and consists of two investments: Horizons-1 Satellite LLC (Horizons-1) and Horizons-2 Satellite LLC (Horizons-2). We provide certain services to the joint venture and utilize capacity from the joint venture. F-38 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Horizons-1 owns and operates the Ku-band portion of the Horizons-1 satellite in the fixed satellite services sector, offering service to customers in the Asia-Pacific region. We have a 50% ownership interest in Horizons-1, an investment which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our share of the results of Horizons-1 is included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and was income of $0.2 million, $0.02 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the predecessor year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. The investment balance of $15.7 million and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, was included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During the predecessor year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded expenses of $3.9 million, $0.3 million, $3.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in relation to the utilization of Ku-band satellite capacity from Horizons-1. Additionally, we provide TT&C and administrative services for the Horizons-1 satellite. We recorded revenue for these services of $0.6 million, $0.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million during the predecessor year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. We also have a revenue share agreement with JSAT related to services sold on the Horizons-1 satellite. We are responsible for the billing and collecting for all such services sold, but recognize revenue on a net basis. As a result of this agreement, we reduced revenue by $14.8 million, $1.1 million, $14.0 million and $14.9 million for the predecessor year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. The payable due to JSAT was $2.0 million and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. On August 1, 2005, Intelsat Corp formed a second satellite joint investment with JSAT to build and launch a Ku-band satellite, Horizons2. The Horizons-2 satellite was launched in December 2007 and placed into service in February 2008. Our investment is being accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The total future joint investment in Horizons-2 is expected to be $130.4 million as of December 31, 2009, of which each of the joint venture partners is required to fund their 50% share. Our share of the results of Horizons-2 is included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and was income of $0.3 million for the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, the investment balance of $79.2 million and $75.3 million, respectively, and was included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, there was no adjustment to the investment balance or the corresponding liability balance (see Note 3New Sponsors Acquisition). In connection with our investment in Horizons-2, we entered into a capital contribution and subscription agreement in August 2005, which requires us to fund our 50% share of the amounts due under Horizons-2s loan agreement with a third-party lender. Pursuant to this agreement, we made contributions of $9.7 million and $12.2 million as of December 31, 2008 F-39 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) and 2009, respectively. We have entered into a security and pledge agreement with a third-party lender and, pursuant to this agreement, granted a security interest in our contribution obligation to the lender. Therefore, we have recorded this obligation as an indirect guarantee. We recorded a liability of $12.2 million within accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and a liability of $61.0 million and $48.8 million within other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We provide TT&C and administrative services for the Horizons-2 satellite. We did not receive any revenue for these services during the predecessor year ended December 31, 2007 or the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008. We recorded revenue for these services of $0.7 million and $0.8 million during the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. During the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded expenses of $6.9 million and $7.1 million, respectively, in relation to the utilization of satellite capacity for the Horizons-2 satellite. We also have a revenue share agreement with JSAT related to services sold on the Horizons-2 satellite. We are responsible for the billing and collecting for all such services sold, but recognize revenue on a net basis. As a result of this agreement, we reduced revenue by $6.8 million and $9.7 million for the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. The amount payable to JSAT was $2.2 million and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. (c) New Dawn In June 2008, we entered into a project and shareholders agreement (the New Dawn Project Agreement) with Convergence Partners pursuant to which New Dawn Satellite Company Ltd., a Mauritius company in which we have a 74.9% indirect ownership interest and Convergence Partners has a 25.1% noncontrolling ownership interest, intends to procure and launch a new satellite to provide satellite transponder services to customers in Africa. We currently expect the satellite to be launched during the fourth quarter of 2010. New Dawn entered into a secured loan financing arrangement, which is non-recourse to New Dawns shareholders, including us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, beyond the shareholders scheduled capital contributions, on December 5, 2008 to obtain $215.0 million of financing to fund a portion of the cost of construction and launch of the new satellite (see Note 11Long-Term Debt). In addition, we and Convergence Partners have agreed to make certain capital contributions to New Dawn in proportion to our respective ownership interests in New Dawn to fund a portion of these costs. Out of the total equity contributions of $18.3 million in 2008, our initial capital contributions were $13.7 million and Convergence Partners contributions were $4.6 million. Total equity contributions during 2009 were $1.5 million, of which $1.1 million were attributable to Intelsat with the remaining $0.4 million contributed by Convergence Partners. New Dawn and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries for purposes of applicable indentures and credit agreements of Intelsat and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. We have agreed to provide sales and marketing services, engineering and administrative support services, and have agreed to perform satellite-related consulting and technical services for New Dawn. The services include the provision of program management services with respect to the satellite and launch vehicle construction programs as well as TT&C F-40 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) services for the new satellite. In addition, for a fee of $15.0 million together with assumption of continuing payment obligations, we assigned New Dawn a launch service contract to provide for the launch of the New Dawn satellite. Convergence Partners has at its option the ability to require Intelsat to buy its ownership interest at fair value subsequent to the operations of New Dawns assets for a period as defined in the New Dawn Project Agreement. As a result of this option, as of each balance sheet date, we have reflected within mezzanine equity the estimated amount that we would pay to Convergence Partners as if the option was exercised. This amount reflects the fair value analysis we performed at December 31, 2009, which resulted in a $4.4 million increase in the fair value. The $4.4 million change in fair value is shown as a reduction in our paid-in capital at December 31, 2009. We have assessed the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the overall valuation and have concluded that the valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 2Significant Accounting Policies). As of December 31, 2009, we consolidated New Dawn within our consolidated financial statements, net of eliminating entries. Additionally, we accounted for the percentage interest in New Dawn owned by Convergence Partners as a noncontrolling interest. We recorded the transaction in accordance with the guidance provided under the Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity topic of the Codification specifically related to the classification and measurement of redeemable securities during the first quarter of 2009. Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The carrying amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets not subject to amortization consist of the following (in thousands): As of December 31, 2008 As of December 31, 2009 Goodwill $ 6,774,334 $ 6,780,827 Trade name 70,400 70,400 Orbital locations 2,886,800 2,387,700 We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with FASB ASC 350 and have deemed these assets to have indefinite lives. Under FASB ASC 350, we perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The following is a discussion of our impairment analysis and methodology: Goodwill . We follow a two-step process to evaluate if a potential impairment exists to our recorded amounts of goodwill and tradename. The first step of the process is to compare the reporting units fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. In the event the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and the second step is required. The second step requires us to calculate a hypothetical purchase allocation to compare the current implied fair value of the goodwill to the current carrying value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles, as F-41 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) if they were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill as described above exceeds recorded goodwill, there is no impairment. If the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess. Furthermore, an impairment loss cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. After recognizing the impairment loss, the corresponding loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting standards. We determined the estimated fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis, along with independent source data related to comparative market multiples and, when available, recent transactions which are all considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC 820. The discounted cash flows were derived from a five-year projection of revenues and expenses plus a residual value, with the resulting projected cash flows discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. The analysis, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009, did not result in an impairment of our goodwill intangible. Trade name . We have implemented the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of the Intelsat trade name. The relief from royalty analysis is comprised of two major steps: i) a determination of the hypothetical royalty rate, and ii) the subsequent application of the royalty rate to projected revenue. In determining the hypothetical royalty rate utilized in the relief from royalty approach, we considered comparable license agreements, operating earnings benchmark rule of thumb, an excess earnings analysis to determine aggregate intangible asset earnings, and other qualitative factors which are all considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC 820. Based on our analysis, the fair value of the Intelsat trade name as of the fourth quarter of 2009 was not impaired. Orbital Locations. We are authorized by governments to operate satellites at certain orbital locations  i.e., longitudinal coordinates along the Clarke Belt. The Clarke Belt is the part of space approximately 42,165 kilometers above the plane of the equator where geostationary orbit may be achieved. Various governments acquire rights to these orbital locations through filings made with the International Telecommunication Union (the ITU), a sub-organization of the United Nations. We will continue to have rights to operate at our orbital locations so long as we maintain our authorizations to do so. We determined the estimated fair value of our right to operate at orbital locations using the build up method to determine the cash flows for the income approach, with the resulting projected cash flows discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. In instances where the build up method did not generate positive value for the right to operate at an orbital location, but the right was expected to generate revenue, we assigned a value based upon independent source data for recent transactions of similar orbital locations which are all considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC 820. The analysis, which was completed in the fourth quarter 2008, led to the recording of a non-cash impairment charge of $326.8 million. During the first quarter of 2009, the credit markets continued to experience difficulties, with new debt issuances being priced at significantly higher effective interest rates as compared to the pricing of debt issuances completed in prior periods. The higher effective interest rates F-42 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) reflected, in our view, higher discounts being applied in the valuation of companies generally, and were therefore considered by us to be an indicator of potential impairment to the fair value of our right to operate at orbital locations. The higher interest rates resulted in an increase to our weighted average cost of capital, and led to our recognizing a non-cash impairment charge of $499.1 million in the first quarter of 2009. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following (in thousands): As of December 31, 2008 As of December 31, 2009 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Backlog and other $ 743,760 $ (146,745 ) $ 597,015 $ 743,760 $ (270,905 ) $ 472,855 Customer relationships 534,030 (8,266 ) 525,764 534,030 (28,366 ) 505,664 Technology 2,700 (1,204 ) 1,496 2,700 (2,620 ) 80 Total $ 1,280,490 $ (156,215 ) $ 1,124,275 $ 1,280,490 $ (301,891 ) $ 978,599 Intangible assets are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption. As of December 31, 2009, backlog and other, customer relationships and technology had weighted-average useful lives of four years, thirteen years and two years, respectively. We recorded amortization expense of $93.5 million, $7.8 million, $156.2 million and $145.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. Scheduled amortization charges for the intangible assets over the next five years are as follows (in thousands): Year Amount 2010 $ 130,281 2011 105,451 2012 91,781 2013 82,311 2014 68,231 In the first quarter of 2009, the FASB revised FASB ASC 350 to provide additional guidance for determining the useful life of intangible assets.

F-50 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Interest is payable on the 2015 Senior Notes semi-annually on January 15 and July 15. Intelsat Sub Holdco may redeem some or all of the 8 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2015 at any time prior to January 15, 2010, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the make-whole premium described in the respective notes.

The 2015 Senior Notes are guaranteed by Intelsat S.A., Intelsat Luxembourg, Intelsat Jackson, Intermediate Holdco and certain subsidiaries of Intelsat Sub Holdco. At the date of issuance of the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes, we determined that these debt instruments contained a contingent put option clause within the host contract, which affords the holders of the notes the option to require the issuer to repurchase such notes at 101% of their principal amount in the event of a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the notes. In our evaluation of the financing arrangement, we concluded that the contingent put option required bifurcation in accordance with current accounting standards under FASB ASC 815. We were therefore required to bifurcate the contingent put option and carry it as a derivative liability at fair value. We estimated the fair value of the derivative on the date of inception using a standard valuation technique, which places the most significant emphasis upon the estimated date and probability of a change of control and incorporates the issue price, maturity date and change of control put price. The fair value of the embedded derivative was calculated at $36.0 million upon inception and $14.6 million at December 31, 2009. The allocation of a portion of the proceeds from the debt issuance to the fair value of the embedded derivative resulted in an additional discount to the carrying value of the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes. The additional discount will be amortized in the consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest method over the term of the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes. Additionally, the embedded derivative will be adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period with any change in fair value recognized through earnings (see Note 12Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesPut Option Embedded Derivative Instrument). Senior Secured Credit Facilities On January 25, 2008, Intelsat Sub Holdco entered into Amendment No. 2 to its amended and restated credit agreement (the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement), which became effective upon the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition and amended and modified the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement. The senior secured credit facilities as amended to date consist of:  a $344.8 million senior secured term loan facility with a seven-year maturity;  a $270.8 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a six-year maturity; and  a $50.0 million incremental revolving credit facility provision. The revolving credit facility is available on a revolving basis and terminates on July 3, 2012. $200.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans. Both the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any swingline loans will reduce availability under the revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis. F-51 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Following an amendment on January 25, 2008, interest rates for the term loan portion of the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement range, at the option of Intelsat Sub Holdco, (i) from the LIBOR rate plus 1.75% to the LIBOR rate plus 2.00%, or (ii) the ABR, which is the rate for any day (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1.00%) equal to the greater of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day or (b) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1.00%, as defined in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement, plus 0.75%, to the ABR plus 1.00%, depending on certain financial measures. Interest rates for the revolving credit facility portion of the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement range, at the option of Intelsat Sub Holdco, (i) from LIBOR plus 2.00% to LIBOR plus 2.50% or (ii) the ABR plus 1.00% to the ABR plus 1.50%, depending on certain financial measures. The ABR and LIBOR, plus the applicable margins, are determined as specified in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement, as amended. Intelsat Sub Holdco is required to pay a commitment fee for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility, if any, at a rate per annum of 3 / 8 %. Both the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any swingline loans reduce availability under the revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis. Obligations under the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of Intelsat Sub Holdcos subsidiaries, as well as by Intelsat Luxembourg, Intelsat Jackson and Intermediate Holdco, and secured by a perfected first priority security interest to the extent legally permissible in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and guarantors, with certain agreed exceptions. No amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2009; however, $22.9 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the facility. The borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was $247.9 million at such date. Under the terms of the credit agreements governing both Intelsat Sub Holdcos senior secured credit facilities and Intelsat Corps amended and restated senior credit facilities, the ability of each company to borrow under its respective revolving credit facility is subject to compliance by each companys indirect parent, Intelsat S.A., under a senior secured debt covenant included in the indenture governing the 2012 Senior Notes and the 2013 Senior Notes. As a result, under certain circumstances, Intelsat Sub Holdco may not be able to borrow up to the full amount of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility if Intelsat Corp has certain amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility, and Intelsat Corp may not be able to borrow up to the full amount of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility if Intelsat Sub Holdco has certain amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The credit agreement governing Intelsat Sub Holdcos senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing all our outstanding notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. The senior secured credit facilities also include a financial covenant that requires the borrower to maintain compliance with a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Sub Holdco Credit Agreement) of less than or equal to 1.5 to 1.0. We were in compliance with this financial maintenance covenant ratio with a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio of 0.02:1.00 as of December 31, 2009. In addition, the senior secured credit facilities require that the borrower use a portion of the proceeds of certain asset sales, in excess of specified amounts, that are not reinvested in the business, to repay indebtedness under such facilities. The credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the outstanding notes also include covenants (subject to a number of qualifications) restricting, among other things, our ability and certain of our subsidiaries ability to pay F-52 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) dividends, or make redemptions, repurchases or distributions with respect to capital stock; make certain loans or investments; engage in mergers, acquisitions, asset sales and sale and lease-back transactions; and engage in transactions with affiliates. (f) Intelsat New Dawn New Dawn Credit Facilities On December 5, 2008, New Dawn entered into a $215.0 million secured financing arrangement that consists of a senior and mezzanine term loan facilities. The credit facilities are non-recourse to New Dawns shareholders, including us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, beyond the shareholders scheduled capital contributions. The senior facility provides for a commitment of up to $125.0 million. The interest rate on term loans under the senior facility is the aggregate of the LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 3.0% and 4.0% and certain costs, if incurred. The mezzanine facility provides for a commitment of up to $90.0 million. The interest rate on term loans under the mezzanine facility is the aggregate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 5.3% and 6.3% and certain costs, if incurred. New Dawn is required to pay a commitment fee at a rate per annum of 1 / 2 % on any unused commitments under the credit facilities. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, New Dawn incurred satellite related capital expenditures of $97.9 million. (g) Intelsat Corp Senior Secured Credit Facilities On January 25, 2008, Intelsat Corp entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which became effective upon the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition. On February 4, 2008, in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition, Intelsat Corp also executed a Joinder Agreement by and among Intelsat Corp, the several lenders party thereto and certain other parties, to the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement pursuant to which it incurred an additional $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Tranche B-2 Term Loan. Intelsat Corporations senior secured credit facilities consist of:  a $355.9 million senior secured Term Loan A-3 Facility with a six-year maturity;  a $1,785.1 million senior secured Term Loan B-2 Facility with a seven and one half-year maturity;  a $175.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a six-year maturity; and  a $75.0 million incremental revolving credit facility provision. The revolving credit facility is available on a revolving basis and terminates on July 3, 2012. $150.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, a portion of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans. Both the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any swingline loans will reduce availability under the revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis. Following the amendment on January 25, 2008, interest rates for the term loan portion of the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement range, at the option of Intelsat Corp, (i) from LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 2.50% or (ii) the ABR plus 0.75% to the ABR plus 1.50%, depending on certain F-53 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) financial measures. Interest rates for the revolving credit facility portion of the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement range, at the option of Intelsat Corp, (i) from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 2.875% or (ii) the ABR plus 1.50% to the ABR plus 1.875%, depending on certain financial measures. The ABR and LIBOR, plus the applicable margins, are determined as specified in the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended. Intelsat Corp is required to pay a commitment fee for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility, if any, at a rate per annum of 0.375%. Certain of the collateral pledged to secure Intelsat Corps obligations under its senior secured credit facilities is shared with the holders of Intelsat Corps $125.0 million 6 7 / 8 % Senior Secured Debentures due 2028. No amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2009; however, $2.1 million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the facility. The borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was $152.2 million at December 31, 2009. Under the terms of the credit agreements governing both Intelsat Sub Holdcos senior secured credit facilities and Intelsat Corps amended and restated senior credit facilities, the ability of each company to borrow under its respective revolving credit facility is subject to compliance by each companys indirect parent, Intelsat S.A., under a senior secured debt covenant included in the indenture governing Intelsat S.A.s outstanding senior notes. As a result, under certain circumstances, Intelsat Corp may not be able to borrow up to the full amount of borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility if Intelsat Sub Holdco has certain amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The credit agreement governing the Intelsat Corp senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes described below contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. The senior secured credit facilities also include a financial covenant that requires the borrower to maintain a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Intelsat Corp Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of less than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0. We were in compliance with this financial maintenance covenant ratio, with a Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio of 2.57:1.00, as of December 31, 2009. In addition, the senior secured credit facilities require that the borrower use a portion of the proceeds of certain asset sales, in excess of specified amounts, that are not reinvested in the business, to repay indebtedness under such facilities. The credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the outstanding notes also include covenants (subject to a number of qualifications) restricting, among other things, our ability and certain of our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends, or make redemptions, repurchases or distributions with respect to capital stock; make certain loans or investments; engage in mergers, acquisitions, asset sales and sale and lease-back transactions; and engage in transactions with affiliates. 9 1 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2014 Intelsat Corp had $658.1 million in aggregate principal amount of its 9 1 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2014, (the New Intelsat Corp 2014 Senior Notes) outstanding at December 31, 2009. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. If Intelsat Corp makes certain asset sales, Intelsat Corp may be required to offer to repurchase some or all of these notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and Special Interest (as defined in the Intelsat Corp 2014 Senior Notes), if any.

Intelsat Luxembourg then canceled the purchased 2017 PIK Notes. Note 12 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Interest Rate Swaps We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our variable rate borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk includes: the risk of increasing interest rates on short-term debt; the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed long-term financings; and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned refinancing using long-term fixed rate debt. In order to mitigate this risk, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate movements on future interest expense by converting substantially all of our floating-rate debt to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2009, we held interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.3 billion with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2014. These swaps were entered into as further described below to economically hedge the variability in cash flow on a portion of the floating-rate term loans under our senior secured and unsecured credit facilities, but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. On a quarterly basis, we receive a floating rate of interest on a $3.0 billion notional amount equal to the three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of interest. Additionally, on a $312.5 million notional amount, we receive a floating rate of interest equal to the one-month LIBOR plus a spread and pay a floating rate of interest equal to the three-month LIBOR. In July 2009, New Dawn entered into two floating to fixed interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments on loans under New Dawns senior and mezzanine term loan facilities. The first interest rate swap has an effective date of August 4, 2009 with varying notional amounts maturing on July 7, 2011. We receive an interest rate of three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed coupon of 1.55%. Interest payments for each quarterly period are deferred until the maturity date and all the accrued interest will be paid at maturity. The second interest rate swap has an effective date of July 7, 2011, maturing on July 7, 2014, with a notional amount of $65.5 million for mezzanine loans and varying notional amounts for underlying senior loans. We receive an interest rate of three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed coupon of 3.72%. Both these swaps were undesignated as hedges for accounting purposes. In June 2009, we entered into an interest rate basis swap with an aggregate notional principal amount of $312.5 million that will mature on March 15, 2010. Under this basis swap, F-57 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) we will pay interest based on the three month LIBOR rate and receive interest based on the one month LIBOR rate plus a fixed spread. In February 2008, we entered into five-year interest rate swaps with an effective date of March 14, 2008 to hedge interest expense on an aggregate notional amount of $2.35 billion expected to mature on March 14, 2013. Certain of these swaps contain options covering a notional amount of $717.0 million that would effectively permit us to terminate the underlying swaps on March 14, 2011, prior to the stated maturity of March 14, 2013. If we exercise the options, the cash flows (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) for the underlying swap and those from the options are expected to offset one another. On March 14, 2005, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Intelsat Corp, entered into a five-year interest rate swap to hedge interest expense on a notional amount of $1.25 billion of debt. On March 14, 2008, under the original terms of the swap agreement, the notional amount was reduced to $625.0 million, at which level it will remain until expiration on March 14, 2010. This swap was entered into to reduce the variability in cash flow on a portion of our floating-rate term loans. On a quarterly basis, we receive a floating rate of interest equal to the three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of interest that is subject to scheduled rate increases. The counterparties to such agreements are highly rated financial institutions. In the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of the interest rate swaps, our exposure is limited to the interest rate differential on the notional amount at each quarterly settlement period over the life of the agreement. We do not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. All of these interest rate swaps were undesignated as of December 31, 2009. The swaps have been marked-to-market with any change in fair value recorded within (gains) losses on derivative financial instruments in our consolidated statements of operations. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of our derivatives. The fair value measurement of derivatives could result in either a net asset or a net liability position for us. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting arrangements as applicable and necessary. When the swaps are in net liability position for us, the credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining the total expected exposure of the derivatives, incorporating the current and potential future exposures and then applying an applicable credit spread to the exposure. The total expected exposure of a derivative is derived using market-observable inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities. The inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on implied spreads from traded levels of our debt. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2009 we recorded a non-cash credit valuation adjustment of approximately $0.9 million that reduced our derivative liabilities by $0.9 million. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, $2.4 million and $11.2 million was included in other current liabilities, respectively, and $156.7 million and $88.6 million was included in other long-term liabilities, respectively, within our consolidated balance sheets related to the interest rate swaps. On the interest rate reset date of December 10, 2009, the interest rate which the counterparties utilized to compute interest due to us was determined to be 0.25425%. F-58 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Put Option Embedded Derivative Instrument As discussed in Note 11Long-Term Debt, following an evaluation of the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes Offering, we concluded that the contingent put option embedded within the indenture governing the 2009 Sub Holdco Notes meets the criteria under FASB ASC 815, to be bifurcated from the debt host instrument and classified as a derivative instrument. We estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative on the issuance date and will subsequently revalue the derivative at the end of each reporting period, recognizing any change in fair value through earnings. We use a standard valuation technique whereby the critical assumptions and underlyings include the debt maturity date, issue price, coupon rate, change of control put price, and the estimated date of a change in control. The fair value of the put option embedded derivative as of December 31, 2009 was $14.6 million based on our fair value analysis and $21.4 million of non-cash gain was recorded within gains or losses on derivative financial instruments during the year ended December 31, 2009. In accordance with disclosure requirements provided under FASB ASC 815, we include the following tabular presentation, which sets forth the fair value of our derivatives by category (in thousands): Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Balance Sheet Location December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 Undesignated interest rate swaps(a) Other long-term liabilities $ 15,662 $ 104,263 Undesignated interest rate swaps Other current liabilities  11,249 Put option embedded derivative Other long-term liabilities  14,600 Total derivatives $ 15,662 $ 130,112 (a) The value of undesignated interest rate swaps on our consolidated balance sheet is net of $15.7 million, which represents the fair value of options permitting us to terminate the underlying swaps.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) A rate reconciliation table was not required prior to the year ended December 31, 2009 as we were domiciled in Bermuda, a jurisdiction that does not impose income taxes. As a result of the Migration to Luxembourg, most of our operations are now located in taxable jurisdictions, including Luxembourg, the U.S. and the U.K. The Migration had no impact on our book tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of the Migration, we received a step-up in the tax basis of our migrated assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes have been provided for the difference between book value and tax value of our assets and liabilities, and were established at December 15, 2009 at the statutory income tax rate. However, because of our cumulative losses in recent years, and the inherent uncertainty associated with the realization of future income in the near term, we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009. Our Luxembourg companies generated a loss for the period from December 15 to December 31, 2009. We also recorded a full valuation allowance against the net operating and loss carryforwards. The components of the net deferred tax liability were as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2008 As of December 31, 2009 Deferred tax assets: Accruals and advances $ 5,642 $ 46,896 Amortizable intangible assets  673,359 Non-amortizable intangible assets  84,598 Performance incentives 44,707 44,097 Sales-type leases 26,119 20,895 Customer deposits 44,056 63,660 Debt issuance costs 13,624 8,360 Bad debt reserve 5,945 6,865 Accrued retirement benefits 94,811 52,414 Interest rate swap 32,930 19,209 Satellites and other property and equipment  67,275 Net operating loss carryforward 17,814 61,455 Capital loss carryforward  20,414 Alternative minimum tax credit carryforward 18,079 14,122 Other 10,841 7,589 Total deferred tax assets 314,568 1,191,208 Deferred tax liabilities: Satellites and other property and equipment (269,258 ) (297,301 ) Amortizable intangible assets (203,587 ) (178,527 ) Non-amortizable intangible assets (283,992 ) (240,960 ) Launch options (23,817 )  Debt obligations  (142,527 ) Other (10,114 ) (18,165 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (790,768 ) (877,480 ) Valuation allowance (850 ) (753,367 ) Total net deferred tax liabilities $ (477,050 ) $ (439,639 ) F-61 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) In connection with the sale of our equity method investment in WildBlue, we recognized a net deferred tax asset of $11.0 million related to historic differences between book value and tax basis in the equity investment. We also recorded a deferred tax asset for a capital loss carryforward related to this sale. Our valuation allowance at December 31, 2009 was $753.4 million, of which $699.9 million relates to the net deferred tax asset recorded as a result of the Migration and $20.4 million relates to our capital loss carryforwards, including $18.5 million from the sale of WildBlue. Almost all of the remaining valuation allowance relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, which are discussed further below. Certain of the operations of our subsidiaries are controlled by various intercompany agreements which provide these subsidiaries with predictable operating profits. Other subsidiaries, principally those that are subsidiaries of Intelsat Corp, are subject to the risks of our overall business conditions which make their earnings less predictable. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, our consolidated balance sheets include a deferred tax asset in the amount of $17.8 million and $61.5 million, respectively, attributable to the future benefit from the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards and $18.1 million and $14.1 million of deferred tax assets, respectively, attributable to the future benefit from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2009, we had tax effected U.S. federal, state and foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards of $43.0 million expiring between 2016 to 2029 and tax effected net operating loss carryforwards of $18.5 million having no expiration. Our alternative minimum tax credit carryforward was $14.1 million, which may be carried forward indefinitely. Our capital loss carryforward was $20.4 million, which may be carried forward for the next five years to offset capital gains. As we do not believe we will generate capital gains sufficient to offset these capital losses in the next five years an offsetting valuation allowance has been recorded. The schedule above shows an increase in the overall net operating loss carryforwards to reflect state loss carryforwards of $32.8 million, tax effected, that still exist after the use of the federal net operating losses, but for which we do not expect to be able to realize a future benefit. For this reason, a corresponding valuation allowance is included in the schedule above. This change in the presentation of state loss carryforwards at December 31, 2009 has no impact on the balance sheet or statement of operations. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands): 2008 2009 Balance at January 1 $ 62,537 $ 86,808 Increases related to current year tax positions 16,823 6,585 Increases related to prior year tax positions 20,005 17,496 Decreases related to prior year tax positions (4,544 ) (10,948 ) Expiration of statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes (7,518 ) (6,722 ) Decreases related to the settlement of tax positions (495 ) (6,298 ) Balance at December 31 $ 86,808 $ 86,921 As of December 31, 2009, our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $86.9 million (including interest and penalties), of which $68.1 million if recognized, would affect our effective F-62 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) tax rate. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, we had recorded reserves for interest and penalties of $6.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively. We continue to recognize interest and, to the extent applicable, penalties with respect to the unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. We operate in various taxable jurisdictions throughout the world and our tax returns are subject to audit and review from time to time. We consider Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the United States to be our significant tax jurisdictions. Our Luxembourg, U.S. and U.K. companies are subject to federal, state and local income tax examination for periods after July 18, 2001. During the third quarter of 2009, we received final notice from the U.K. tax authorities for amounts due related to the audit of our U.K. operations. We paid $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2009 related to the settlement of balances due. During the third quarter of 2008, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service began its audit of Intelsat Corp for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. We expect the audit to be closed for the period under review in the next twelve months. At this point in time, it is too early to anticipate the probability of any adjustments. We believe it is reasonably possible that in the next twelve months we will recognize a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations or the conclusion of ongoing audits of up to $27.2 million. Within the next twelve months, we believe that there are no other jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. During 2009, we recorded additional liabilities related to withholding taxes of $13.6 million in accordance with FASB ASC 740. This includes $12.8 million of new potential exposure resulting from certain sales in the Asia-Pacific market. As of December 31, 2009, we have not received any assessments with respect to this additional exposure, and it is our intention to appeal any such assessments. Tax Contingency Prior to August 20, 2004, our subsidiary, Intelsat Corp, joined with The DIRECTV Group and General Motors Corporation in filing a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. In April 2004, Intelsat Corp entered into a tax separation agreement with The DIRECTV Group that superseded four earlier tax-related agreements among Intelsat Corp and its subsidiaries, The DIRECTV Group and certain of its affiliates. Pursuant to the tax separation agreement, The DIRECTV Group agreed to indemnify Intelsat Corp for all federal and consolidated state and local income taxes a taxing authority may attempt to collect from Intelsat Corp regarding any liability for the federal or consolidated state or local income taxes of General Motors Corporation and The DIRECTV Group, except those income taxes Intelsat Corp is required to pay under the tax separation agreement. In addition, The DIRECTV Group agreed to indemnify Intelsat Corp for any taxes (other than those taxes described in the preceding sentence) related to any periods or portions of such periods ending on or prior to the day of the closing of the PanAmSat recapitalization, which occurred on August 20, 2004, in amounts equal to 80% of the first $75.0 million of such other taxes and 100% of any other taxes in excess of the first $75.0 million. As a result, Intelsat Corps tax exposure after indemnification related to these periods is capped at $15.0 million, of which $4.0 million has been paid to date. The tax separation agreement with The DIRECTV Group is effective from August 20, 2004 until the F-63 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to all taxes to which the tax separation agreement relates. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, we recorded tax indemnification receivables of $5.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Note 14 Restructuring and Transaction Costs Our restructuring and transaction costs include our historical facilities restructuring plans and management-approved restructuring plans to consolidate and integrate the management and operations of Intelsat and PanAmSat Holdco subsequent to consummation of the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions as well as transaction-related expenses incurred in connection with the New Sponsors Acquisition. (a) Facilities Restructuring Plan We approved a facilities restructuring plan subsequent to the consummation of the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions which included the closure of PanAmSats former corporate headquarters in Wilton, Connecticut, as well as two other locations in the United States. These costs relate primarily to payments due on existing lease obligations that are expected to be incurred and paid through 2011. PanAmSat also had recorded liabilities in connection with its 2002 approval of a plan to restructure several of its United States locations and close certain facilities, some of which are currently being leased through 2011. The facilities restructuring liability was $5.5 million and $2.9 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, the current portion of which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, with the remainder in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We expect to pay $1.9 million within the next 12 months in connection with the facilities restructuring plan. (b) Workforce Restructuring Plan As part of the consolidation and integration associated with the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions, we approved a workforce restructuring plan. This plan provided for the relocation and/or severance of employees due to planned facility closures. This workforce reduction covered approximately 400 employees. The remainder of the workforce restructuring liability of $0.4 million at December 31, 2008 was paid in June 2009. No remaining liability existed as of December 31, 2009. F-64 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) The following table summarizes the recorded accruals, which are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, employee related liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and activity related to the facilities restructuring and workforce restructuring (in millions): Facilities Restructuring Plan Workforce Restructuring Plan Total Predecessor entity Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 6.4 $ 6.7 $ 13.1 Net cash payments (0.1 ) (3.1 ) (3.2 ) Balance at January 31, 2008 6.3 3.6 9.9 Fair value adjustments $ (0.6 ) $  $ (0.6 ) Successor entity Balance at February 1, 2008 $ 5.7 $ 3.6 $ 9.3 Restructuring charges 1.9  1.9 Net cash payments (2.1 ) (3.2 ) (5.3 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 5.5 $ 0.4 $ 5.9 Other adjustments (0.8 )  (0.8 ) Net cash payments (1.8 ) (0.4 ) (2.2 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 2.9 $  $ 2.9 No additional charges related to the facilities restructuring plan or the workforce restructuring plan are expected to be incurred. Note 15 Contractual Commitments In the further development and operation of our commercial global communications satellite system, significant additional expenditures are anticipated. In connection with these and other expenditures, we have assumed a significant amount of long-term debt, as described in Note 11Long-Term Debt. In addition to these debt and related interest obligations, we have expenditures represented by other contractual commitments. The additional expenditures as of December 31, 2009 and the expected year of payment are as follows (in thousands): Satellite Construction and Launch Obligations Satellite Performance Incentive Obligations Horizons Contribution Obligations(1) Capital Leases Operating Leases Customer and Vendor Contracts Total 2010 $ 644,924 (2) $ 30,161 $ 13,556 $ 196 $ 2,705 $ 136,981 $ 828,523 2011 385,559 23,787 13,083  1,699 21,179 445,307 2012 60,400 23,446 13,012  (150 )(3) 14,419 111,127 2013 18,469 22,415 12,881  (1,084 )(3) 9,465 62,146 2014 13,369 20,955 12,684  (989 )(3) 1,125 47,144 2015 and thereafter 139,587 89,695   44,814 589 274,685 Total contractual commitments $ 1,262,308 $ 210,459 $ 65,216 $ 196 $ 46,995 $ 183,758 $ 1,768,932 (1) See Note 9Investments. F-65 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) (2) In 2010, the total Satellite Construction and Launch Obligations amount includes a payment obligation for our Thor 6 lease agreement that is not captured in our capitalized satellite expense, due to a special Hosted Payload contract. (3) In 2013 and 2014, the total of our rental income on our owned Washington, D.C. building (see (c) Operating Leases) and our sublease income on leased facilities will exceed our operating lease commitments. (a) Satellite Construction and Launch Obligations As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1.3 billion of expenditures remaining under our existing satellite construction and launch contracts. Satellite launch and in-orbit insurance contracts related to future satellites to be launched are cancelable up to thirty days prior to the satellites launch. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any non-cancelable commitments related to existing launch insurance or in-orbit insurance contracts for satellites to be launched. The satellite construction contracts typically require that we make progress payments during the period of the satellites construction. The satellite construction contracts contain provisions that allow us to terminate the contracts with or without cause. If terminated without cause, we would forfeit the progress payments and be subject to termination payments that escalate with the passage of time. If terminated for cause, we would be entitled to recover any payments we made under the contracts and certain liquidated damages as specified in the contracts. (b) Satellite Performance Incentive Obligations Satellite construction contracts also typically require that we make orbital incentive payments (plus interest as defined in each agreement with the satellite manufacturer) over the orbital life of the satellite. The incentive obligations may be subject to reduction or refund if the satellite fails to meet specific technical operating standards. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, we had $155.2 million and $147.5 million, respectively, recorded in relation to satellite performance incentive obligations, excluding future interest payments. (c) Operating Leases We have commitments for operating leases primarily relating to equipment and office facilities. These leases contain escalation provisions for increases. As of December 31, 2009, the total obligation related to operating leases, net of $16.8 million aggregate sublease income on leased facilities and rental income, was $47.0 million. We lease space in our Washington, D.C. building, which we own, to various tenants. As of December 31, 2009, the minimum rental income anticipated with respect to this building is $12.3 million, of which $11.4 million is expected to be received during the next five years. Rental income and sublease income are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Total rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, was $8.5 million, $0.6 million, $8.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively. F-66 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) (d) Customer and Vendor Contracts We have contracts with certain customers which require us to provide equipment, services and other support during the term of the related contracts. We also have long-term contractual obligations with service providers primarily for the operation of certain of our satellites. As of December 31, 2009, we had commitments under these customer and vendor contracts which totaled approximately $183.8 million related to the provision of equipment, services and other support. Note 16 Contingencies (a) Insurance As of December 31, 2009, the majority of our satellites were uninsured. Of the insured satellites, one was covered by an insurance policy with substantial exclusions or exceptions to coverage for failures of specific components identified by the underwriters as at risk for possible failure (Significant Exclusion Policies). The Significant Exclusion Policies reduce the probability of an insurance recovery in the event of a loss on this satellite. Galaxy 13/Horizons-1, which was placed in service in January 2004 and is insured by a policy with an exclusion for XIPS related anomalies, continues to have XIPS available as its primary propulsion system. It also has a bi-propellent fuel system currently in use, with sufficient bi-propellant fuel to maintain station-kept orbit until approximately 2016. An uninsured failure of one or more satellites could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, higher premiums on insurance policies would increase our costs, thereby reducing income from operations by the amount of such increased premiums. (b) Litigation and Claims We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, but management does not believe that the resolution of any pending proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. (c) LCO Protection Most of the customer service commitments entered into prior to our privatization were transferred to us pursuant to novation agreements. Certain of these agreements contain provisions, including provisions for lifeline connectivity obligation (LCO) protection, which constrain our ability to price services in some circumstances. Our LCO contracts require us to provide customers with the right to renew their service commitments covered by LCO contracts at prices no higher than the prices charged for those services on the privatization date. Under some circumstances, we may also be required by an LCO contract to reduce the price for a service commitment covered by the contract. LCO protection may continue until July 18, 2013. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $140.0 million of backlog covered by LCO contracts and to date we have not been required to reduce prices for our LCO-protected service commitments. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to reduce prices in the future under our LCO commitments. F-67 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) (d) Launch Service Providers One of our launch service providers, Sea Launch Company L.L.C. (Sea Launch), with which we have contracted for the future launch of one satellite, and have options for the launch of four additional satellites, has filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $43 million outstanding of payments made to Sea Launch relating to satellite launches that Sea Launch is still required to provide us. While Sea Launch is continuing to operate as a debtor-in-possession, and while we may receive full or partial credit for prior payments relating to the launches if Sea Launch is unable to perform the launches, there can be no assurance that Sea Launch will honor its contractual obligations to us, or do so without charging us significant additional amounts beyond what is provided for in our current agreements. In addition, should we try to procure alternative launch services for the satellites involved, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant delays and significant additional expenses as a result. Note 17 Business and Geographic Segment Information We operate in a single industry segment, in which we provide satellite services to our communications customers around the world. Revenue by region is based on the locations of customers to which services are billed. Our satellites are in geosynchronous orbit, and consequently are not attributable to any geographic location. Of our remaining assets, substantially all are located in the United States. The geographic distribution of our revenue was as follows: Predecessor Entity Successor Entity Year Ended December 31, 2007 Period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 Period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2009 North America 48 % 48 % 46 % 46 % Europe 15 % 16 % 17 % 17 % Africa and Middle East 17 % 18 % 17 % 17 % Latin America and Caribbean 12 % 11 % 12 % 12 % Asia Pacific 8 % 7 % 8 % 8 % Approximately 6%, 7%, 5% and 4% of our revenue was derived from our largest customer during the year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. The ten largest customers accounted for approximately 23%, 23%, 20% and 20% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively.

The shareholders agreement and the bye-laws of Intelsat Holdings provided, among other things, for the governance of Intelsat Holdings and its subsidiaries and provided specific rights to and limitations upon the holders of Intelsat Holdings share capital with respect to shares held by such holders. The agreement terminated upon the completion of the New Sponsors Acquisition, and the New Sponsors and other shareholders of Serafina Holdings entered into similar shareholders agreements on February 4, 2008. (b) Monitoring Fee Agreements and Transaction Fees In connection with the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition on February 4, 2008, Intelsat Luxembourg, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a new monitoring fee agreement (the 2008 MFA) with BC Partners and Silver Lake Management Company III, L.L.C. (together, the 2008 MFA parties), pursuant to which the 2008 MFA parties provide certain monitoring, advisory and consulting services to Intelsat Luxembourg. We recorded expense for services associated with the 2008 MFA of $8.5 million and $23.2 million during the successor period February 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. As payment for certain structuring and advisory services rendered, Intelsat Luxembourg also paid and expensed an aggregate transaction and advisory fee of $60.0 million to the 2008 MFA parties upon the closing of the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions. In connection with the closing of the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat Bermuda entered into a monitoring fee agreement (the 2006 MFA) with the Former Sponsors, or affiliates of, or entities advised by, designated by or associated with, the former sponsors, as the case may be (collectively, the 2006 MFA parties), pursuant to which the 2006 MFA parties F-69 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) provided certain monitoring, advisory and consulting services with respect to Intelsat Bermuda, PanAmSat Holdco and their respective subsidiaries. In connection with the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, this agreement was terminated. Pursuant to the 2006 MFA, an annual fee equal to the greater of $6.25 million or 1.25% of Intelsat Corp Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the indenture governing the 9% Senior Notes due 2016 of Intelsat Corp) was to be paid, and Intelsat Bermuda reimbursed the 2006 MFA parties for their out-of-pocket expenses. We recorded expense for services associated with the 2006 MFA of $11.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 and $0.7 million during the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008. In connection with the closing of our acquisition by Intelsat Holdings in January 2005, Intelsat SubHoldco entered into a monitoring fee agreement (the 2005 MFA) with Intelsat Holdings and the former sponsors, or affiliates of, or entities advised by, designated by or associated with, the former sponsors, as the case may be (collectively, the 2005 MFA parties), pursuant to which the 2005 MFA parties provided certain monitoring, advisory and consulting services to Intelsat. In connection with the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, this agreement was terminated. Pursuant to the 2005 MFA, Intelsat Sub Holdco was obligated to pay an annual fee equal to the greater of $6.25 million or 1.25% of adjusted EBITDA as defined in the indenture governing Intelsat Sub Holdcos 8 1 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2013 and Intelsat Sub Holdcos 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2015, and to reimburse the 2005 MFA parties for their out-of-pocket expenses. We recorded expense for services associated with the 2005 MFA of $12.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 and $1.0 million during the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008. (c) Ownership by Management In connection with and after the closing of the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat Holdings entered into SCAs under its existing 2005 Share Plan with certain directors, officers and key employees of Intelsat Holdings and its subsidiaries. In addition, upon consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition on February 4, 2008, all outstanding restricted performance shares under the 2005 Share Plan vested. Vesting in SCAs issued under the 2005 Share Plan doubled at consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition if the awardee was still employed on February 4, 2008. The vested SCAs were cancelled in return for cash in an amount equal to the excess of approximately $400 (the per share price of the transaction) over the exercise price of each share covered. Vested restricted shares (including time and performance vesting shares) were purchased at approximately $400 per share (the per share price specified in the BC Share Purchase Agreement). In connection with the vesting and modification of these awards upon the consummation of the acquisition, we recorded compensation expense of $197.2 million in January 2008. Certain directors, officers and key employees of Intelsat Global and its subsidiaries hold restricted shares, options and SCAs of Intelsat Global. In May 2009, Intelsat Global issued new restricted shares, SCAs and options to certain directors, officers and key employees under the 2008 Share Plan (see Note 5(a)2005 Share Plan and Note 5(b)2008 Share Plan). In May 2009, certain of our executive officers also purchased shares of Intelsat Global. In the aggregate, these shares and arrangements outstanding as of December 31, 2009 provided for the issuance of approximately 13.0% of the voting equity of Intelsat Global on a fully diluted basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) (d) Sponsor and Executive Investments Apollo Management V, L.P., one of our former sponsors, is the indirect controlling stockholder of Hughes Communications, Inc. and Hughes Network Systems, LLC (HNS). HNS is one of our largest network services customers. We recorded $119.2 million and $9.5 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007 and the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008, respectively, for satellite capacity and other services provided to HNS. The receivable outstanding from HNS as of December 31, 2007 was $12.5 million. Two members of the board of directors prior to the New Sponsors Acquisition, Messrs. Africk and Stone, served on the board of directors of Hughes Communications, Inc. and the board of managers of HNS. During 2008, affiliates or associates of funds and investment vehicles advised or controlled by one of the New Sponsors, Silver Lake, purchased $90.9 million of the 2017 Senior Notes and affiliates or associates of funds and investment vehicles advised or controlled by another of the New Sponsors, BC Partners, also purchased $90.9 million of the 2017 Senior Notes. Also during 2008, an entity associated with funds and investment vehicles advised or controlled by Silver Lake purchased a further $100.0 million of the 2017 Senior Notes and $650.0 million original principal amount of the 2017 PIK Notes. Mr. Svider, Chairman of our board of directors, Mr. McGlade, our Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chairman of our board of directors, and a trust of which Mr. Spector, our Executive Vice President, Business Development, and General Counsel, is the beneficiary, invested $3.8 million, $2.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, as limited partners in the entity through which the notes were purchased. (e) Horizons We have a 50% ownership interest in Horizons-1 and Horizons-2 as a result of a joint venture with JSAT (see Note 9Investments). (f) New Dawn We have a 74.9% ownership interest in New Dawn as a result of a project and shareholders agreement with Convergence Partners (see Note 9Investments). (g) Receivable from Parent We had a receivable from Intelsat Global as of December 31, 2008 and 2009 of $2.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively (see Note 7Receivables).

The quarterly results for the predecessor period January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2008 reflects the transaction costs impact of $313.1 million directly related to the New Sponsors Acquisition Transactions. The quarter ended June 30, 2008 includes a one-time impairment charge of $63.6 million related to the Galaxy 26 satellite anomaly. The quarter ended December 31, 2008 includes $326.8 million related to the impairment of our rights to operate at orbital locations. The quarter ended March 31, 2009 includes $499.1 million related to the impairment of our rights to operate at orbital locations. The quarter ended June 30, 2009 includes a $52.1 million gain on derivative financial instruments. Note 20 Subsequent Events On February 1, 2010 our IS-4 satellite experienced an anomaly. The anomaly has caused this satellite to be deemed unrecoverable, which we expect will result in a net non-cash impairment charge in February 2010 of $6.5 million to write off the value of the IS-4 satellite, which was not insured, and related deferred performance incentive obligations. We are working with the satellites manufacturer to determine the cause of the anomaly. Launched in 1995, IS-4 was expected to reach its end of service life later this year. The IS-4 had previously experienced the failure of its satellite control processor (SCP) and was operating on its backup SCP. F-72 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) Note 21 Supplemental Consolidating Financial Information In connection with the acquisition of Intelsat, Ltd. by Intelsat Holdings in January 2005, and related amalgamations, Intelsat Sub Holdco issued $2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of debt (the 2005 Acquisition Finance Notes), the majority of which was tendered and repurchased in change of control offers in June 2008. The 2005 Acquisition Finance Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Intelsat, Ltd., Intelsat Bermuda, Intelsat Jackson, Intermediate Holdco, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Intelsat Sub Holdco (the Subsidiary Guarantors). On February 11, 2005, Intelsat, Ltd. and Zeus Special Subsidiary Limited issued $478.7 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of 9 1 / 4 % Senior Discount Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Discount Notes), yielding approximately $305.3 million of net proceeds at issuance. On March 3, 2005, Intelsat Bermuda transferred substantially all of its assets to Intelsat Sub Holdco and Intelsat Sub Holdco assumed substantially all of the then-existing liabilities of Intelsat Bermuda. Following these transactions, Zeus Special Subsidiary Limited was amalgamated with Intelsat Bermuda, and Intelsat Bermuda became an obligor on the 2015 Discount Notes. On July 3, 2006, in connection with the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat Bermuda transferred the obligation on the 2015 Discount Notes to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intermediate Holdco. Intermediate Holdco became an obligor on the 2015 Discount Notes and confirmed its guarantee of the 2005 Acquisition Finance Notes and Intelsat Bermuda became a guarantor of the 2015 Discount Notes and confirmed its guarantee of the 2005 Acquisition Finance Notes. The 2015 Discount Notes are not guaranteed by any of Intelsat Bermudas direct or indirect subsidiaries. In connection with the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat Bermuda issued $1.33 billion of 11 1 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2016 and $260.0 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 (collectively, the July 2006 Notes). The July 2006 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Intelsat. The July 2006 Notes are not guaranteed by any of Intelsat Bermudas direct or indirect subsidiaries. On January 12, 2007, Intelsat Bermuda issued $600.0 million in Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2015 (the Refinancing Notes), which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Intelsat, Ltd. On February 4, 2008, promptly after the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, Intelsat Bermuda transferred certain of its assets and certain of its liabilities and obligations (including the July 2006 Notes, the Refinancing Notes and its senior unsecured credit facility) to a newly formed direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Intelsat Jackson. Intelsat Jackson became the obligor on the July 2006 Notes and the Refinancing Notes and a guarantor of the 2005 Acquisition Finance Notes and the 2015 Discount Notes, and Intelsat Bermuda confirmed its guarantee of the 2015 Discount Notes, the July 2006 Notes, the Refinancing Notes and the 2005 Acquisition Finance Notes. On February 7, 2008, Intelsat Jackson redeemed, pursuant to their terms, all $260.0 million of its Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 and all $600.0 million of its outstanding Refinancing Notes. F-73 Table of Contents INTELSAT S.A. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) In addition, on June 27, 2008, Intelsat Bermuda issued the 2017 Senior Notes and the 2017 PIK Notes, which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Intelsat, Ltd. Separate financial statements of Intelsat S.A., Intelsat Luxembourg, Intelsat Jackson, Intermediate Holdco, Intelsat Sub Holdco and the Subsidiary Guarantors are not presented because management believes that such financial statements would not be material to investors. Investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries in the following condensed consolidating financial information are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Consolidating adjustments include the following:  elimination of investment in subsidiaries;  elimination of intercompany accounts;  elimination of intercompany sales between guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries; and  elimination of equity in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries.

In connection with the PanAmSat Acquisition Transactions, Intelsat Bermuda issued $750.0 million of 9.25% Senior Notes due 2016 (the Jackson Guaranteed Notes). The Jackson Guaranteed Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Intelsat, its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Intelsat Sub Holdco, and the Subsidiary Guarantors. On February 4, 2008, promptly after the consummation of the New Sponsors Acquisition, Intelsat Bermuda transferred certain of its assets and certain of its liabilities and obligations (including the Jackson Guaranteed Notes) to Intelsat Jackson. Intelsat Jackson became the obligor on the Jackson Guaranteed Notes and Intelsat Bermuda confirmed its guarantee of the Jackson Guaranteed Notes. Separate financial statements of Intelsat S.A., Intelsat Luxembourg, Intelsat Jackson, Intelsat Sub Holdco and the Subsidiary Guarantors are not presented because management believes that such financial statement would not be material to investors. Investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries in the following condensed consolidating financial information are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Consolidating adjustments include the following:  elimination of investment in subsidiaries;  elimination of intercompany accounts;  elimination of intercompany sales between guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries; and  elimination of equity in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries.

Undertakings (a) The undersigned registrants hereby undertake: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering; and (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, if the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrants under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrants undertake that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrants pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such II-17 Table of Contents purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrants will be sellers to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrants relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants or used or referred to by the undersigned registrants; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrants or their securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrants to the purchaser. (b) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
