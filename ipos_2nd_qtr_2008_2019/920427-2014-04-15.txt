We have no agreements with any such investors to purchase our Common Stock at this time. HOW LONG WILL THE RIGHTS OFFERING LAST? You will be able to exercise your purchase rights only during a limited period. If you do not exercise your purchase rights before 5:00 p.m., prevailing Eastern time, on , 2014, your purchase rights will expire, unless we extend the rights offering in our sole discretion.

You may only purchase the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the number of purchase rights distributed to you in this offering.

The only significant activity of the Company is ownership and supervision of the Bank. At December 31, 2013, we had total assets of $921 million, total loans of $679 million and total deposits of $739 million. The Bank opened for business on September 16, 1991. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank, providing a wide range of business and consumer financial services through its main office in Clinton, New Jersey and fourteen New Jersey branches located in Clinton, Edison, Flemington, Highland Park, Linden, Middlesex, North Plainfield, Phillipsburg, Scotch Plains, Somerset, South Plainfield, Union, Washington and Whitehouse. In addition, the Bank has one Pennsylvania branch located in Forks Township. The Bank's primary service area encompasses the Route 22/Route 78 corridors between the Forks Township, Pennsylvania office and its Linden, New Jersey branch. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 64 Old Highway 22, Clinton, New Jersey, 08809, and the telephone number is (908) 730-7630. The Company's website address is www.unitybank.com. The Company's primary business is ownership and supervision of the Bank. The Company, through the Bank, conducts a traditional and community-oriented commercial banking business and offers services, including personal and business checking accounts, time deposits, money market accounts and regular savings accounts. The Company structures its specific services and charges in a manner designed to attract the business of the small and medium sized business and professional community, as well as that of individuals residing, working and shopping in its service area. The Company engages in a wide range of lending activities and offers commercial, Small Business Administration ("SBA"), consumer, mortgage, home equity and personal loans. In recent years, the Company, like many other real estate lenders, experienced higher levels of delinquent and non-performing assets. In addition, as a national SBA lender, we experienced higher levels of non-performing assets than our peers. In 2008, we withdrew from SBA lending outside of our primary market area, and began to take other steps to address our asset quality. Our total non-performing assets peaked at $27.0 million in 2009, and have declined to $15.9 million at December 31, 2013. As a percentage of our total assets, our nonperforming assets peaked at 3.18% at year-end 2011, and nonperforming assets constituted 1.73% of our total assets at December 31, 2013. As we have improved our asset quality, our financial performance has also improved. Our diluted earnings per share increased from $0.34 for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $0.53 per share in the year ended December 31, 2013. We also resumed our cash dividend, paying a dividend of $0.01 per share on June 28, 2013 to shareholders of record as of June 17, 2013. In addition, in 2008, we participated in the CPP, receiving an investment of $20.7 million in exchange for the issuance of shares of the Company's preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock. In the second and third quarters of 2013, we redeemed all of the outstanding preferred stock held by the UST in two transactions, for a total redemption price of $20.7 million, and repurchased the common stock purchase warrant issued to the UST for a payment of $2.7 million. Reasons for the Offering We are raising capital to support our future growth. As the economy in our trade area improves, we believe we will have additional opportunities to establish new relationships with borrowers and grow our loan portfolio. We have chosen to pursue a rights offering so that our shareholders have the opportunity to avoid or limit dilution of their ownership interests in our common stock. In addition, we 7 intend to conduct an offering of any shares not subscribed for in the rights offering to persons selected by us, in our sole discretion. Service Areas The Company's primary service area is defined as the neighborhoods served by the Bank's offices. The Bank's main office, located in Clinton, NJ, in combination with its Flemington and Whitehouse offices, serves the greater area of Hunterdon County. The Bank's North Plainfield and Somerset offices serve those communities located in the northern, eastern and central parts of Somerset County and the southernmost communities of Union County. The Bank's Scotch Plains, Linden, and Union offices serve the majority of the communities in Union County and the southwestern communities of Essex County. The offices in Middlesex, South Plainfield, Highland Park, and Edison extend the Company's service area into Middlesex County. The Bank's Phillipsburg and Washington offices serve Warren County. The Bank's Forks Township office serves Northampton County, Pennsylvania. 8 Summary Financial Data The following statements of operations data for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 have been derived from our audited financial statements and related notes which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus.

See "Market Price of Common Stock." 11 RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties and the risk factors set forth in the documents and reports filed with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus and the risks described below before you make an investment decision regarding the common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities can be materially and adversely affected by many events and conditions including the following: We have been and may continue to be adversely affected by national financial markets and economic conditions, as well as local conditions. Our business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the United States, including factors such as the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, investor confidence and the strength of the U.S. economy. The deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our securities and loan portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, our capital levels, liquidity and our results of operations. In addition, we are affected by the economic conditions within our New Jersey and Pennsylvania trade areas. Though there have been signs of improvement, economic growth in these areas has been slow to recover. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in the six counties in the New Jersey market and one county in Pennsylvania in which we have branches, so any decline in the economy of New Jersey or eastern Pennsylvania could have an adverse impact on us. Our loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of collateral securing these loans are impacted by economic conditions. Our financial results, the credit quality of our existing loan portfolio, and the ability to generate new loans with acceptable yield and credit characteristics may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, including declines in real estate values, changes in interest rates, adverse employment conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Although economic conditions in our primary market have fared better than other areas of the United States, we cannot assure you that these conditions will continue to prevail. We cannot assure you that positive trends or developments discussed in this annual report will continue or that negative trends or developments will not have a significant adverse effect on us. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 96 percent of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. Continued weakening of the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. Any future declines in home prices in the New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets we serve also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolios. Stress in the real estate market, combined with weak economic conditions and continued elevated unemployment levels could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. In that event, our earnings could be adversely affected. 12 Our offering of alternative credit products may expose us to increased lending risks. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the loan may be unenforceable. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this ability-to-repay rule for "Qualified Mortgages". A rule issued by the CFPB in January 2013, and effective January 10, 2014, sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. The criteria generally exclude loans that (1) are interest-only, (2) have excessive upfront points or fees, or (3) have negative amortization features, balloon payments, or terms in excess of 30 years. The underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%, based upon documented and verifiable information. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a "higher priced loan" as defined in Federal Reserve regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer's ability to repay. However, a consumer may assert the lender's failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than Qualified Mortgages. Although the majority of residential mortgages historically originated by the Bank would be considered Qualified Mortgages, the Bank has and may continue to make residential mortgage loans that would not qualify. The Bank is still evaluating the impact of the recently issued Qualified Mortgage definition and related ability-to-repay rules, as well as other rules recently issued by the by the CFPB related to mortgage origination and servicing, to determine if such rules will have any long-term impact on its mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. As a result of such rules, the Bank might experience increased compliance costs, loan losses, litigation related expenses and delays in taking title to real estate collateral, if these loans do not perform and borrowers challenge whether the Bank satisfied the ability-to-repay rule upon originating the loan. There is a risk that the SBA will not honor their guarantee. The Company has historically been a participant in various SBA lending programs which guarantee up to 90% of the principal on the underlying loan. There is a risk that the SBA will not honor their guarantee if a loan is not underwritten and administered to SBA guidelines. The Company follows the underwriting guidelines of the SBA; however our ability to manage this will depend on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees who have knowledge of the SBA program. There is a risk that we may not be repaid in a timely manner, or at all, for loans we make. The risk of nonpayment (or deferred or delayed payment) of loans is inherent in commercial banking. Such nonpayment, or delayed or deferred payment of loans to the Company, if they occur, may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition. Additionally, in compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses created through charges against earnings. As of December 31, 2013, the Company's allowance for loan losses was $13.1 million, or 1.94 percent of our total loan portfolio and 85.98 percent of our nonperforming loans. The Company's marketing focus on small to medium size businesses may result in the assumption by the Company of certain lending risks that are different from or greater than those which would apply to loans made to larger companies. We seek to minimize our credit risk exposure through credit controls, which include evaluation of potential borrowers' available collateral, liquidity and cash flow. However, there can be no assurance that such procedures will actually reduce loan losses. 13 We have a significant level of nonperforming assets, and this has, and will continue, to affect our results of operations. At December 31, 2013, our total nonperforming assets equaled $15.9 million or 2.34 percent of total loans and OREO. This is a significant level of nonperforming assets compared to our peer group institutions. Our level of nonperforming assets reflects the general economic slowdown in our marketplace and its effect on our borrowers, and our focus on SBA lending, which may entail greater credit risk than other types of lending. This deterioration in credit quality has negatively impacted our results of operations, through additional provisions for loan losses and reduced interest income, and will continue to impact our performance until these assets are resolved. In addition, future increases in our nonperforming assets will further negatively affect our results of operations. We can give you no assurance that our nonperforming assets will not increase further. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the results of our operations. Risks within the loan portfolio are analyzed on a continuous basis by management; and, periodically, by an independent loan review function and by the Audit Committee. A risk system, consisting of multiple-grading categories, is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and the appropriate level of loss reserves. Along with the risk system, management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrowers, past and expected loan loss experience and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an adequate reserve. This risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly and, as adjustments become necessary, they are realized in the periods in which they become known. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. State and federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for loan losses and have in the past required an increase in our allowance for loan losses. Although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable and reasonably estimated losses, we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that our regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could adversely affect our earnings. We are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance. Net interest income, the difference between interest earned on our interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, represents a significant portion of our earnings. Both increases and decreases in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits. Interest rates are subject to factors which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest Unity receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) Unity's ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of Unity's financial assets and liabilities, including the held to maturity and available for sale securities portfolios, and (iii) the average duration of Unity's interest-earning assets. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the 14 same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk). The banking business is subject to significant government regulations. We are subject to extensive governmental supervision, regulation and control. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and may require substantial modifications to our operations or may cause us to incur substantial additional compliance costs. These laws and regulations are designed to protect depositors and the public, but not our shareholders. In addition, future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the commercial banking industry and our operations. Such governing laws can be anticipated to continue to be the subject of future modification. Our management cannot predict what effect any such future modifications will have on our operations. In addition, the primary focus of Federal and state banking regulation is the protection of depositors and not the shareholders of the regulated institutions. For example, the recently adopted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") has resulted in substantial new compliance costs, and may restrict certain sources of revenue. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2011. Generally, the Act is effective the day after it was signed into law, but different effective dates apply to specific sections of the law, many of which will not become effective until various Federal regulatory agencies have promulgated rules implementing the statutory provisions. Uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole, or on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things:  capped debit card interchange fees for institutions with $10 billion in assets or more at $0.21 plus 5 basis points times the transaction amount, a substantially lower rate than the average rate in effect prior to adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act;  provided for an increase in the FDIC assessment for depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, increases in the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% and changes the basis for determining FDIC premiums from deposits to assets;  permanently increased the deposit insurance coverage to $250 thousand and allowed depository institutions to pay interest on checking accounts;  created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad authority to enforce these laws;  provided for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance;  changed standards for Federal preemption of state laws related to federally-chartered institutions and their subsidiaries;  provided mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer's ability to repay, restricting variable rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions; and  created a financial stability oversight council that will recommend to the Federal Reserve increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity. 15 In addition, in order to implement Basel III and certain additional capital changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, on July 9, 2013, the FRB approved, as an interim final rule, the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. bank holding companies, such as us, substantially similar to final rules issued by the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. These new requirements are likely to increase our capital requirements in future periods. See "Supervisions and RegulationGeneral Bank Holding Company Regulation." These provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our management is actively reviewing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, many of which are to be phased-in over the next several months and years, and assessing the probable impact on our operations. However, the ultimate effect of these changes on the financial services industry in general, and us in particular, is uncertain at this time. We are subject to changes in accounting policies or accounting standards. Understanding Unity's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our financial results. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of assets or liabilities and financial results. Unity has identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, security valuations and impairments, goodwill and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available. From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change their guidance governing the form and content of Unity's external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and Unity's outside auditors, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Such changes are expected to continue, and may accelerate based on the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board commitments to achieving convergence between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Changes in U.S. GAAP and changes in current interpretations are beyond Unity's control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how Unity reports its financial results and condition. In certain cases, Unity could be required to apply a new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently (also retroactively) which may result in Unity restating prior period financial statements for material amounts. Additionally, significant changes to U.S. GAAP may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations. Declines in value may adversely impact the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $81.1 million and $26.4 million in available for sale and held to maturity investment securities, respectively. We may be required to record impairment charges in earnings related to credit losses on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. Additionally, (a) if we intend to sell a security or (b) it is 16 more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will be required to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge in the statement of income equal to the full amount of the decline in fair value below amortized cost. Factors, including lack of liquidity, absence of reliable pricing information, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio and may result in other-than-temporary impairment on our investment securities in future periods. Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is the potential that Unity will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to persistent weakness, or downturn, in the economy or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not necessarily specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. We are in competition with many other banks, including larger commercial banks which have greater resources than us. The banking industry within the State of New Jersey is highly competitive. The Company's principal market area is also served by branch offices of large commercial banks and thrift institutions. In addition, in 1999 the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act was passed into law. The Modernization Act permits other financial entities, such as insurance companies and securities firms, to acquire or form financial institutions, thereby further increasing competition. A number of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to expend upon advertising and marketing, and their substantially greater capitalization enables them to make much larger loans. Our success depends a great deal upon our judgment that large and mid-size financial institutions do not adequately serve small businesses in our principal market area and upon our ability to compete favorably for such customers. In addition to competition from larger institutions, we also face competition for individuals and small businesses from recently formed banks seeking to compete as "hometown" institutions. Most of these new institutions have focused their marketing efforts on the smaller end of the small business market we serve. Future offerings of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our stock. In the future, if our or the Bank's capital ratios fall below the prevailing regulatory required minimums, we or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of common stock or preferred stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. 17 We cannot predict how changes in technology will impact our business. The financial services market, including banking services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in:  telecommunications;  data processing;  automation;  Internet-based banking;  Tele-banking; and  debit cards/smart cards Our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on whether we can anticipate and respond to technological changes. To develop these and other new technologies, we will likely have to make additional capital investments. Although we continually invest in new technology, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources or access to the necessary proprietary technology to remain competitive in the future. The Company's information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company's customer-relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as us) and to the risk that our (or our vendors') business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. We maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor's organizational structure or internal controls, (ii) changes in the vendor's financial condition, (iii) changes in the vendor's support for existing products and services and (iv) changes in the vendor's strategic focus. In addition we maintain cyber liability insurance to mitigate against any loss incurred. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur; or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Company's information systems could damage the Company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability; any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Our business strategy could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees and manage our expenses. We expect to continue to experience growth in the scope of our operations and, correspondingly, in the number of our employees and customers. We may not be able to successfully manage our business as a result of the strain on our management and operations that may result from this growth. Our ability to manage this growth will depend upon our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees. Our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent customer relationships and to hire, train and manage our employees. 18 Hurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Hurricanes and other weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. In addition, these weather events may result in a decline in value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses. Risks Factors Related to the Rights Offering The subscription price determined for the rights offering is not necessarily an indication of the fair value of our common stock. The per share price of $ in the rights offering is not necessarily related to our book value, tangible book value, multiple of earnings or any other established criteria of fair value and may or may not be considered the fair value of our common stock to be offered in the rights offering. After the date of this prospectus, our shares of common stock may trade at prices below the price in the rights offering. In addition, the price of our common stock may fluctuate between the time you exercise your subscription rights and your receipt of shares following the conclusion of the rights offering. Once made, all exercises of subscription rights are irrevocable and, as a result, you bear the financial risk that the price of our common stock will fluctuate during that period. If you do not exercise your subscription rights, your percentage ownership will be diluted. Assuming we sell the full amount of shares issuable in connection with the offerings, we will issue approximately 760,163 shares of our common stock. If you choose not to exercise your basic subscription rights prior to the expiration of the rights offering, your relative ownership interest in our common stock will be diluted. We may cancel the rights offering at any time without further obligation to you. We may, in our sole discretion, cancel the rights offering before it expires. If we cancel the rights offering, neither we nor the subscription agent will have any obligation to you except to return any payment received by the subscription agent, without interest, as soon as practicable. The subscription rights are not transferable and there is no market for the subscription rights. You may not sell, give away or otherwise transfer your subscription rights. The subscription rights are only transferable by operation of law. Because the subscription rights are non-transferable, there is no market or other means for you to directly realize any value associated with the subscription rights. You must exercise the subscription rights and acquire shares to realize any potential value from your subscription rights. If you do not act promptly and follow the subscription instructions, your exercise of subscription rights will be rejected. If you desire to purchase shares in the rights offering, you must act promptly to ensure that the subscription agent actually receives all required forms and payments before the expiration of the rights offering at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on , 2014, unless we extend the rights offering for additional periods. If you fail to complete and sign the required subscription forms, send an incorrect payment amount, or otherwise fail to follow the subscription procedures that apply to your desired transaction, we may, depending on the circumstances, reject your subscription or accept it to the extent of the payment received. If your exercise is rejected, your payment of the exercise price will be 19 promptly returned. Neither we nor our subscription agent undertakes to contact you concerning, or attempt to correct, an incomplete or incorrect subscription form or payment. We have the sole discretion to determine whether a subscription exercise properly follows the subscription procedures and to decide all questions as to the validity, form and eligibility (including times of receipt and beneficial ownership). Alternative, conditional or contingent subscriptions will not be accepted. We reserve the absolute right to reject any subscriptions not properly submitted. In addition, we may reject any subscription if the acceptance of the subscription would be unlawful. We also may waive any irregularities (or conditions) in the subscription. If you are given notice of a defect in your subscription, you will have five business days after the giving of notice to correct it. You will not, however, be allowed to cure any defect later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the expiration date. We are not obligated to give you notification of defects in your subscription. We will not consider an exercise to be made until all defects have been cured or waived. If you make payment of the subscription price by personal check, your check may not have cleared in sufficient time to enable you to purchase shares in this rights offering. Any personal check used to pay for shares to be issued in this rights offering must clear prior to the expiration time of this rights offering, and the clearing process may require five (5) or more business days. If you choose to exercise your subscription rights, in whole or in part, and to pay for shares by personal check and your check has not cleared prior to the expiration time of this rights offering, you will not have satisfied the conditions to exercise your subscription rights and will not receive the shares you attempted to purchase and you will lose the value of your subscription rights. You will not be able to sell the shares you buy in the rights offering until you receive your stock certificates or your account is credited with the common stock. If you purchase shares in the rights offering by submitting a rights certificate and payment, we will issue shares in book-entry form or mail you a stock certificate as soon as practicable after , 2014, or such later date as to which the rights offering may be extended. If your shares are held by a broker, dealer, custodian bank or other nominee and you purchase shares, your account with your nominee will be credited with the shares of our common stock you purchased in the rights offering as soon as practicable after the expiration of the rights offering, or such later date as to which the rights offering may be extended. Until your shares have been issued in book-entry form, your stock certificates have been delivered or your account is credited, you may not be able to sell your shares. The stock price may decline between the time you decide to sell your shares and the time you are actually able to sell your shares. Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from the offerings, and we may not invest the proceeds successfully. We currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of the offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, to support future growth such as branching and infrastructure. Our management may allocate the proceeds among these purposes as it deems appropriate. In addition, market factors may require our management to allocate portions of the proceeds for other purposes. Accordingly, you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the use of the proceeds from the offerings, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether we are using the proceeds appropriately. It is possible that we may invest the proceeds in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for us. 20 USE OF PROCEEDS Assuming all of the rights are exercised in the rights offering, we expect that the net proceeds from the rights offering following payment of transaction-related expenses will be approximately up to $ . The net proceeds will be used for capital enhancement and general corporate purposes and to support the continued growth of our earning assets. MARKET PRICE OF COMMON STOCK Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Market, under the symbol "UNTY." As of March 26, 2014, we had approximately 405 holders of record. The following table shows the high and low sales price during the periods indicated, as well as dividends declared: Price Range Quarterly Dividends per Share of Common Stock High Low 2011 Fourth Quarter $ 6.76 $ 6.25 $ 0.00 Third Quarter 6.79 6.36 0.00 Second Quarter 7.00 6.48 0.00 First Quarter 7.20 6.09 0.00 2012 Fourth Quarter 6.25 5.75 0.00 Third Quarter 6.15 5.88 0.00 Second Quarter 6.25 5.92 0.00 First Quarter 6.40 5.98 0.00 2013 Fourth Quarter 7.98 7.10 0.01 Third Quarter 8.13 6.74 0.01 Second Quarter 7.55 6.22 0.01 First Quarter 6.74 5.85 0.00 DIVIDEND POLICY Prior to our participation in the CPP, we had paid regular quarterly cash dividends. Under the terms of the CPP, our ability to pay cash dividends was restricted, and we ceased paying cash dividends in the first quarter of 2009 as we sought to conserve capital due to weakening economic conditions and an increase in our non-performing assets. In the second and third quarters of 2013, we fully redeemed all outstanding preferred stock issued to the UST through the CPP. In addition, as economic conditions and our asset quality has improved, we paid a $0.01 per share cash dividend in June of 2013. Our future dividend policy will depend on a number of factors, including our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. At this time, no decision has been made regarding the payment of future cash dividends. 21 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our consolidated capitalization as of December 31, 2013, on an actual basis and on a pro forma basis as adjusted to give effect to this offering, at an offering price as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus).

Funds Held by the Subscription Agent Pending Delivery of Shares The subscription agent will hold your payment of the subscription price payment in a segregated account with other payments received from other rights holders until we issue your shares to you upon consummation of the rights offering. Notice to Record Holders Holding on Behalf of Beneficial Owners If you are a broker, a trustee or a depositary for securities who holds shares of our common stock for the account of others on , 2014, the record date for the rights offering, you should notify the respective beneficial owners of such shares of the rights offering as soon as possible to find out their intentions with respect to exercising their subscription rights. You should obtain instructions from the beneficial owner with respect to their subscription rights, as set forth in the instructions we have provided to you for your distribution to beneficial owners. If the beneficial owner so instructs, you should complete the appropriate subscription agreements and submit them to the subscription agent with the proper payment. If you hold shares of our common stock for the account(s) of more than one beneficial owner, you may exercise the number of subscription rights to which all such beneficial owners in the aggregate otherwise would have been entitled had they been direct record holders of our common stock on the record date for the rights offering, provided that, you, as a nominee record holder, make a proper showing to the subscription agent by submitting the form entitled "Nominee Holder Certification" which we will provide to you with your rights offering materials. If you did not receive this form, you should contact us to request a copy. Beneficial Owners If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock or will receive your subscription rights through a broker, custodian bank or other nominee, we will ask your broker, custodian bank or other nominee to notify you of this rights offering. If you wish to exercise your subscription rights, you will need to have your broker, custodian bank or other nominee act for you. If you hold certificates of our common stock directly and would prefer to have your broker, custodian bank or other nominee exercise your subscription rights, you should contact your nominee and request it to effect the transaction for you. To indicate your decision with respect to your subscription rights, you should complete and return to your broker, custodian bank or other nominee the form entitled "Beneficial Owners Election Form." You should receive this form from your broker, custodian bank or other nominee with the other rights offering materials.

You should allow a sufficient number of days to ensure delivery to the subscription agent prior to the time the rights offering expires.

OFFERING OF REMAINING SHARES TO INVESTORS WHO ARE NOT CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS Expiration Date The offering period to investors who are not current shareholders will expire at the earlier of 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight time, on , 2014 or the date on which we have accepted subscriptions for all shares remaining for purchase as reflected in the prospectus supplement. Discretion To Accept Subscriptions We have the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject any subscription in whole or in part on or before the expiration of the offering period described above. We will notify subscribers no later than ten (10) days after the expiration date as to whether and to what extent their subscriptions have been accepted. If we do not accept all or a portion of a subscription, we will return to the subscriber the unaccepted portion of the subscription funds, without interest. Issuance Of Stock Certificates Promptly after the acceptance of a subscription the Company will issue stock certificates representing the shares of Common Stock purchased by investors. The Company will follow the instructions contained in the accepted Subscription Agreements when it issues the stock certificates. Subscription Proceeds We will promptly deposit all subscription proceeds as we receive them in a noninterest-bearing deposit account with the Bank. Upon our acceptance of a subscription, the related subscription proceeds due to us will become immediately available for our use. Promptly following the expiration of the offering period, we will refund any amounts due to subscribers whose subscriptions we did not accept as described under "Discretion to Accept Subscriptions" above. DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK We are authorized by our certificate of incorporation to issue 12,500,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share, and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, the terms, rights and features of which are determined by our Board of Directors upon issuance. As of the date hereof, we have 7,601,632 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. All shares of common stock are entitled to share equally in dividends from funds legally available therefore, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, and upon liquidation or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, to share equally in the assets of the Company available for distribution to shareholders, after satisfying in full the preferential liquidation rights of any series of 28 preferred stock that may be authorized and issued in the future. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to the shareholders. There is no cumulative voting, redemption right, sinking fund provision, or right of conversion in existence with respect to the common stock. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide for preemptive rights to acquire additional shares of common stock when issued. All of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Preferred Stock Effective on July 3, 2013, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our preferred stock, We therefore have no shares of preferred stock outstanding. We currently have 500,000 shares of preferred stock authorized and available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors without shareholder approval. The Board of Directors has the authority to prescribe for each series of preferred stock it establishes the number of shares in that series, the number of votes (if any) to which the shares in that series are entitled, the consideration for the shares in that series, and the designations, powers, preferences and other rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares in that series. Depending upon the rights prescribed for a series of preferred stock, the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse effect on the voting power of the holders of common stock and could adversely affect holders of common stock by delaying or preventing a change in control, making removal of our present management more difficult or imposing restrictions upon the payment of dividends and other distributions to the holders of common stock. Anti-Takeover Provisions The provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the New Jersey corporation law summarized in the following paragraphs may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer, or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider to be in such shareholder's best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by shareholders, and may make removal of management more difficult. Authorized but Unissued Stock The authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without shareholder approval. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions, and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of common and preferred stock may enable our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, which could render more difficult or discourage any attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of our management. Number of Directors Our current board is comprised of 9 directors. Our certificate of incorporation currently provides that the Board of Directors shall consist of not less than 1 or more than 15 directors. The number of directors may be amended only by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office or the affirmative vote of shareholders owning at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. Classified Board of Directors Our certificate of incorporation divides the Board of Directors into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms. As a result, approximately one-third of the Board of Directors will be elected at each annual meeting of shareholders. The classification of directors will have the effect of 29 making it more difficult for shareholders to change the composition of the Board of Directors. As a result, at least two annual meetings of shareholders may be required for the shareholders to change a majority of the directors, whether or not a change in the Board of Directors would be beneficial to the Company and its shareholders and whether or not a majority of the Company's shareholders believes that such a change would be desirable. Bank Regulatory Requirements Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act (the "Control Act"), a 60 day prior written notice must be submitted to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB") if any person, or any group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10% or more of any class of outstanding voting securities of a bank holding company, unless the FRB determines that the acquisition will not result in a change of control. Under the Control Act, the FRB has 60 days within which to act on such notice taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer, the convenience and needs of the community served by the bank holding company and its subsidiary banks and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ('BHCA"), a company is generally required to obtain prior approval of the FRB before it may obtain control of a bank holding company. Under the BHCA, control is generally described to mean the beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a company, although a presumption of control may exist if a party beneficially owns 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a company and certain other circumstances are present. New Jersey Shareholders Protection Act A provision of New Jersey law, the New Jersey Shareholders Protection Act (the "SPA"), prohibits certain transactions involving an "interested stockholder" and a corporation. An "interested stockholder" is generally defined as one who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the corporation. The SPA prohibits certain business combinations between an interested stockholder and a New Jersey corporation subject to the SPA for a period of five years after the date the interested stockholder acquired his stock, unless the transaction was approved by the corporation's board of directors prior to the time the interested stockholder acquired his stock. After the five-year period expires, the prohibition on business combinations with an interested stockholder continues unless certain conditions are met. The conditions include (i) that the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the target corporation; (ii) that the business combination is approved by a vote of two-thirds of the voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder; and (iii) that the stockholders of the corporation receive a price in accordance with the SPA. 30 CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES General The following discussion is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders (as defined below) of the receipt and ownership of the subscription rights acquired in the rights offering and the ownership of shares of common stock received upon exercise of the subscription rights. You are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of subscription rights or shares of common stock and you are:  an individual citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source; or  a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more "United States persons," as defined in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Department regulations to be treated as a United States person. The following discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, regulations promulgated by the Treasury Department thereunder, and administrative rulings and judicial decisions, in each case as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively, resulting in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. We have not sought any ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in this discussion, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions. This discussion applies only to U.S. holders who acquire the subscription rights in the rights offering. Further, this discussion assumes that the subscription rights or shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the subscription rights will be held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. In addition, this summary does not address all tax considerations that may be applicable to your particular circumstances or to you if you are a U.S. holder that may be subject to special tax rules, including, without limitation:  banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions;  regulated investment companies;  real estate investment trusts;  dealers in securities or commodities;  traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings;  tax-exempt organizations;  persons liable for alternative minimum tax;  persons that hold shares of Common Stock as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction;  partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes; or 31  persons whose "functional currency" is not the United States dollar. If a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) receives the subscription rights or holds shares of common stock received upon exercise of the subscription rights, the tax treatment of a partner in a partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to the United States federal income tax consequences of the receipt and ownership of the subscription rights or the ownership of shares of Common Stock received upon exercise of the subscription rights. This discussion addresses only certain aspects of United States federal income taxation. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences of the receipt and ownership of the subscription rights acquired in the rights offering and the ownership of shares of common stock received upon exercise of the subscription rights or, if applicable, upon exercise of the over subscription privilege. Taxation of Subscription Rights Receipt of Subscription Rights Your receipt of subscription rights in the rights offering should be treated as a nontaxable distribution for United States federal income tax purposes. The discussion below assumes that the receipt of subscription rights will be treated as a nontaxable distribution. Tax Basis and Holding Period of Subscription Rights Your tax basis of the subscription rights for United States federal income tax purposes will depend on the fair market value of the subscription rights you receive and the fair market value of your existing shares of Common Stock on the date you receive the subscription rights. If the fair market value of the subscription rights you receive is 15% or more of the fair market value of your existing shares of common stock on the date you receive the subscription rights, then you must allocate the tax basis of your existing shares of common stock between the existing shares of common stock and the subscription rights you receive in proportion to their respective fair market values determined on the date you receive the subscription rights.  If the fair market value of the subscription rights you receive is less than 15% of the fair market value of your existing shares of common stock on the date you receive the subscription rights, the subscription rights will be allocated a zero tax basis, unless you elect to allocate the tax basis of your existing shares of common stock between the existing shares of common stock and the subscription rights you receive in proportion to their respective fair market values determined on the date you receive the subscription rights. If you choose to allocate the tax basis between your existing shares of common stock and the subscription rights, you must make this election on a statement included with your United States federal income tax return for the taxable year in which you receive the subscription rights. Such an election is irrevocable.  The fair market value of the subscription rights on the date the subscription rights are distributed is uncertain, and we have not obtained, and do not intend to obtain, an appraisal of the fair market value of the subscription rights on that date. In determining the fair market value of the subscription rights, you should consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including any difference between the subscription price of the subscription rights and the trading price of our common stock on the date that the subscription rights are distributed, the length of the period during which the subscription rights may be exercised and the fact that the subscription rights are non-transferable. 32 Your holding period of the subscription rights will include your holding period of the shares of common stock with respect to which the subscription rights were distributed. Exercise of Subscription Rights You generally will not recognize gain or loss upon exercise of the subscription rights. The tax basis of the shares of common stock you receive upon exercise of the subscription rights generally will equal the sum of (i) the subscription price and (ii) the tax basis, if any, of the subscription rights as determined above. Your holding period of the shares of common stock you receive upon exercise of the subscription rights will begin on the date the subscriptions rights are exercised. Expiration of Subscription Rights If you do not exercise the subscription rights, you should not recognize a capital loss for United States federal income tax purposes and any portion of the tax basis of your existing shares of common stock previously allocated to the subscription rights not exercised will be re-allocated to the existing common stock. Taxation of Common Stock Distributions with respect to shares of common stock received upon exercise of the subscription rights will be taxable as dividend income when actually or constructively received to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, if any, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes. To the extent that the amount of a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your adjusted tax basis of such shares of common stock and thereafter as capital gain. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, distributions on the shares of common stock constituting dividend income paid to U.S. holders that are domestic corporations generally will qualify for the dividends-received deduction. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicable dividend tax rates and the availability of the dividends-received deduction in light of your particular circumstances. If you sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of the common stock, you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between your amount realized and your adjusted tax basis of such shares of common stock. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period for such shares of common stock is more than one year. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. income tax at preferential rates. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the availability of such rates in light of your particular circumstances. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Additional Medicare Tax on Unearned Income With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013, if you are an individual, estate or trust, you may be subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on unearned income, including dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stock. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the implications of the additional Medicare tax resulting from an investment in the common stock. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding In general, payments made in the United States or through certain United States related financial intermediaries with respect to the ownership and disposition of the shares of common stock will be required to be reported to the IRS unless you are a corporation or other exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrate this fact. In addition, you may be subject to a backup withholding tax (currently 33 at a rate of 28%) on such payments unless you (i) are a corporation or other exempt recipient and when required, demonstrate this fact or (ii) provide a taxpayer identification number and otherwise comply with applicable certification requirements. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable. The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and you may use amounts withheld as a credit against your United States federal income tax liability or may claim a refund so long as you timely provide certain information to the IRS. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act On February 8, 2012, the Treasury Department issued proposed regulations relating to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, which was enacted in March of 2010. As a general matter, FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on dividends on, and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our common stock if paid to a foreign entity (whether such foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary) unless (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial institution," the foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," the foreign entity certifies that it does not have any substantial United States owners or provides the name, address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner and such entity meets certain other specified requirements, or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under FATCA. Under the proposed regulations, withholding is required (i) with respect to dividends on our common stock beginning on January 1, 2014, and (ii) with respect to gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock that occurs on or after January 1, 2015. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proposed regulations will not be effective until issued in final form. There can be no assurance either as to when final regulations relating to FATCA will be issued or as to the particular form that those final regulations might take. If withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to our common stock, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such payment generally will be subject to FATCA withholding and, even if an exception or reduction continues to apply, will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. We will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA in your particular circumstances. 34 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION On or about , 2014, we will distribute the subscription rights, subscription agreements and copies of this prospectus to persons that owned shares of common stock on , 2014.

Undertakings. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; II-3 (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement; (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. (5) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (6) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and II-4 Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (7) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to rule 424(b)(1), or (4), or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (8) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
