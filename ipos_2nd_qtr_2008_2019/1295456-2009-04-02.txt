Table of Contents Prospectus Summary 5 Risk Factors 7 We are a new business with a limited operating history and no revenues as of November 30, 2008 and are not likely to succeed unless we can overcome the many obstacles we face. If we fail to overcome these obstacles you may lose your entire investment. 7 We have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit and we expect future losses that may cause our stock value to decline and result in you losing a portion or all of your investment. 8 Inability of our Officer and Directors to devote sufficient time to the operation of our business may limit our success. 8 We may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors and this may cause our stock value to decline. 8 We may become liable for defects or licensing issues that arise in the Commguard digital security products and this could negatively effect our business. 9 Because our Director and Officer owns the majority of our company's common stock, he has the ability to override the interests of the other stockholders. 9 We will require additional capital and financing to continue our business and failure to obtain capital would cause our business to fail. 9 Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 9 Purchasers in this offering may experience dilution, and if the market does not value our stock price higher than what you paid, you will have a negative return on your investment. 10 There is no liquidity and no established public market for our common stock and it may prove impossible to sell your shares. 10 Our Articles of Incorporation allow for our Board of Directors to issue our authorized Preferred Stock of 10,000,000 shares in one or more series and any new series may be granted rights greater than the Common Shares being offered in this prospectus. 10 If the selling shareholders sell a large number of shares all at once or in blocks, the value of our shares would most likely decline. 10 Our common stock is subject to the "penny stock" rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock. 11 Use of Proceeds 11 Determination of Offering Price 12 Selling Shareholders 12 Plan of Distribution 15 Legal Proceedings 17 Directors, Executive Officers, Promoters and Control Persons 18 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 19 Description of Securities 19 Interest of Named Experts and Counsel 21 Disclosure of Commission Position of Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities 21 Organization Within Last Five Years 22 Description of Business 22 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 28 Description of Property 31 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 31 Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters 32 Executive Compensation 33 Financial Statements Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 34 Prospectus Summary Secure Digital, Inc. is a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 28, 2004 as Quadra Ventures, Inc. whose principal executive offices are located in Lynden Washington. Our principal business is the production, marketing and sales via the Internet of digital security products called Commguard. About Our Business Secure Digital, Inc. is a Nevada based company focused on creating and marketing solutions for a range of business and consumer oriented Internet security problems. The Company's solutions are founded on its ability to provide digital certificate services, in a low-cost, easy to use manner. Digital certificates are used for digital signatures, authentication of devices or people, web site security and encryption. Digital Certificates allow Internet and electronic commerce users to digitally sign documents and authenticate themselves much as they would in person. The Company will compete in a segment of the Internet security market referred to as PKI  Public Key Infrastructure. PKI vendors attempt to address Internet security issues, providing a means for authentication and encryption. We are in the business of providing data and communications security solutions embodied as both products and services, which more particularly address Internet communication security and privacy. Our business model is to produce a version of the Commguard digital security products that is downloadable and runs under Microsoft Windows. We will market and sell these downloadable security solutions via our website on the Internet at www.securedigitalsecuritysolutions.com, which is currently under construction. We did not develop the Commguard digital security products ourselves, the Commguard digital security products were developed by Commguard Inc. We acquired the Commguard digital security products in its entirety on July 18, 2007 from Commguard Inc. for the purchase price of $500,000 shares of our common stock.

Risk Factors An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following known material risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this prospectus in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our company's common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following known material risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. We are a new business with a limited operating history and no revenues as of November 30, 2008 and are not likely to succeed unless we can overcome the many obstacles we face. If we fail to overcome these obstacles you may lose your entire investment. We are a development-stage company with limited prior business operations and no revenues. We commenced our operations on January 28, 2004. We are presently engaged in the production, marketing and sales of Commguard digital security products. Unless we are able to secure adequate funding, we may not be able to successfully continue production and market the Commguard digital security products and our business will most likely fail. Because of our limited operating history, you may not have adequate information on which you can base an evaluation of our business and prospects. To date, we have done the following: Completed organizational activities; · Developed a business plan; · Obtained interim funding; · Engaged consultants for professional services; · Produced an initial version of Commguard ; 7 In order to establish ourselves as an owner and distributor of Commguard digital security products, we are dependent upon continued funding and the successful production, marketing and sales of the Commguard digital security products. Failure to obtain funding for continued production and marketing would result in us having difficulty establishing sales or achieving profitability. You should be aware of the increased risks, uncertainties, difficulties and expenses we face as a development stage company and our business may fail and you may lose your entire investment. We have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit and we expect future losses that may cause our stock value to decline and result in you losing a portion or all of your investment. Since our inception on January 28, 2004 to November 30, 2008, we have incurred net losses of $69,674. We expect to lose more money as we spend additional capital to continue to produce and market the Commguard digital security products, and establish our infrastructure and organization to support anticipated operations. We cannot be certain whether we will ever earn a significant amount of revenues or profit, or, if we do, that we will be able to continue earning such revenues or profit. Also, any economic weakness may limit our ability to continue development and ultimately market our products and services. Any of these factors could cause our stock price to decline and result in you losing a portion or all of your investment. Inability of our Officer and Director to devote sufficient time to the operation of our business may limit our success. Presently our sole Officer and Director of our company, allocates only a portion of his time to the operation of our business. Should our business develop faster than anticipated, our sole officer and director may not be able to devote sufficient time to the operation of the business to ensure that it continues as a going concern. Even if this lack of sufficient time of our management is not fatal to our existence it may result in limited growth and success of the business. We may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors and this may cause our stock value to decline. Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively with the Commguard digital security products. Some of our potential competitors are well established and have larger customer bases and far better name recognition. If we do not compete effectively with current and future competitors we may not generate enough revenue to be profitable. Any of these factors could cause our stock price to decline and result in you losing a portion or all of your investment. 8 We may become liable for defects that arise in the Commguard digital security products and this could negatively effect our business. Since we will be selling Commguard digital security products in a downloadable format via our website, we may become liable for any defects that exist in the Commguard digital security products that may arise, such as, but not limited to, trademark, patent and copyright disputes. If we are deemed to be liable for any defects, this may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. Because our Director and Officer owns the majority of our company's common stock, he has the ability to override the interests of the other stockholders. Our President owns 54.61% of our outstanding common stock and serves as our sole Officer. Investors may find the corporate decisions influenced by our President are inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. Sale of your shares may be difficult or impossible as there is presently no demand or public market for our common stock. There is presently no demand or public market for our common stock. Though we intend to apply for a quotation on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board, we cannot guarantee that our application will be approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. Our common stock has no prior market and resale of your shares may be difficult without considerable delay or impossible. We will require additional capital and financing to continue our business and failure to obtain capital would cause our business to fail. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As discussed in the Notes of our November 30, 2008 financial statements, we are in the development stage of operations, have had losses from operations since inception, nominal revenues and insufficient working capital available to meet ongoing financial obligations over the next fiscal year. Our Auditor has raised substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, or in other words remain in business. We will require additional capital and financing in order to continue otherwise our business will fail. We have made no definitive arrangements for any additional capital or financing. Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, we were incorporated on January 28, 2004, and we do not have a history of earnings, and as a result, our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Continued operations are dependent on our ability to complete equity or debt financings or generate profitable operations. Such financings may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 9 Purchasers in this offering may experience dilution, and if the market does not value our stock price higher than what you paid, you will have a negative return on your investment. Since earlier investors in our company have paid average purchase prices less than $0.03 per share you may experience dilution of your investment. Our business will have to grow or the market must value the price of your shares higher than the amount that you paid for you to achieve a profit on your investment. If the valuation of our shares does not overcome your dilution you will lose a portion or all of your investment. There is no liquidity and no established public market for our common stock and it may prove impossible to sell your shares. There is presently no public market in our shares. While we intend to contact an authorized Over the Counter Bulletin Board market maker for sponsorship of our securities, we cannot guarantee that such sponsorship will be approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. Even if our shares are quoted for sale, buyers may be insufficient in numbers to allow for a robust market to develop and may prove impossible to sell your shares. Our Articles of Incorporation allow for our Board of Directors to issue our authorized Preferred Stock of 10,000,000 shares in one or more series and any new series may be granted rights greater than the Common Shares being offered in this prospectus. Our Articles of Incorporation allow for our Board of Directors to issue our authorized preferred stock of 10,000,000 shares in one or more series, with such voting powers, designations, preference and rights or qualifications, limitations or restrictions. This means that without further shareholder approval a new share series could be authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors which may be granted rights and preferences that are greater than those of the common shares being offered pursuant to this prospectus. If the selling shareholders sell a large number of shares all at once or in blocks, the value of our shares would most likely decline. The selling shareholders are offering 8,312,500 shares of our common stock through this prospectus. They must sell these shares at a fixed price of $0.06 until such time as they are quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board or other quotation system or stock exchange. Our common stock is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange, but should a market develop, shares sold at a price below the current market price at which the common stock is trading will cause that market price to decline. Moreover, the offer or sale of large numbers of shares at any price may cause the market price to fall. The outstanding shares of common stock covered by this prospectus represent approximately 45.39 % of the common shares currently outstanding. 10 Our common stock is subject to the "penny stock" rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a "penny stock," for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks; and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction . Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the "penny stock" rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Forward-Looking Statements This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. You should not place too much reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus. Use of Proceeds The company will not receive any proceeds from this offering 11 Determination of Offering Price The offering price was determined by using a number of factors. We determined the offering price by assessing our capital requirements against the price investors were willing to pay for our common stock and the speculative nature of our business being in the development stage. Selling Shareholders The selling shareholders are offering up to 8,312,500 shares of common stock through this prospectus. These shares were acquired from us in private placements that were exempt from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933.

Subsequently, on June 25, 2007 the company completed a reverse split on a 2-1 basis bringing the total common shares held by our selling shareholders to 7,812,500. On July 18, 2007 we issued 500,000 common shares to Commguard, Inc. as payment for acquiring their digital security products bringing the total of common shares offered by the selling shareholders to 8,312,500. The shares were sold solely by our previous Directors and Officers to their close friends and close business associates under exemptions provided under Regulation S.

Brokers or dealers who acquire shares as principals may thereafter resell such shares from time to time in transactions in a market or on an exchange, in negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices, and in connection with such re-sales may pay or receive commissions to or from the purchasers of such shares. These transactions may involve cross and block transactions that may involve sales to and through other brokers or dealers. If applicable, the selling shareholders may distribute shares to one or more of their partners who are unaffiliated with us. Such partners may, in turn, distribute such shares as described above. We can provide no assurance that all or any of the common stock offered will be sold by the selling shareholders. We are bearing all costs relating to the registration of the common stock owned by the selling shareholders. The selling shareholders, however, will pay any commissions or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the common stock. The selling shareholders must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in the offer and sale of the common stock. In particular, during such times as the selling shareholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and may, among other things: 1. Not engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our common stock; 2. Furnish each broker or dealer through which common stock may be offered, such copies of this prospectus, as amended from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer; and 3. Not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities other than as permitted under the Securities Exchange Act. The Securities Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). 16 The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, which: contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties; contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including "bid" and "ask" prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and contains such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size, and format) as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation; The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to proceeding with any transaction in a penny stock, the customer: with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; details of the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities.

Audit Committee Financial Expert We do not have a financial expert serving on an audit committee to assist in the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) from our bank statements and invoices. We do not have an audit committee at this time because we have no revenue. 18 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management The following table sets forth, as of the date of this registration statement, the number of shares of Common Stock owned of record and beneficially by executive officers, directors and persons who hold 5.0% or more of the outstanding Common Stock of Secure Digital, Inc.. Also included are the shares held by our Director and Officer. Title of Class Name and Address of Beneficial Owner Number of Shares Owned Beneficially Percent of Class Owned Prior To This Offering 855 Hinotes Court Lynden Washington Common Stock $0.001 par value Peter Jongema Director, President and Secretary 10,000,000 54.61% Title of Class Security Ownership of Management Number of Shares Owned Beneficially Percent of Class Owned Prior To This Offering Common Stock $0.001 par value Directors and Officers as a group (one person) 10,000,000 54.61% The percent of class is based on 18,312,500 of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. The person listed is the sole Director and Officer of our company and have full voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a person (or a group of persons) is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if he or she, directly or indirectly, has or shares power to vote or to direct the voting of such security. Accordingly, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has the right to acquire within 60 days, such as options or warrants to purchase our common stock. Description of Securities Common Stock The Articles of Incorporation of Secure Digital, Inc., authorize the issuance of 125,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 par value. Each holder of record of common stock is entitled to 1 vote for each share held on all matters properly submitted to the stockholders for their vote. The Articles of Incorporation as amended do not permit cumulative voting for the election of directors. Holders of common stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, holders are entitled to receive, ratably, the net assets available to stockholders after distribution is made to the preferred shareholders, if any. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, conversion or redemptive rights. If additional shares of our common stock are issued, the relative interests of then existing stockholders will be diluted. Our Articles of Incorporation allow for our Board of Directors to issue authorized common stock of 125,000,000 shares in one or more series, with such voting powers, designations, preference and rights or qualifications, limitations or restrictions. 19 This means that without further shareholder approval a new share series could be authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors which may be granted rights and preferences that are greater than those of the common shares the have currently been issued. Our counsel, Joseph I. Emas has reviewed our share issuances and is of the opinion that all issued shares are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable pursuant to the corporate law of the State of Nevada. (Chapter 78A of the Nevada Revised Statues). We are currently engaged with Holladay Stock Transfer as our transfer agent, and plan to have them continue to serve in that capacity until such time as management believes it is necessary or in order to facilitate the creation of a public trading market for its securities. Should our securities be quoted on any exchange or OTC quotation system or application is made to have the securities quoted, an independent transfer agent is necessary. We currently have,18,312,500 shares of our common stock at $0.001 par value outstanding of which 8,312,500 shares are owned by non-affiliate shareholders and 10,000,000 shares that are owned by our Directors and Officers who are affiliates. Preferred Stock Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001. Our board of directors is authorized to issue the preferred stock from time to time in series and is further authorized to establish such series, to fix and determine the variations in the relative rights and preferences as between series, to fix voting rights, if any, for each series, and to allow for the conversion of preferred stock into common stock. No preferred stock has been issued to date. Non-Affiliate Owned Securities We have issued 8,312,500shares of our common stock at $0.001 par value to non-affiliate non-US shareholders acquired from us in offerings that were exempt from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. These 8,312,500 shares are all being registered for resale by the selling shareholders via this registration statement. Affiliate Owned Securities We issued 10,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Jongema at $0.001 per share for total consideration of $10,000 on March 28, 2008. As of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Jongema owns 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. Mr. Jongema is an affiliate of our company. Under the Securities Act of 1933, these shares can only be re-sold under the provisions of Rule 144. When a person acquires restricted securities or holds control securities, he or she must find an exemption from the SEC's registration requirements to sell them in the marketplace. Rule 144 allows public resale of restricted and control securities if a number of conditions are met. Restricted securities are securities acquired in unregistered, private sales from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer. Investors typically receive restricted securities through private placement offerings, Regulation S offerings, employee stock benefit plans, as compensation for professional services, or in exchange for providing "seed money" or start-up capital to a company. 20 Under Rule 144 a shareholder, including an affiliate of our company, may sell shares of common stock after at least one year has elapsed since such shares were acquired from us or an affiliate of our company. Rule 144 further restricts the number of shares of common stock which may be sold within any three-month period to the greater of one percent of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume in the common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the date on which notice of such sale was filed under Rule 144. Certain other requirements of Rule 144 concerning availability of public information, manner of sale and notice of sale must also be satisfied. In addition, a shareholder who is not an affiliate of our company, and who has not been an affiliate of our company for 90 days prior to the sale, and who has beneficially owned shares acquired from our company or an affiliate of our company for over two years ma y resell the shares of common stock without compliance with the foregoing requirements under Rule 144. Debt Securities As of the date of this registration statement, we do not have any debt securities. Other Securities As of the date of this registration statement, we do not have any other securities such as warrants or stock options. Interest of Named Experts and Counsel No expert or counsel named in this prospectus as having prepared or certified any part of this prospectus or having given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered or upon other legal matters in connection with the registration or offering of the common stock was employed on a contingency basis, or had, or is to receive, in connection with the offering, a substantial interest exceeding $50,000, direct or indirect, in the registrant or any of its parents or subsidiaries. Nor was any such person connected with the registrant or any of its parents or subsidiaries as a promoter, managing or principal underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, or employee. Joseph I. Emas, our independent legal counsel, has provided an opinion on the validity of our common stock. The financial statements included in this prospectus have been audited by Jewett, Schwartz, Wolfe and Associates of Hollywood Florida to the extent and for the periods set forth in their report appearing elsewhere herein, and are included in reliance upon such report given upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting. Disclosure of Commission Position of Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the Company pursuant to provisions of the State of Nevada, the Company has been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in that Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 21 Organization Within Last Five Years We were incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA on January 28, 2004 under the name of Quadra Ventures, Inc. and in January of 2006 we changed our name to Secure Digital, Inc. Our previous business was a software program called Force Field, a program designed to prevent un wanted intruders from accessing websites. In September of 2005 we abandoned this program due to the obsolescence of the software and its limited applications. On June 22, 2007, Peter Jongema was officially appointed as our Director, President, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer. Our fiscal year end has been established to be November 30. Our current operations are based in Lynden Washington. The reason that we incorporated in Nevada is because if we are able to increase our sales and profitability to a significant level, will then move our operations to Nevada so that we can take advantage of Nevada's corporate state tax rates. Effective July 18, 2007 we entered into an agreement and acquired the prior development, designs and implementation of Commguard Inc. in consideration for a purchase price of $500,000 common shares. We have registered the Internet domain name www.securedigitalsecuritysolutions.com. Our website is currently under construction and anticipate completion on or before April 30, 2009. We are a development stage company. Our principal business is the production, marketing and sales the Commguard digital security products. Our statutory registered agent's office is located at 8257 S. Eastern Avenue, Suite 200 Las Vegas, Nevada, 89123 and our business office is located at 855 Hinotes Court Lynden, WA 98264, our telephone number is 360-540-2241 . We have not had any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding since incorporation. There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation. Description of Business Business Development We were incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA on January 28, 2004 and are based in Lynden Washington. We have not had any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding since incorporation. There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation. We will not seek a merger or acquisition within the next twelve months and we have a specific business plan to execute. Business of Issuer We are a development stage company. Our plan is to commercialize solutions for a range of business and consumer oriented Internet security problems. We are in the early marketing stages for our products application and infrastructure build out, and have not as yet engaged in revenue producing activities. We provide products and services to enable an enterprise's staff to more effectively manage and share information, customer relations, service and support activities, marketing and document or data management. 22 Our objective is to complete pre-marketing activities and to actively market and support a commercial product and to earn revenues from business or other organizations worldwide via the Internet from our website at www.securedigitalsecuritysolutions.com. Our sources of revenue will come from subscriptions for our products, product licensing fees and through support service charges and fees. The Company's solutions are founded on its ability to provide digital certificate services, in a low-cost, easy to use manner. Digital certificates are used for digital signatures, authentication of devices or people, web site security and encryption. Digital Certificates allow Internet and electronic commerce users to digitally sign documents and authenticate themselves much as they would in person. The Company competes in a segment of the Internet security market referred to as PKI  Public Key Infrastructure. PKI vendors attempt to address Internet security issues, providing a means for authentication and encryption. Although PKIs foundation is technical in nature  a form of encryption known as public key encryption - PKI based solutions also encompass people, policies, procedures and facilities to bind user names to electronic keys so that applications can provide the desired security services. Industry Background The Internet has proven to be an extraordinary medium for communication, data transmissions and for e-commerce. However, by itself, the Internet does not provide users with security, privacy or the ability to know who you are dealing with is the person you thought you were dealing with. the Internet provides hackers, snoops and thief's with a easy opportunity to access your private information and worse to destroy or alter your valuable business assets. In addition, theft of proprietary and confidential corporate information and data is commonplace, both by insiders and sophisticated fraudsters. In addition, the risk of industrial espionage is real. Information security is now a major issue facing todays electronic society. As the information highway transcends borders, locked doors are no longer sufficient to protect one of the corporations most valuable assets information. Examples are: E-mail communications - Unsecured e-mail is often referred to as equivalent to a post card. Anyone can read it. Unlike a post card, your unsecured e-mail, receives none of the protections afforded by the post office. Identity on the Internet - It is easy to spoof a person's e-mail address and send an e-mail that looks for all purposes to have been sent from a known person. The recipient can never be certain if the e-mail was really sent from the person it was purported to be from. Privacy of your data and networks - If your laptop or your files are unsecured, your files and private information may be accessed by an outsider via the Internet or by someone who steals your laptop or other computing device or even by a co-worker. If your files are secured they are not readable or usable by anyone other then yourself. Information security is needed to protect valuable and private data and communications. We also need digital signatures and identities to have validity in identifying persons for legally binding transactions and for definitive non-repudiation. Unless there is the same level of confidence and trust in the Internet as exists in the traditional marketplace, global e-commerce, communications and data transfers will not realize their true potential. In an electronic world, the transactors or exchangers do not have the assurance of physical interaction. Electronic communications can also be intercepted in transit and the content changed or manipulated Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) was developed to address these needs and provides the framework and trust infrastructure necessary for Internet security. 23 Public Key Infrastructure or PKI Throughout time, people have developed ways to ensure that a communication was sent by the proported person, was not intercepted and never delivered, was altered or just read or copied and the sender know that the recipient actually received it. The common trait to many solutions included the use of both ciphers and codes which rely upon a shared secret such as a method or codebook. The secret must be known by both parties in order to be effective; the requirement to communicate the secret is a weakness of such systems. The resulting solutions are known collectively as cryptographic systems, and the art and science of hiding information is called cryptography. To transform a message so as to hide or scramble its content is to encrypt it. The recipient must then decrypt the message before it can be read. Simple (symmetrical cryptographic solutions) provide for a single key that both the sender and recipient must have. This results in a weakness in these systems due to the necessity for both parties to share a single key. Public key cryptography (or asymmetric cryptography) replaces the secret key with a pair of keys, one private and one public, both mathematically linked one to the other. Information is encrypted with the public key, which can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key from that key pair, providing proof of confidentiality. In this system, the public keys of all users can be published in open directories, facilitating communications between all parties. The private key is not shared, only the public key is made public. Public key cryptography can also be used to create and verify digital signatures. These can be appended to messages to provide proof of authentication, integrity and non repudiation. In addition to Public key cryptography's mathematical cyphers and codes, a PKI system includes: Security policies to define the rules under which the cryptographic systems should operate; Products to generate, store and manage the keys; and Procedures to dictate how the keys and certificates should be generated, distributed and used. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). PKI provides the core framework for a wide variety of components, applications, policies and practices to combine and achieve the four principal security functions for commercial transactions: Confidentiality - to keep information private Integrity - to prove that information has not been manipulated Authentication - to prove the identity of an individual or application Non-repudiation - to ensure that information cannot be disowned The Components of a PKI A Public Key Infrastructure is a combination of hardware and software products, policies and procedures. It provides the basic security required so that users, who do not know each other, or are widely distributed, can communicate securely through a chain of trust. PKI is based on digital IDs known as digital certificates which act like electronic passports, and bind the users digital signature to his or her public key. A PKI consists of: A Security Policy Certificate Authority (CA) Registration Authority (RA) Certificate Distribution System PKI-enabled Applications 24 Security Policy - A security policy sets out and defines an organizations top-level direction on information security, as well as the processes and principles for the use of cryptography. Typically it will include statements on how the organization will handle keys and valuable information, and will set the level of control required to match the levels of risk. These s policies and procedures are set out in the Certificate Practice Statement (CPS). Certificate Authority (CA) - The CA system is the trust basis of a PKI. The CA manages public key certificates for their whole life cycle, including: Issuing certificates by binding the identity of a user or device to a public key with a digital signature; Scheduling expiry dates for certificates; and Ensuring certificates are revoked when necessary through the publication of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). When implementing a PKI, an organization can either operate its own CA system, or use the CA service of a Commercial CA or Trusted Third Party. Registration Authority (RA) - An RA provides the interface between the user and the CA. It captures and authenticates the identity of the users and submits the certificate request to the CA. The quality of this authentication process determines the level of trust that can be placed in the certificates. Certificate Distribution System - Certificates can be distributed in a number of ways depending on the structure of the PKI environment, for example, by the users themselves, or through a directory service. A directory server may already exist within an organization or one may be supplied as part of the PKI solution. PKI-enabled applications - A PKI is a means to an end, providing the security framework by which PKI-enabled applications can be confidently deployed to achieve the end benefits. Examples of applications are: Communications between web servers and browsers E-mail Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Credit card transactions over the Internet Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Third Party Authentication Third party authentication provides the final piece of PKI and provides public key trust. It is necessary in all cryptographic systems to establish a trust relationship of some kind before secure communication starts. In the simple symmetric system, the trust relationship is the fact that two parties have trusted each other with a shared secret. In an asymmetric model, the trust relationship is the knowledge of the source and the integrity of the public key. A digital signature applied to the public key will achieve this and in PKI the signer is a third party who certifies the integrity of the public key and packages it for easy distribution. Certificate Validity Good security practices require periodic revalidation of trust relationships. In order to facilitate this, digital IDs have a validity period before and after which they cannot be used. 25 Products and Services Digital Certificates Delivers digital certificates for individuals, businesses and other organizations or groups. The Company offers two levels of digital certificates, a non validated digital certificate and a validated digital certificate. Non validated digital certificates are issued to a firm's clients where validation of identity is not essential as it is controlled by the firm. Validated digital certificates are issued only to validated or authenticated individuals or organizations. Validation or authentication of a person is based on identification of the person or organization proven by submission of documents, personal presence and notarized validation provides recipients with assurance of identity in transactions of value including where digital proof of identity is required. Secure Digital uses RAs to provide validation or proof of identity of a person within its Trust Network. RAs provide the function of validating identities through documents, personal presence and notarized validation. The reliability of a person's digital identification is dependent on the validation procedures of the RA. Managed PKI Provides business and other organizations with the ability to manage their PKI needs for e-mail communication and web site authentication. Our managed PKI is ready to use and provides trusted clients with easy to use tools for enrollment, validation, and issuance of certificates. These firms appoint one or more individuals to serve as administrator(s), with full authority to approve, renew, reject, and administer certificates. An organizations end-users interact with our web-based delivery system to receive and enable the digital certificates. Once approved by an organization's Administrator, Secure Digital issues certificates immediately or as is otherwise set out in the services agreement. The benefits of managed PKI include: Local management - Each Administrator has complete control over the issuance, rejection and revocation of digital certificates. Easy to use administrative - .We provide a user friendly Web based system with reports. Administrator's can monitor the full cycle of certificate management cycle. Rapid turn-around  Secure Data issues certificates as set out in our services agreement for the type of certificate. Customizable - Managed PKI services can be customized to meet our client's needs. E Commerce We have selected PayPal as our online transaction provider. PayPal is located on the Internet at http://www.paypal.com and is a popular transaction provider. This means that our future customers will have the ability to pay us for Commguard digital security products and we will not be required to maintain confidential information such as our customer's credit card numbers on our servers. PayPal charges us approximately a 3% transaction fee for every transaction that they clear for us. 26 Competition Regarding our competitive position in the industry, we are a new entry into this marketplace and we are not well known. We will compete with numerous providers of online or Internet accessible applications and services companies, many of which have far greater financial and other resources than we do. Many of these companies have established histories and relationships in providing online applications or systems that enable them to attract talent, marketing support, and financing. Moreover, proven track records are of paramount consideration in selecting vendors. We expect that we are currently behind our competitors in terms of revenue, brand awareness and market share. Our major competitor in this field is Verisign. We believe our products will be competitive in the market place and with potential customers as our products are full featured and fully integrated while requiring only minimal customization. The use of our products do not require extensive training and does not require add on components from third party developers. We believe that our products will prove to be cost effective and easy for users to adopt and use. We also plan to market our products and services through channel partners and resellers, to broaden our exposure to customers and users. While our management team has significant business experience, we, as a company, have no proven track record in the software or online services industry. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully market our systems or compete within this industry. Intellectual Property We have no patents, trademarks, franchises, concessions or labor contracts at this time, however, we are in the process of making application for trademarks in Canada and the United States and in the future other jurisdictions, and have no assurance of our ability to continue to use such names in association with the sale of our products and services. In the future we will enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information and will apply for other protections in the form of patents and copyrights if applicable, in order to fully protect our proprietary software. Failure to provide adequate protection our proprietary rights could expose us to infringement of our rights by other parties and could offer similar services, significantly harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenues. Government Approvals We currently do not require approval of any government to offer our products and services. We do not expect that will be any governmental regulations on our business. We are voluntarily not accepting orders from the following countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea [North Korea], Eritrea, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [Serbia and Montenegro], Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar [Burma], Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Syria, and Sudan. We expect no costs or effects of compliance of federal, state and local environmental laws on our business. Employees We have one part-time employee, our President, Mr. Jongema who dedicates 20 hours per week to our business. 27 Reports to Security Holders We are not required to deliver an annual report to security holders. However, we intend to voluntarily send an annual report to security holders and this annual report will include audited financial statements. This prospectus and exhibits will be contained in a Form S-1 registration statement that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will become a reporting company after this prospectus has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a reporting company we will file quarterly, annual, beneficial ownership and other reports with the SEC. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information from the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Since we are an electronic filer, the easiest way to access our reports is through the SEC's Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Plan of Operation Financial Plan As of November 30, 2008 we had a cash balance $ 10,076 and have earned no revenue from operations. Since our inception on January 28, 2004 to November 30, 2008 we have raised $64,750 in equity financing via distributions of unregistered securities to Canadian investors using exemptions provided under Regulation S and under Multilateral Instrument 45-103 Part 2 in Canada. During the next twelve months we will need additional funds and we are seeking these additional funds via, private placements or loans from our sole officer and director or current shareholders or potentially an initial public offering. No arrangements for additional funds have been completed. We anticipate that a nominal amount of revenue will be earned during our second quarter as our website is currently under construction. Offering costs During the next twelve month period we anticipate spending $10,000 on Legal fees, fees and SEC Registration Fees; $16,500 on Accounting and Auditing; $2,500 on Electronic Filing and Printing and $1,000 on Transfer agent Fees. Product Development Plan Effective July 18, 2007 we entered into an agreement and acquired the prior development, designs and implementation of Commguard Inc. in consideration for a purchase price of $500,000 common shares. We have registered the Internet domain name www.securedigitalsecuritysolutions.com. Our website is currently under construction and anticipate completion on or before April 30, 2009. We are a development stage company. Our principal business is the production, marketing and sales the Commguard digital security products. Our plan is to commercialize solutions for a range of business and consumer oriented Internet security problems. We are in the early marketing stages for our products application and infrastructure build out, and have not as yet engaged in revenue producing act ivities. 28 We will provide products and services to enable an enterprise's staff to more effectively manage and share information, customer relations, service and support activities, marketing and document or data management.

The Company's solutions are founded on its ability to provide digital certificate services, in a low-cost, easy to use manner. Digital certificates are used for digital signatures, authentication of devices or people, web site security and encryption. Since our acquisition, management has continued to implement our business plan. We have focused our limi ted resources to test the installation and usability of our products. We will maintain a test and demonstration implementation of our products, which will be maintained on our servers that will be situated at a data hosting service in the US. Our business plan can be summarized in four principal categories as outlined below. We estimate the development period required to complete a commercial implementation of the Commguard products and develop commercial sales would be four months at an estimated cost of $7,000. At present we do not have sufficient funds to engage additional employees or contractors to quicken the implementation of our business plan. While we have limited funding and are in the preliminary state of commercialization of our products and services, management believes it can successfully implement the plan without significant additional funding. We have no intent or plan to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies. Website Development Plan The development of our website is currently under construction and anticipate being online on April of 2009. Development of our website is being conducted by Management with the cost of the website development anticipated at about $2,000.Our website will be located on the Internet at www.securedigitalsecuritysolutions.com. Our website will allow our customers to purchase online as well as try out the product prior to purchasing. Customers will be able select either US or Canadian funds to pay for their purchase. We will offer payment options by check/money order or PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service owned by eBay Inc. PayPal's website is located on the Internet at http://www.paypal.com . Once completed we do not anticipate having to develop our website further within the next twelve months. Website Hosting Plan Our website will be hosted by Network Solutions and will be charging us approximately $15 per month to host our website. Over the next twelve months the cost of hosting our website will be $180. Marketing Plan We intend to market our website using Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a way to purchase highly targeted cost-per-click advertising. AdWords ads are displayed along with search results on Google, as well as on search and content sites in an ad network operated by Google Inc. a leader on Internet search. We estimate this cost to be estimated at $20,000 for the next year. Additionally, we will implement our demonstration systems and survey user and market acceptance of our products in order to target potential customers. 29 Purchase Plan Once Commguard digital security products are ready for sale, purchasers may download it directly from our website. Upon receipt of the purchase price, the purchaser will be issued a product key code (license) to activate their product. Commguard Obsolescence Plan As of the date of this registration statement, we will be able to distribute Commguard digital security products. Being web based downloadable products, does not represent a serious risk of obsolescence due to the fact that any updated products would be available to our customers to download through our website. Development Costs During the next twelve months we anticipate spending $2,000 on website development with completion anticipated April 30, 2009; $7,000 on further development with completion anticipated during the summer of 2009; Marketing in the amount of $20,000 with commencement estimated in September 2009; and website hosting at a cost of $180 per annum, for a total of $29,180 in business expenditures for the year. Accounting and Audit Plan We intend to continue to have our outside consultant assist in the preparation of our quarterly and annual financial statements and have these financial statements reviewed or audited by our independent auditor. We anticipate $500 to assist in the preparation of our quarterly financial statements and $1,000 to assist in the preparation of our annual financial statements.

In the next twelve months, we anticipate spending approximately $20,500 to pay for our accounting and audit requirements. SEC Filing Plan We intend to become a reporting company in 2009 after our S-1 is declared effective. This means that we will file documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. We expect to incur filing costs of approximately $750 per quarter to support our quarterly and annual filings. In the next twelve months, we anticipate spending approximately $5,000 for legal costs to pay for three quarterly filings, one annual filing, a 424B3 final prospectus filing, and a Form 8-A filing in order to complete registration our common stock. Results of Operations We have had no operating revenues since our inception on January 28, 2004 through to November 30, 2008.

(A Development Stage Company) November 30, 2008 Index Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm F 2 Balance Sheet F 3 Statement of Operations F 4 Statement of Cash Flows F 5 Statement of Stockholders Equity F 6 Notes to the Financial Statements F 7-18 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Secure Digital, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Secure Digital, Inc. (a Development Stage Company) as of November 30, 2008 and 2007 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended and from January 26, 2004 (inception) through November 30, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provided a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Secure Digital, Inc. as of November, 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended and the period from January 26, 2004 (inception) through November 30, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accompanying financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Companys need to seek new sources or methods of financing or revenue to pursue its business strategy, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans as to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

(A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS Secure Digital Inc (Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 28, 2004. The Company was organized to develop software and IT applications in North America. NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN These financial statements are presented on the basis that the Company is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. As of November 30, 2008, the Company had $10,076 in cash, working capital of $10,076, and stockholders equity of $10,076 and accumulated net losses of $69,674 since inception. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Its continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required, to develop commercially viable software and IT applicati ons , and ultimately to establish profitable operations. Management's plans for the continuation of the Company as a going concern include financing the Company's operations through issuance of its common stock. If the Company is unable to complete its financing requirements or achieve revenue as projected, it will then modify its expenditures and plan of operations to coincide with the actual financing completed and actual operating revenues. There are no assurances, however, with respect to the future success of these plans. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in these notes to the financial statements pertain to continuing operations. The Company is not currently earning any revenues. NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in United States (US) dollars. The Company has not produced any revenue from its principal business and is a development stage company as defined by the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 7 Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises. -F7- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of these financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Impaired Asset Policy The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets when applicable to determine if any events or changes in circumstances have transpired which indicate that the carrying value of its assets may not be recoverable, pursuant to guidance established in SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets" (SFAS 144). The Company determines impairment by comparing the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by its assets to their respective carrying amounts. If impairment is deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value. Start-up Expenses The Company has adopted Statement of Position No. 98-5 (SOP 98-5), "Reporting the Costs of Start-up Activities," which requires that costs associated with start-up activities be expensed as incurred. Accordingly, start-up costs associated with the Company's formation have been included in the Company's general and administrative expenses for the period from inception on January 26, 2004 to November 30, 2008. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the year end and capital accounts are translated at historical rates. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included in the Comprehensive Income statement account in stockholders equity, if applicable. There were no translation adjustments as of November 30, 2008. Transactions undertaken in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated using the exchange rate in effect as of the transaction date. If applicable, exchange gains and losses are included in other items on the statement of operations. There were no exchange gains or losses as of November 30, 2008. -F8- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock options issued to employees in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant as the excess of current market price of the underlying stock over the exercise price. Such compensation amounts are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, which allows entities to provide pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma earnings (loss) per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair-valued based method defined in SFAS No. 123 has been applied. The Company accounts for stock options or warrants issued to non-employees for goods or services in accordance with the fair value method of SFAS 123. Under this method, the Company records an expense equal to the fair value of the options or warrants issued. The fair value is computed using an options pricing model. Loss per Share The Company computed basic and diluted loss per share amounts for November 30, 2008 pursuant to the SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. There are no potentially dilutive shares outstanding and, accordingly, dilutive per share amounts have not been presented in the accompanying statements of operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, (SFAS 107) requires disclosures of information regarding the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value. For purpose of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale of liquidation. Comprehensive Loss SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income (SFAS 130) establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As of November 30, 2008 the Company has no items that represent comprehensive loss and therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in financial statements. -F9- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Taxes Income taxes are recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109), whereby deferred income tax liabilities or assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recent accounting pronouncements that the Company has adopted or will be required to adopt in the future are summarized below. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 addresses the requests from investors for expanded disclosure about the extent to which a company measures assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The Companys adoption of SFAS 157 did not affect its results of operations or financial position. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effects, if any, of applying FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and the Company adopted it in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. -F10- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06−3 (EITF 06-3), “How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation).” EITF 06−3 applies to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer. EITF 06−3 allows companies to present taxes either gross within revenue and expense or net. If taxes subject to this issue are significant, a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amount of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis. EITF 06−3 was adopted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Since the Company has not produced any revenue, no taxes have been collected. Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-1 (As Amended), Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FAS 13-1). This position requires a company to recognize as rental expense the rental costs associated with a ground or building operating lease during a construction period, except for costs associated with projects accounted for under SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. FAS 13-1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and was adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The Companys adoption of FAS 13-1 did not affect its results of operations and financial position. Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each on a company's balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures. The Company adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on its results of operations and financial condition. -F11- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FAS 123(R)-5 FSP FAS 123(R)-5 was issued on October 10, 2006. The FSP provides that instruments that were originally issued as employee compensation and then modified, and that modification is made to the terms of the instrument solely to reflect an equity restructuring that occurs when the holders are no longer employees, then no change in the recognition or the measurement (due to a change in classification) of those instruments will result if both of the following conditions are met: (a). There is no increase in fair value of the award (or the ratio of intrinsic value to the exercise price of the award is preserved, that is, the holder is made whole), or the antidilution provision is not added to the terms of the award in contemplation of an equity restructuring; and (b). All holders of the same class of equity instruments (for example, stock options) are treated in the same manner. The provisions in this FSP shall be applied in the first reporting period beginning after October 10, 2006, which is the date posted to the FASB website. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 123(R)-5 did not have a material impact on its results of operations and financial condition. Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 will become effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently evaluating what effects the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on the Companys future results of operations and financial condition. Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. The FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method. The FSP affects entities that accrue dividends on share-based payment awards during the awards service period when the dividends do not need to be returned if the employees forfeit the award. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on its financial position and results of operations. -F12- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an entity's Own Stock In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-5, "Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock" (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the instrument's contingent exercise and settlement provisions. It also clarifies on the impact of foreign currency denominated strike prices and market-based employee stock option valuation instruments on the evaluation. EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of EITF 07-5 on its financial position and results of operations. Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contractsan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60 In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 163, Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60. This statement requires that an insurance enterprise recognize a claim liability prior to an event of default (insured event) when there is evidence that credit deterioration has occurred in an insured financial obligation. SFAS 163 also clarifies how Statement 60 applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts, including the recognition and measurement to be used to account for premium revenue and claim liabilities to increase comparability in financial reporting of financial guarantee insurance contracts by insurance enterprises. SFAS 163 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and all interim periods within those fiscal years, except for some disclosures about the insurance enterprises risk-managemen t activities of the insurance enterprise are effective for the first period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance of SFAS 163. Except for those disclosures, earlier application is not permitted. Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement). The FSP clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion. The FSP requires issuers to account separately for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. -F13- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The FSP requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our statement of operations. The FSP requires retrospective application to the terms of instruments as they existed for all periods presented. The FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company currently has no convertible debt and does not expect that its adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have a material impact upon its financial statements. The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" (FAS No.162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets In April 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position on Financial Accounting Standard (FSP FAS) No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of intangible assets under SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of the expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) Business Combinations and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of FSP FAS No. 142-3 on its financial statements. Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,  Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , an amendment of SFAS No. 133, (SFAS 161). This statement requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of SFAS No. 161 on the Companys financial statements. Delay in Effective Date In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. This FSP delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact of adoption is not expected to be material to the Companys financial condition or results of operations. -F14- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). This Statement replaces the original SFAS No. 141. This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which SFAS No. 141 called the purchase method ) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The objective of SFAS No. 141(R) is to improve the relevance, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: · Recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. · Recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase. · Determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and may not be applied before that date. The Company is unable at this time to determine the effect that its adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its results of operations and financial condition. Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). This Statement amends the original Accounting Review Board (ARB) No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and may not be applied before that date. The Company is unable at this time to determine the effect that its adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. -F15- SECURE DIGITAL, INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of SFAS No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which becomes effective for the Company on February 1, 2008, permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses in earnings. Such accounting is optional and is generally to be applied instrument by instrument. The Company adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures. Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" (SFAS No. 154), which replaces Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections, and it establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adoption of SFAS No. 154 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 did not have a material impact on its results of operations and financial condition.

This exclusion of liability does not limit any right, which a director may have to be indemnified, and does not affect any director's liability under federal or applicable state securities laws. Disclosure of Commission position on Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the Company pursuant to provisions of the State of Nevada, the Company has been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in that Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 34 Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution The estimated costs of this offering are as follows: Legal Fees $10,000 Accounting and Auditing $16,500 Electronic Filing and Printing $2,500 Transfer Agent $1,000 Total $30,000 None of the above expenses of issuance and distribution will be borne by the selling shareholders.
