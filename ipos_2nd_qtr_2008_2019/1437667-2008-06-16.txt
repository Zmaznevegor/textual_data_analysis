Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this prospectus, before making an investment decision concerning the common stock. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMPANY The loss of our key officers and directors, Shailesh Shah and Bhupendra M. Bhatt, may raise substantial doubt as to the continued viability of eJobResource . eJobResource, Inc.s operations depend on the efforts of Shailesh Shah and Bhupendra M. Bhatt, the only officers and directors of eJobResource. Mr. Shailesh Shah currently works full time for eJobResource. Mr. Bhupendra M. Bhatt has no experience related to public company management, nor as a principal accounting officer, however Mr. Bhatt has extensive experience in business management and planning. Because of this, the loss of the services of either Mr. Shailesh Shah or Mr. Bhupendra M. Bhatt may irreparably harm the Company in such a manner that eJobResource cannot guarantee that it will be able to overcome any such loss in management. Purchasers in this offering will have limited control over decision making because Shailesh Shah, eJobResources officer, director, and shareholder controls 51% of eJobResource issued and outstanding common stock Presently, Shailesh Shah, eJobResources Director, President, Treasurer beneficially owns 51% of the outstanding common stock. Because of such ownership, investors in this offering will have limited control over matters requiring approval by eJobResource security holders, including the election of directors. Mr. Shailesh Shah would retain 51.00% ownership in eJobResource common stock assuming the minimum amount of shares of this offering is sold. In the event the maximum offering is attained, Mr. Shailesh Shah will own 47% of eJobResource outstanding common stock. Such concentrated control may also make it difficult for eJobResource stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of eJobResource common stock in the event eJobResource enters into transactions, which require stockholder approval. In addition, certain provisions of Nevada law could have the effect of making it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of eJobResource. For example, Nevada law provides that not less than two-thirds vote of the stockholders is required to remove a director for cause, which could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of the Board of Directors. This concentration of ownership limits the power to exercise control by the minority shareholders. Investors may lose their entire investment if eJobResource fails to implement its business plan . eJobResource expects to face substantial risks, uncertainties, expenses, and difficulties because it is a development-stage company. eJobResource was formed in Nevada on January 27, 2004. eJobResource has no demonstrable operations record of substance upon which you can evaluate eJobResources business and prospects. eJobResource prospects must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development. EJobResource cannot guarantee that it will be successful in accomplishing its objectives. As of the date of this prospectus, eJobResource has had only limited start-up operations and has generated minimal revenues. Considering these facts, independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about eJobResources ability to continue as a going concern in the independent auditors report to the financial statements included in the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part. In addition, eJobResources lack of operating capital could negatively affect the value of its common shares and could result in the loss of your entire investment. Because of our new business model, we have not proven our ability to generate profit, and any investment in eJobResource is risky . We have very little meaningful operating history so it will be difficult for you to evaluate an investment in our stock. Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure that we will ever be profitable. Since we have not proven the essential elements of profitable operations, you will be furnishing venture capital to us and will bear the risk of complete loss of your investment in the event we are not successful. 7 If we do not raise funds through this offering, it is unlikely that we can continue operations . As of March 31, 2008, we had assets of $11,723 and current liabilities of ($158,159). We are devoting substantially all of our present efforts to establishing a new business and need the proceeds from this offering to continue implementing our new business plan. We have not generated any income as of March 31, 2008 for the current fiscal year, and all revenue from year ending December 31, 2007, the first year under our current business model, was derived totally from a related party. If we cannot raise funds through this offering, we will have to seek other sources of financing or we will be forced to curtail or terminate our business. There is no assurance that additional sources of financing will be available at all or at a reasonable cost. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If our operating costs exceed our estimates, it may impact our ability to continue operations . We believe we have accurately estimated our needs for the next twelve months based on receipt of either the minimum or maximum amount of the offering. It is possible that we may need to purchase additional equipment or that our operating costs will be higher than estimated. If this happens, it may impact our ability to generate revenue and we would need to seek additional funding. We intend to establish our initial client base via existing relationships that our directors and officers have established in their past business relationships. Should these relationships not generate the anticipated volume of clientele, any unanticipated costs would diminish our working capital. Competitors with more resources may force us out of business . eJobResource has many potential competitors in the HR and ecommerce recruitment industry with respect to direct sales of PCs, computer parts, and other Information Technology products. We consider the competition is competent, experienced, and they have greater financial and technical, and marketing resources than we do at the present. Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development, sales, and marketing of their products and services than are available to us. Some of the Companys competitors also offer a wider range of services and products and have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases than the Company. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and customer requirements than the Company and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer terms that are more attractive to customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the Company. Moreover, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their services and products. The Company expects that new competitors or alliances among competitors have the potential to emerge and may acquire significant market share. eJobResource may not be able to attain profitability without additional funding, which may be unavailable . eJobResource, Inc. has limited capital resources. To date, eJobResource has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated sufficient cash from operations to be profitable or to maintain sufficient inventory. Unless eJobResource begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, eJobResource may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force eJobResource to cease operations if additional financing is not available. No known alternative resources of funds are available to eJobResource in the event it does not have adequate proceeds from this offering. However, eJobResource believes that the net proceeds of the Minimum Offering will be sufficient to satisfy the start-up and operating requirements for the next six months. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING You may not be able to sell your shares in eJobResource because there is no public market for eJobResource stock . There is no public market for eJobResource common stock. Shailesh Shah, an officer and director, currently holds 51% of the eJobResource issued and outstanding common stock. Therefore, the current and potential market for eJobResource common stock is limited. No market is available for investors in eJobResource common stock to sell their shares if the Company does not acquire listing status. eJobResource cannot guarantee that a meaningful trading market will develop. 8 If eJobResource stock ever becomes tradable, of which eJobResource cannot guarantee success, the trading price of eJobResource common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various events or factors, many of which are or will be beyond eJobResources control. In addition, the stock market may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which, without a direct relationship to the operating performance, may affect the market price of eJobResource stock. Investors may have difficulty liquidating their investment because eJobResources stock will be subject to Penny Stock Regulation . The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. The rules, in part, require broker/dealers to provide penny stock investors with increased risk disclosure documents and make a special written determination that a penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These heightened disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the number of broker/dealers willing to make a market in eJobResource shares, thereby reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market that may develop for eJobResource shares. Consequently, customers in eJobResource securities may find it difficult to sell their securities, if at all. Investors in this offering will bear a substantial risk of loss due to immediate and substantial dilution . The principal shareholder of eJobResource, Shailesh Shah, who also serves as its Director, President, and Treasurer, acquired 15,675,000 restricted shares of eJobResource common stock at a price per share of $0.0001 as a result of the merger. Upon the sale of the common stock offered hereby, the investors in this offering will experience an immediate and substantial dilution. Therefore, the investors in this offering will bear a substantial portion of the risk of loss. Additional sales of eJobResource common stock in the future could result in further dilution. Please refer to the section titled Dilution herein. All of eJobResources issued and outstanding common shares are restricted under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, as amended. When the restriction on these shares is lifted, and the shares are sold in the open market, the price of eJobResource common stock could be adversely affected . All of the presently outstanding shares of common stock, aggregating 30,700,000 shares of common stock, are restricted securities as defined under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration, if available. Rule 144, as amended, is an exemption that generally provides that a person who has satisfied a one year holding period for such restricted securities may sell, within any three month period (provided eJobResource is current in its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act), subject to certain manner of resale provisions, an amount of restricted securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of a companys outstanding common stock or the average weekly trading volume in such securities during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale. eJobResource currently has one shareholder who owns 15,675,000 restricted shares or 51% of the aggregate shares of outstanding common stock. When these shares become unrestricted and available for sale, the sale of these shares by the individual, whether pursuant to Rule 144 or otherwise, may have an immediate negative effect upon the price of eJobResource common stock in any market that might develop. eJobResource is selling the shares offered in this prospectus without an underwriter and may not be able to sell any of the shares offered herein . Shailesh Shah and Bhupendra M. Bhatt, eJobResources officers and directors, are offering the common shares on a best-efforts basis on eJobResources behalf. There is no broker-dealer retained as an underwriter and no broker-dealer is under any obligation to purchase any common shares. There are no firm commitments to purchase any of the shares in this offering. Consequently, there is no guarantee that eJobResource is capable of selling all, or any, of the common shares offered hereby. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. This prospectus contains forward-looking statements about eJobResource business, financial condition, and prospects that reflect eJobResource managements assumptions and beliefs based on information currently available. eJobResource can give no assurance that the expectations indicated by such forward-looking statements will be realized. If any of eJobResource assumptions should prove incorrect, or if any of the risks and uncertainties underlying such expectations should materialize, the actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. 9 The key factors that are not within eJobResources control and that may have a direct bearing on operating results include, but are not limited to, acceptance of the proposed advertising monitors that eJobResource expects to market, eJobResources ability to establish a customer base, managements ability to raise capital in the future, the retention of key employees and changes in the regulation of the industry in which eJobResource functions. There may be other risks and circumstances that management may be unable to predict to sustain operations. When used in this prospectus, words such as, believes, expects, intends, plans, anticipates, estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify and qualify forward-looking statements, although there may be certain forward-looking statements not accompanied by such expressions. USE OF PROCEEDS Without realizing the minimum offering proceeds, eJobResource will not be able to commence planned operations and implement its business plan. Please refer to the section, herein, titled Managements Discussion and Plan of Operation for further information. eJobResource intends to use the proceeds from this offering as follows: Minimum 100% of Maximum Application of Proceeds $ % of total $ % of total Total Offering Proceeds 100,000 100 500,000 100 Offering Expenses Legal & Professional Fees 12,000 12.00 12,000 2.10 Accounting Fees 30,000 30.00 30,000 6.00 Blue-sky fees 9,000 9.00 9,000 1.90 Total Offering Expenses 51,000 51.00 51,000 10.00 Net Proceeds from Offering 49,000 49.00 449,000 90.00 Use of Net Proceeds Accounting Fees 5,000 5.00 5,000 1.00 Equipment - Demonstration 4,000 4.00 24,000 5.00 Legal and Professional Fees 8,000 8.00 28,000 5.00 Office Equipment and Furniture 5,000 5.00 17,000 4.00 Office Supplies 3,000 3.00 3,500 0.70 Salaries 15,000 20.00 180,000 36.00 Sales and Marketing 7,000 7.00 159,500 32.00 Working Capital (1) 2,000 2.00 32,000 6.30 Total Use of Net Proceeds 49,000 100.00 449,000 100.00 Total Use of Proceeds 100,000 100 500,000 100 Notes: (1) The category of General Working Capital may include, but not be limited to, office rent, inventory procurement, printing costs, postage, telephone services, overnight delivery services and other general operating expenses. 10 DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The offering price of the common stock has been arbitrarily determined and bears no relationship to any objective criterion of value. The price does not bear any relationship to eJobResources assets, book value, historical earnings, or net worth. In determining the offering price, management considered such factors as the prospects, if any, for similar companies, anticipated results of operations, present financial resources and the likelihood of acceptance of this offering. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of our securities. DILUTION OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES Dilution represents the difference between the offering price of the shares of common stock and the net book value per share of common stock immediately after completion of the offering. Net Tangible Book Value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. In this offering, the level of dilution is increased as a result of the relatively low book value of eJobResources issued and outstanding stock. This is due in part because of the common stock issued to the eJobResource officers, directors, and employees totaling 30,700,000 shares at par value $0.0001 per share versus the current offering price of $0.20 per share. Please refer to the section titled Certain Transactions, herein, for more information. Assuming all 2,500,000 shares offered are sold, and in effect eJobResource receives the maximum estimated proceeds of this offering from shareholders, eJobResource net book value will be approximately $.01230 per share. Therefore, any investor will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $.18770 per share, while the eJobResource present stockholders will receive an increase of $.01528 per share in the net tangible book value of the shares that they hold. This will result in a 93.85% dilution for purchasers of stock in this offering. In the event that the minimum offering of 500,000 shares is achieved, eJobResource net book value will be approximately $.00027 per share. Therefore, any investor will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $.19973 per share while the eJobResource present stockholder will receive an increase of $.00325 per share in the net tangible book value of the shares he holds. This will result in a 99.87% dilution for purchasers of stock in this offering. The following table illustrates the dilution to the purchaser of the common stock in this offering. This table represents a comparison of the various prices paid by the individual who purchased shares in eJobResource previously: Minimum Maximum Offering Offering Book Value Per Share Before the Offering $ (0.00298 ) $ (0.00298) Book Value Per Share After the Offering $ .00027 $ .01230 Net Increase to Original Shareholders $ .00325 $ .01528 Decrease in Investment to New Shareholders $ .19973 $ .18770 Dilution to New Shareholders (%) 99.87% 93.85% SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS The 12 selling shareholders are offering 8,975,000 shares of common stock already issued.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS GENERAL INFORMATION eJobResources, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 27, 2004. Our key markets are in North America and India and eJobResource works by connecting employers with quality job seekers at all levels and by providing personalized career advice to consumers. For the employer, our goal is to provide the most effective solutions and easiest to use technology to simplify the hiring process and deliver access to our community of job seekers. For job seekers, our purpose is to improve their careers by providing work-related content, services and advice to enhance the consumer experience. Our services and solutions include searchable job postings, a resume database, and other career related content. Job seekers can search our job postings and post their resumes on our website. We continue to seek to be the premier integrated global human resource and job placement portal provider to businesses and consumers in North America and India. We also believe that demand for our services is significant and growing rapidly as businesses and consumers seek alternatives to the communications services currently offered in India. We intend to continue to focus on providing superior performance and high levels of customer service and technical support to increase our customer base and maximize customer satisfaction. Our long-term business strategy is designed to further our primary goal of capitalizing on the significant opportunity in the global online recruitment marketplace. We believe that concentrating our resources and energy on online recruitment, and specifically focusing on the eJobResource.com brand and businesses will best enable us to capitalize on the long-term opportunity and dynamic operating conditions within online recruitment. By streamlining our operating portfolio and increasing internal and external investments in online recruitment, we have simplified our strategy and operations. As a result, we believe that we have improved our ability to achieve higher long-term growth rates and the potential for greater profit margins. 15 We believe that the growth of the Internet and other network services in India has been inhibited by relatively high costs and poor user experiences caused by an inadequate telecommunications infrastructure and slow network connection speeds. We are committed to expanding and enhancing our website and to providing high quality technical support to attract users to our services. We believe that our services provide our customers with the ability to exchange information, communicate and transact business over the Internet with speed, efficiency, reliability and security superior to other online recruiting companies. INDUSTRY BACKGROUND Progressive Positioning in a High Growth Industry According to e-recruitment analysts interbiznet.com, there are currently 15 million annual job changes taking place in the U.S. workforce of 100,000,000 people - - resulting in an estimated $90 billion market of cost to hire expenses. To reduce this cost, Internet technologies will increasingly centralize and integrate the entire corporate recruiting process into an e-business supply chain. During the past year the e-recruiting industry has seen vast financial growth and maturation. Forrester Research estimates that the online recruiting market has grown to a $2.4 billion in 2006. This is just the beginning. According to iLogos Research, 79% of companies now recruit on their corporate Web sites - - up dramatically from only 29% in 2003. By 2010, iLogos predicts more than 90% of the Global 500 will recruit on their corporate Web sites. Corporate Web sites will become the primary interface of an Internet-based hiring management system - - integrating recruiting from all sources including job boards, print media, job fair and employee referral programs. State-of-the-art Web-based recruiting systems will bring increased efficiencies and productivity to the corporate recruiting process. Development of the Internet We believe that the large and increasing number of home and office computers linked to the Internet, advances in network design, increased availability of Internet-based software and applications, the emergence of useful content and electronic commerce technologies, and convenient, fast and inexpensive Internet access will continue to drive Internet growth and usage in the near future. Special Communications Needs of Businesses As the Internet becomes more developed and reliable, businesses are increasingly utilizing the Internet for functions critical to their core business strategies, such as sales and marketing, customer service and project coordination. The Internet presents a compelling profit opportunity for businesses by enabling them to reduce operating costs, access valuable information and reach new markets. To maintain a significant presence on the Internet, businesses typically purchase Internet access services and establish a website. Internet access provides a company with its basic gateway to the Internet, allowing it to transfer e-mail, access information and connect with employees, customers and suppliers. A website provides a company with a tangible identity and an interactive presence on the Internet. Many corporations are also converting their legacy information systems and databases to web-enabled systems. The Opportunity in India As with many developing nations, the telecommunications infrastructure in India has, until recently, been controlled by government telecom providers. The resulting service remains inferior to service in developed countries. At the same time, however, the Indian economy continues to modernize and expand, particularly in sectors such as software development that are dependent on a reliable communications network. The growth of these industries is leading to an increasing base of personal computers and wired homes and businesses in India with a resulting increased demand for Internet services. We believe these trends, which mirror trends in more mature economies, will continue to develop in India. We expect the growth in personal computers and Internet users to increase the demand for Internet content directed towards domestic Indian consumers as well as the amount of electronic commerce in India. 16 PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THEIR MARKETS We are a sales-driven company, and we are committed to developing and extending an array of sales forces and selling approaches in order to best match customer needs and preferences. In the Large Size Businesses area of our business we focus on larger businesses, with larger sums available to spend, and we strive to add new products and services that will allow us to penetrate clients' human resources budgets. In the Small to Medium-Sized Businesses area of our business, we emphasize customer acquisition and seek to increase our coverage of the available customer base over time. Our self-service eCommerce sales channel allows advertisers to post jobs with greater flexibility and control, while also enabling us to better and more efficiently serve smaller customers and individuals with less frequent recruitment needs. Internet Advertising & Fees Our Internet Advertising & Fees segment provides consumers with content, services and useful offerings that help them manage the development and direction of their current and future careers, while providing employers, educators and marketers with innovative and targeted media-driven solutions to impact these consumers at critical moments in their lives. Our network appeals to advertisers and other third parties as our site cost-effectively delivers certain discrete demographic groups in a relevant and engaging online environment. We believe that by strengthening our user engagement, driving additional traffic and increasing usage of our website, we can increase the appeal to our customers and reward them with a higher return on their marketing investment. Our site is constantly evolving to integrate new and innovative features, in order to provide the relevant content that connects with our users. The majority of our services are free to users and are currently offered in North America and India. Revenue for the Internet Advertising & Fees segment is derived primarily from three types of services: lead generation, display advertising and products sold to consumers for a fee. Lead generation is a highly scalable direct response business in which marketers pay for connections to consumers whose demographics and interests match the requirements of specific business offerings. Our large database of users and ongoing collection of numerous points of data allows us to provide our clients with targeted and valuable leads. Display advertising opportunities have been integrated to include North America and India based content, allowing marketers to deliver targeted online advertising messages via numerous sizes and formats of creative units. Users come to our website for information and advice on how to manage their careers, and this environment is typically seen by marketers as desirable for promotion. Premium content and service s comprise the final source of revenue for the Internet Advertising & Fees segment, as consumers pay for access to information and tools that provide greater support in the development of their educational and career opportunities. India Focused Content and Electronic Commerce We are focusing internet content and electronic commerce for our website with customized details for the Indian market. We view the Indian market as a series of specific market segments with unique cultural and topical interests, rather than an extension of a homogeneous, worldwide Internet market. We have assembled a team of India-based employees familiar with the local culture, language and business environments in our markets to develop Internet content and electronic commerce tailored for the Indian market. We regularly incorporate new and original third-party content suited to our local and regional audiences to enhance our customers online experience and to attract new users both within India and North America. As a result of our local market knowledge, we have been able to increase traffic flow to our website and to create brand awareness for eJobResource.com. Target Markets The online recruitment opportunity is global in nature and as Internet penetration and eCommerce adoption progress overseas, we see attractive new market opportunities for eJobPlacement.com. We intend to participate in the international opportunity by projecting elements of our product, operating plan and strategy into overseas markets, and we will continue to examine opportunities to bolster our international profile, whether by acquisition or internal investment. 17 India Target Market Our main focus internationally is India where online recruiting offers tremendous opportunity. It is believed that low cost of personal computers, a growing installed base for Internet use, and an increasingly competitive Internet Service Provider (ISP) market will help fuel online recruiting growth in Asia's second most populous nation. According to a McKinsey-Nasscom report by the year 2008, e-commerce transactions in India are expected to reach $100 billion. The Indian middle class of 288 million people is equal to the entire U.S. consumer base. This makes India a very attractive market. North America Target Market Recruitment advertising is predominantly a local business, and eJobPlacement.com seeks to establish brand recognition, seeker traffic and employer relationships on a local basis throughout our organization. In North America, we continue to pursue local leadership through targeted marketing efforts, localized websites and local sales efforts. Internationally, we tend to rely upon local management and customized market-specific sales and marketing strategies as well. During the past year the e-recruiting industry has seen vast financial growth and maturation. Forrester Research estimates that the online recruiting market has grown to a $2.4 billion in 2006. DISTRIBUTION METHODS Our goal is to become the leading global human resource and job placement portal to businesses and consumers in North America and India. Our principal business strategies to accomplish this objective are: Increase Market Penetration Increase penetration in our existing markets by expanding awareness of the eJobResource brand name to capitalize on our first mover advantage in India. We intend to capitalize on our first-to-market advantage in India to establish national brand name in advance of other private competitors. We believe that increased delivery of broadband services by the Government of India, availability of broadband content, reduced cost of personal computers and increased purchasing capacity of the middle class in India will drive this business forward in the future. New Technology Expand our services with new technologies to enable our customers to use the Internet more effectively. We continually seek to expand the breadth of our service offerings with new technologies. Value Added Services Provide more value added services by leveraging on the rapid growth of wireless Internet and mobile services in India and strengthen our Internet site with more content tailored to Indian interests worldwide. Our website eJobResource.com will ultimately function as an initial gateway to the Internet; the users starting point for web browsing and other Internet services. Our website will be media rich, user friendly and interactive offering hyperlinks to a wide variety of websites and services, including our own websites. Our website will cater to a variety of Indian interests within and outside of India. To achieve our goal of developing the premier Internet website focused on the Indian market, we intend to continue to expand and improve the quality of the website and develop additional content oriented towards topical and cultural interests of Indians worldwide. Strategic Alliances Form strategic alliances with several online and offline media partners to deliver content to our users. As the availability of Internet access expands in India, we believe that increasing numbers of Internet users will be attracted to our high quality website and online content designed specifically for the Indian consumer. We will seek to attract advertisers, electronic commerce merchants and third-party content providers trying to reach our users in order to generate additional revenue. We intend to initiate a number of strategic relationships with key vendors of Internet-related hardware, software and services. These relationships will result in two significant benefits. First, they provide us with the ability to offer valuable services to our customers in India. In addition, these relationships help us market our services by providing us with access to our partners customer bases. 18 Strategic Investments Pursue selective strategic investments, alliances and acquisitions to expand our customer base, increase utilization of our network and add new technologies to our service mix. We believe that our growth can be supplemented by selective acquisitions of complementary businesses. We may seek to expand our market presence in our corporate network business through the acquisition of web hosting, data center, web implementation and/or systems integration companies serving India, the United States or other markets. We will also consider acquisitions of Internet service providers that have a significant or growing customer base in our current or targeted markets. STATUS OF ANY PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED NEW PRODUCTS We have not publicly announced any new products. COMPETITION The markets for our services and products are highly competitive and are characterized by pressure to win new customers, expand the market for our services and to incorporate new capabilities and technologies. We face competition from a number of sources. These sources include other employment-related websites, traditional media companies (primarily newspaper publishers), Internet portals, search engines and social networking websites. Many traditional media companies and newspaper publishers offer new media capabilities such as online recruitment websites. The barriers to entry into Internet businesses like ours are relatively low such that new competitors continuously arise. For example, over the past several years many niche career websites have been launched targeted at specific industry verticals. Many of our competitors or potential competitors have long operating histories, and some have greater financial, management, technological, deve lopment, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, our ability to maintain our existing clients and generate new clients depends to a significant degree on the quality of our services, pricing and reputation among our clients and potential clients. eJobResource has many potential competitors in the HR and recruitment e-commerce portal business with respect to direct sales of PCs, computer parts, and other Information Technology products. We consider the competition is competent, experienced, and they have greater financial and technical, and marketing resources than we do at the present. Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development, sales, and marketing of their products and services than are available to us. SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS Our goal is to become the leading global human resource and job placement portal to businesses and consumers in North America and India.

DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS We feel that, because of the potential wide base of customers for our services, we will not rely on one or a few major customers. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS We do not have, nor do we intend to apply for in the near future, any patents or trademarks. We will assess the need for any patents or trademarks on a continuing basis. NEED FOR ANY GOVERNMENT APPROVAL OR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS We do not require any government approval for our services. GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION We will be subject to federal laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations including securities laws. We will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES Other than time spent researching our proposed business we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date.

We consider our current corporate office space arrangement adequate and will reassess our needs based upon the future growth of the company. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not involved in any pending legal proceeding nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS No public market currently exists for shares of our common stock. Following completion of this offering, we intend to apply to have our common stock listed for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. PENNY STOCK RULES The Securities and Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). A purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock. The shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need to comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document, which: - Contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stock in both Public offerings and secondary trading; - Contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended; - Contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask price for the penny stock and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; - Contains a toll-free number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; 21 - Defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and - Contains such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format) as the Securities and Exchange Commission shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, to the customer: - The bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; - The compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; - The number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and - Monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgement of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities. REGULATION M Our officer and director, who will offer and sell the Shares, is aware that he is required to comply with the provisions of Regulation M promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. With certain exceptions, Regulation M precludes the officers and directors, sales agents, any broker-dealer or other person who participate in the distribution of shares in this offering from bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any security which is the subject of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete. REPORTS We are subject to certain reporting requirements and will furnish annual financial reports to our stockholders, certified by our independent accountants, and will furnish un-audited quarterly financial reports in our quarterly reports filed electronically with the SEC. All reports and information filed by us can be found at the SEC website, www.sec.gov . STOCK TRANSFER AGENT Our stock transfer agent is Holladay Stock Transfer, 2939 N 67th Pl, Scottsdale, Arizona 85251, Telephone number (480) 481-3940. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our fiscal year end is December 31. We intend to provide financial statements audited by an Independent Registered Accounting Firm to our shareholders in our annual reports. The audited financial statements for the period from the date of incorporation, January 24, 2007, to December 31, 2007 and the reviewed financials for the 3 months ended March 31, 2008 immediately follow. 22 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a negative current ratio and Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $91,523 for the period from January 01, 2007 to December 31, 2007. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the period from the date of incorporation through December 31, 2007. For detailed financial information, see the financial statements included in this prospectus. Balance Sheet Data : 12/31/2007 Cash $ 88 Total assets $ 12,088 Total liabilities $ 103,612 Shareholders equity $ (91,523) Other than the shares being registered by this prospectus, no other source of capital has been identified or sought. PLAN OF OPERATION GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a negative current ratio and Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $91,523 for the period from January 01, 2007 to December 31, 2007. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its new business opportunities. Management has implemented a new business model, taking the Company in the direction of IT placement and more consulting. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a public offering of its common stock. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The statements were prepared following generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America consistently applied. B. BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. 23 C. CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. D. USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. E. INCOME TAXES Prior to year ending December 31, 2007 the company was organized as an LLC and elected to be taxed as a partnership. Therefore, no provision for income taxes needed to be made for the years ending December 31, 2006 and 2005. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the net deferred taxes, as of December 31, 2007 are as follows: Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carry forward $95,413 Less valuation allowance (95,413) Total net deferred tax assets - The federal statutory tax rate reconciled to the effective tax rate during fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, is as follows: 2007 2006 Tax at U.S. Statutory Rate 35.0% 35.0% Change in valuation allowance (35.0) (35.0) 0.0% 0.0% Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Management believes that the following new pronouncements will have no significant impact on the financial statements. 24 In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS 157 'Fair Value Measurements'. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of this Statement will change current practice. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on financial statements. In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS 158 "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This Statement improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not-for-profit organization. This Statement also improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded stat us of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. An employer without publicly traded equity securities is required to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after June 15, 2007. However, an employer without publicly traded equity securities is required to disclose the following information in the notes to financial statements for a fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006, but before June 16, 2007, unless it has applied the recognition provisions of this Statement in preparing those financial statements. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The management is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on financial statements . In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. It requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration, pre-acquisition contingencies, transaction costs, in-process research and development, and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141R, changes in an acquired entity's deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact income tax expense. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensuses on EITF Issue No. 06-04, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF 06-04) and EITF Issue No. 06-10, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit A spects of Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF 06-10), which require that a company recognize a liability for the postretirement benefits associated with endorsement and collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangements. Cactus is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the provisions of EITF 06-04 and EITF 06-10 will have on its consolidated financial statements. The adoption of these new Statements is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys current financial position, results or operations, or cash flows.

INDEMNIFICATION Pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a law suit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. In certain cases, we may advance expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in any such proceeding as to which such person is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorneys fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. 28 In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. AVAILABLE INFORMATION We have filed a registration statement on Form S-1, of which this prospectus is a part, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides reasonable basis for my opinion. In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of eJobResource, Inc as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the results of operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred negative cash flows and has accumulated shareholders equity, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /S/ Hawkins Accounting May 16, 2008 Los Angeles, CA 30 eJobResource, Inc.

(A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 Note 1 - Organization and Principal Activities Organization eJobResource, Inc (the Company) is a Nevada corporation, incorporated on January 27, 2004. The Companys original name at inception was Nevada Support, Inc. On October, 10 th 2007, the Company entered into a stock swap with eJobResource.com, LLC (a California LLC). The Company on November 20th, 2007, changed its name to eJobResource, Inc. which better reflected its principal business strategies. For accounting purposes, the acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization of eJobResource.com LLC, with eJobResource.com LLC being the accounting acquirer. The historical financial statements are those of eJobResource.com, LLC. Loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2007 and all share-related data have been presented giving effect to the recapitalization resulting from the reverse merger. The Company is engaged in the business of personnel recruiting and contract placement recruitment of personnel business during the period ending December 31, 2007. Prior to December 31, 2007, eJobResource.com, LLC. was in the technology sector, in both hardware and software. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, management expectations for future performance, and other assumptions as appropriate. Key areas affected by estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation provisions, income taxes and contingencies. Actual results may vary from those estimates. 35 Revenue recognition The Company currently recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements'. The Company recognizes revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, including factors such as when there has been evidence of a sales arrangement, delivery has occurred, or service have been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The company is responsible for fulfillment including acceptability of the service ordered by customer, therefore company records revenue on Gross basis during the year ending December 31, 2006 and 2005. The Company has since discontinued these types of arrangements to implement its new business plan of on-line job boards for the IT industry. Comprehensive Income (loss) The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", which requires the disclosure of comprehensive income, which includes net income (loss), unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale, and foreign currency translation adjustments. Stock - Based Compensation The Company may periodically issue shares of common stock for services rendered or for other costs and expenses. Such shares will be valued based on the market price of the shares on the transaction date. The Company may periodically issue stock options to employees and stock options or warrants to non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. In March 2004, the FASB issued a proposed statement, Share-Based Payment, which addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the grant-date fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payme nts to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their grant-date fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. 36 As permitted by SFAS No. 123, for the year 2007, the Company has not accounted for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25's intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", requires presentation of basic earnings per share ("Basic EPS) and diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS). Basic earnings (loss) per share has not been since the Company has a loss for the year 2007. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, requires presentation of basic earnings per share (Basic EPS) and diluted earnings per share (Diluted EPS). Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (including shares reserved for issuance) during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Cash and Cash Equivalents All cash and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash and cash equivalents, since they are readily convertible to cash. These short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition, generally without collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer's financial condition. The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses, as required. Accounts are "written-off" when deemed uncollectible. Management has determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts was not deemed necessary at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Costs of replacements and major improvements are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation expense is provided primarily by methods approximating the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, taking into consideration any residual value. The estimated lives of the assets range from three to five years. 37 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition, generally without collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customers financial condition. The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses, as required. Accounts are written-off when deemed uncollectible. Management has determined based on the fact that the receivable for the period ending December 31, 20076 is from a related party, no provision for doubtful accounts is deemed necessary for the years ending December 31, 2007. Long Lived Assets The Company accounts for our long-lived, tangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. As a result, the Company assesses long-lived assets classified as held and used, including the equipment and furniture, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. These events would include significant current period operating cash flow losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset group of assets combined with a history of such losses, significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative history or economic trends. Management evaluated the long-lived assets for impairment during 2007 and did not note any triggering event that the carrying values of material long lived assets are not recoverable. Fair Value Estimates The fair value of an asset or liability is the amount at which it could be exchanged or settled in a current transaction between willing parties. The carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent marketable securities, restricted investments, accounts receivable and accrued liabilities and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. Note 3 - Recently issued accounting pronouncements Management believes that the following new pronouncements will have no significant impact on the financial statements. In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS 157 'Fair Value Measurements'. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of this Statement will change current practice. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on financial statements. 38 In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS 158 "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This Statement improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not-for-profit organization. This Statement also improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretireme nt plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. An employer without publicly traded equity securities is required to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after June 15, 2007. However, an employer without publicly traded equity securities is required to disclose the following information in the notes to financial statements for a fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006, but before June 16, 2007, unless it has applied the recognition provisions of this Statement in preparing those financial statements. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The management is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued Sta tement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. It requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration, pre-acquisition contingencies, transaction costs, in-process research and development, and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141R, changes in an acquired entity's deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact income tax expense. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensuses on EITF Issue No. 06-04, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF 06-04) and EITF Issue No. 06-10, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Collateral Assignment Spli t-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF 06-10), which require that a company recognize a liability for the postretirement benefits associated with endorsement and collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangements. Cactus is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the provisions of EITF 06-04 and EITF 06-10 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 39 Note 4 - Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following at December 31, 2007 and 2006: December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Property and equipment $ 15,000 $ 0 Accumulated depreciation (3,000) 0 $ 12,000 0 Depreciation expense was $ 3000, $0 and $0 for years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. Note 5 - Income taxes Prior to year ending December 31, 2007 the company was organized as an LLC and elected to be taxed as a partnership. Therefore, no provision for income taxes needed to be made for the years ending December 31, 2006 and 2005. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the net deferred taxes, as of December 31, 2007 are as follows: Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carry forward $ 95,413 Less valuation allowance (95,413) Total net deferred tax assets - The federal statutory tax rate reconciled to the effective tax rate during fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, is as follows: 2007 2006 Tax at U.S. Statutory Rate 35.0% 35.0% Change in valuation allowance (35.0) (35.0) 0.0% 0.0% 40 Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Note 6 - Going concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a negative current ratio and Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $91,523 for the period from January 01, 2007 to December 31, 2007. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its new business opportunities. Management has implemented a new business model, taking the Company in the direction of IT placement and more consulting. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a public offering of its common stock. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. Note 7 - Concentrations Over 50% of the Company's revenues were generated from one customer during the year ended December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, accounts receivable from this one customer represented 100% of the Company's total accounts receivable. Note 8 Related Party Transactions The Company has paid a vendor controlled by a major shareholder of the company fees for consulting and business support services, including purchase of fixed assets. Payments totaled $37,493 and $2,041 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 respectively. Payables to this vendor in the amount of $74,512 are also carried as a current liability as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2006, the Company carried a receivable of $3,447 from the same vendor. The Company has been engaged by a vendor controlled by the same major shareholder referred to above to provide placement services and consulting services. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized revenues of $63,355. 41 eJobResource, Inc.

Footnote to Financial Statements For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Note 1 - Organization and Principal Activities Organization eJobResource, Inc (the Company) is a Nevada corporation, incorporated on January 27, 2004. The Companys original name at inception was Nevada Support, Inc. In October 2007, the Company entered into a stock swap with eJobResource.com, LLC (a California LLC). The Company on December 10, 2007 changed its name to eJobResource, Inc. and adopted its subsidiary, eJobResource.com, LLCs business plan. The Company is engaged in the business of personnel recruiting and contract placement during the period ending March 31, 2008. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, management expectations for future performance, and other assumptions as appropriate. Key areas affected by estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation provisions, income taxes and contingencies. Actual results may vary from those estimates. Revenue recognition The Company currently recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements'. The Company recognizes revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, including factors such as when there has been evidence of a sales arrangement, delivery has occurred, or service have been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Comprehensive Income (loss) The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", which requires the disclosure of comprehensive income, which includes net income (loss), unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale, and foreign currency translation adjustments. 46 Stock - Based Compensation The Company may periodically issue shares of common stock for services rendered or for other costs and expenses. Such shares will be valued based on the market price of the shares on the transaction date. The Company may periodically issue stock options to employees and stock options or warrants to non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. In March 2004, the FASB issued a proposed statement, Share-Based Payment, which addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the grant-date fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payme nts to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their grant-date fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, for the year 2007, the Company has not accounted for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25's intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, requires presentation of basic earnings per share (Basic EPS) and diluted earnings per share (Diluted EPS). Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (including shares reserved for issuance) during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Cash and Cash Equivalents All cash and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash and cash equivalents, since they are readily convertible to cash. These short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 47 Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition, generally without collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer's financial condition. The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses, as required. Accounts are "written-off" when deemed uncollectible. Management has determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts was not deemed necessary at March 31, 2008 and 2007. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Costs of replacements and major improvements are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation expense is provided primarily by methods approximating the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, taking into consideration any residual value. The estimated lives of the assets range from three to five years. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition, generally without collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customers financial condition. The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses, as required. Accounts are written-off when deemed uncollectible. Because receivables have been from a related party, no provision for doubtful accounts is deemed necessary. There are no receivables as of March 31, 2008. Long Lived Assets The Company accounts for our long-lived, tangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. As a result, the Company assesses long-lived assets classified as held and used, including the equipment and furniture, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. These events would include significant current period operating cash flow losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset group of assets combined with a history of such losses, significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative history or economic trends. Management evaluated the long-lived assets for impairment during 2007 and did not note any triggering event that the carrying values of material long lived assets are not recoverable. 48 Fair Value Estimates The fair value of an asset or liability is the amount at which it could be exchanged or settled in a current transaction between willing parties. The carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current marketable securities, restricted investments, accounts receivable and accrued liabilities and other current assets and liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. Note 3 - Recently issued accounting pronouncements Management believes that the following new pronouncements will have no significant impact on the financial statements. In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS 157 'Fair Value Measurements'. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of this Statement will change current practice. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on financial statements. In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS 158 "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This Statement improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not-for-profit organization. This Statement also improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretireme nt plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. An employer without publicly traded equity securities is required to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after June 15, 2007. However, an employer without publicly traded equity securities is required to disclose the following information in the notes to financial statements for a fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006, but before June 16, 2007, unless it has applied the recognition provisions of this Statement in preparing those financial statements. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The management is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on financial statements. 49 In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . It requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration, preacquisition contingencies, transaction costs, in-process research and development, and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141R, changes in an acquired entity's deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact income tax expense. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensuses on EITF Issue No. 06-04, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF 06-04) and EITF Issue No. 06-10, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF 06-10), which require that a company recognize a liability for the postretirement benefits associated with endorsement and collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangements. Cactus is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the provisions of EITF 06-04 and EITF 06-10 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Note 4 - Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following at March 31, 2008 and 2007: March 31, March 31, 2008 2007 Property and equipment $ 15,000 $ 15,000 Accumulated depreciation $ (3,750) $ 0 $ 11,250 $ 15,000 Depreciation expense included in other expenses was $ 750 for the period ending March 31, 2008 and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2007. 50 Note 5 - Income taxes Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Note 6 - Going concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $54,912 for the three months ended March 31, 2008. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its new business opportunities. Management has implemented a new business model, taking the Company in the direction of IT placement and more consulting. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a public offering of its common stock. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. Note 7: Related Party Transactions The Company has paid a vendor controlled by a major shareholder of the company fees for consulting and business support services, including purchase of fixed assets. Payments to this vendor totaled $11,107 and $2,041 for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 respectively. Payables to this vendor in the amount of $88,074 are also carried as a current liability as of March 31, 2008. In addition, the Company received $20,000 in additional loans from the major shareholder above. 51 DEALER PROSPECTUS DELIVERY OBLIGATION UNTIL___________________________, ALL DEALERS THAT EFFECT TRANSACTIONS IN THESE SECURITIES, WHETHER OR NOT PARTICIPATING IN THIS OFFERING, MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER A PROSPECTUS.

OTHER EXPENSES OF ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION The following table sets forth the costs and expenses payable by eJobResource in connection with registering the sale of the common stock. eJobResource has agreed to pay all costs and expenses in connection with this offering of common stock. Set for the below is the estimated expenses of issuance and distribution, assuming the maximum proceeds are raised. Legal and Professional Fees $12,000.00 Accounting Fees $30,000.00 Blue Sky Qualification Fees $ 9,000.00 Total $51,000.00 ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS eJobResource, Inc.s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide for the indemnification of a present or former director or officer. eJobResource indemnifies any director, officer, employee or agent who is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense on any action or suit. Such indemnification shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, expenses, including attorneys fees actually or reasonably incurred by him. Nevada law also provides for discretionary indemnification for each person who serves as or at eJobResource request as an officer or director. eJobResource may indemnify such individual against all costs, expenses, and liabilities incurred in a threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding brought because such individual is a director or officer. Such individual must have conducted himself in good faith and reasonably believed that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, eJobResources best interes ts. In a criminal action, he must not have had a reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. NEVADA LAW Pursuant to the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes 78.751,eEJobResource shall indemnify any director, officer and employee as follows: Every director, officer, or employee of eJobResource shall be indemnified by us against all expenses and liabilities, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred by or imposed upon him/her in connection with any proceeding to which he/she may be made a party, or in which he/she may become involved, by reason of being or having been a director, officer, employee or agent of eJobResource or is or was serving at the request of eJobResource as a director, officer, employee or agent of eJobResource, partnership, joint venture, trust or enterprise, or any settlement thereof, whether or not he/she is a director, officer, employee or agent at the time such expenses are incurred, except in such cases wherein the director, officer, employee or agent is adjudged guilty of willful misfeasance or malfeasance in the perfor mance of his/her duties; provided that in the event of a settlement the indemnification herein shall apply only when the Board of Directors approves such settlement and reimbursement as being for the best interests of eJobResource. eJobResource shall provide to any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of eJobResource, Inc. as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or enterprise, the indemnity against expenses of a suit, litigation or other proceedings which is specifically permissible under applicable law. As to indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for directors, officers or controlling persons, we have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable. ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES. Set forth below is information regarding the issuance and sales of securities without registration since inception. No such sales involved the use of an underwriter; no advertising or public solicitation was involved; the securities bear a restrictive legend; and no commissions were paid in connection with the sale of any securities. 53 As of December 31, 2004 there were 25,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.0001authorized by the Company. In 2004 the Company issued a total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock to advisory and company founders for services rendered. In 2006 the Company amended its articles of incorporation to provide for an increase in authorized capitalization from 25,000,000 common shares to 100,000,000 common shares. On October 10, 2007 the Company issued 20,700,000 restricted common shares as a result of the merger between Nevada Support, Inc. and eJobResource.com, LLC, wherein Nevada Support, Inc. became the surviving entity and changed its name to eJobResource, Inc.

Under Rule 415 of the Securities Act, we are registering securities for an offering to be made on a continuous or delayed basis in the future. The registration statement pertains only to securities (a) the offering of which will be commenced promptly, will be made on a continuous basis and may continue for a period in excess of 30 days from the date of initial effectiveness and (b) are registered in an amount which, at the time the registration statement becomes effective, is reasonably expected to be offered and sold within two years from the initial effective date of the registration. Based on the above-referenced facts and in compliance with the above-referenced rules, eJobResource includes the following undertakings in this Registration Statement: A. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period, in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in the volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of the Registration Fee table in the effective Registration Statement; and (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the Registration Statement or any material change to such information in the Registration Statement. (1) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new Registration Statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 55 (2) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. B. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnif ication by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 56 SIGNATURES In accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements of filing on Form S-1 and authorized this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, in the City of Buena Park, State of California on June 16, 2008. eJobResource, Inc.
