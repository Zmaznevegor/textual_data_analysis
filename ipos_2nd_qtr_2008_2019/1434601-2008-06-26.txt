COMMON STOCK The selling shareholders named in this prospectus are offering all of the shares of common stock offered through this prospectus. Our common stock is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange and have no voting rights. The 1,700,000 shares of our common stock can be sold by selling security holders at a fixed price of $0.01 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the shares for the selling security holders. The selling stockholders, and any participating broker-dealers may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, and any commissions or discounts given to any such broker-dealer may be regarded as underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The selling stockholders have informed us that they do not have any agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute their common stock. Brokers or dealers effecting transaction in the shares should confirm the registration of these securities under the securities laws of the states in which transactions occur or the existence of our exemption from registration. THE COMPANY IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN UNSOUND FINANCIAL CONDITION. PERSONS SHOULD NOT INVEST UNLESS THEY CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENTS. THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FACTORS DESCRIBED UNDER THE HEADING “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING ON PAGE 7. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Date of This Prospectus Is: June __, 2008 2 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Please note that throughout this prospectus, the words “we”, “our” or “us” refer to the Company and not to the selling stockholders. WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY THAT YOU CAN USE TO EVALUATE US, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR SUCCESS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE PROBLEMS, EXPENSES, DIFFICULTIES, COMPLICATIONS AND DELAYS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED BY A SMALL DEVELOPING COMPANY. We were incorporated in Florida in January 2008. We have no significant financial resources and no revenues to date. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate. Since we have a limited operating history, we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to meet our expenses and support our anticipated activities. WE WILL REQUIRE FINANCING TO ACHIEVE OUR CURRENT BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INABILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING COULD PROHIBIT US FROM EXECUTING OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND CAUSE US TO SLOW DOWN OUR EXPANSION OF OPERATIONS. We will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or sale of equity to achieve our current business strategy. Such financing may not be available when needed. Even if such financing is available, it may be on terms that are materially adverse to your interests with respect to dilution of book value, dividend preferences, liquidation preferences, or other terms. Our capital requirements to implement our business strategy will be significant. Moreover, in addition to monies needed to continue operations over the next twelve months, we anticipate requiring additional funds in order to significantly expand our operations and acquire the operating entities as set forth in our plan of operations. No assurance can be given that such funds will be available or, if available, will be on commercially reasonable terms satisfactory to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing if and when it is needed on terms we deem acceptable. If we are unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms, we could be forced to delay or scale back our plans for expansion. In addition, such inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. OUR AUDITOR HAS EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. Based on our financial history since inception, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We are a development stage company that has never generated any revenue. From inception to May 31, 2008, we have incurred a net loss of $8,570. If we cannot obtain sufficient funding, we may have to delay the implementation of our business strategy. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON THE PERFORMANCE AND CONTINUED SERVICE OF BRUCE TRULIO. WITHOUT HIS CONTINUED SERVICE, WE MAY BE FORCED TO INTERRUPT OR EVENTUALLY CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. We are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of Bruce S. Trulio, our only officer. We currently do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Trulio. The loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. 3 Table of Contents THE OFFERING PRICE OF THE SHARES WAS ARBITRARILY DETERMINED, AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN INDICATOR OF THE FUTURE MARKET PRICE OF THE SECURITIES. THEREFORE, THE OFFERING PRICE BEARS NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE COMPANY, AND MAY MAKE OUR SHARES DIFFICULT TO SELL. Since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of $0.01 per share for the shares of common stock was arbitrarily determined. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. The offering price bears no relationship to the book value, assets or earnings of our company or any other recognized criteria of value. The offering price should not be regarded as an indicator of the future market price of the securities. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF A PUBLIC MARKET OR THAT THE COMMON STOCK WILL EVER TRADE ON A RECOGNIZED EXCHANGE. THEREFORE, YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK. There is no established public trading market for our common stock. Our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved or that a regular trading market will develop or that if developed, will be sustained. In the absence of a trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment. OUR COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED A PENNY STOCK, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY, SO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES. If our common stock becomes tradable in the secondary market, we will be subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, which in all likelihood would make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their securities. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock. USE OF PROCEEDS The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the shares for the selling security holders. 4 Table of Contents DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE Since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of the shares of common stock was arbitrarily determined. The offering price was determined by the price shares were sold to our shareholders in our private placement which was completed in April 2008 pursuant to an exemption under Rule 506 of Regulation D. The offering price of the shares of our common stock has been determined arbitrarily by us and does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. The facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) concurrently with the filing of this prospectus. In order to be quoted on the Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. In addition, there is no assurance that our common stock will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the common stock in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity. DILUTION The common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued. Accordingly, there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders. SELLING SHAREHOLDERS The shares to be offered by the selling stockholders were issued in private placement transactions by us, each of which was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The shares offered hereby are “restricted” securities under applicable federal and state securities laws and are being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to give the selling stockholders the opportunity to publicly sell these shares. This prospectus is part of a registration statement on Form S-1 filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act covering the resale of such shares of our common stock from time to time by the selling stockholders. No estimate can be given as to the amount or percentage of our common stock that will be held by the selling stockholders after any sales made pursuant to this prospectus because the selling stockholders are not required to sell any of the shares being registered under this prospectus. The following table assumes that the selling stockholders will sell all of the shares listed in this prospectus. The following table sets forth the name of the selling stockholders, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each of the selling stockholders as of June 23, 2008 and the number of shares of common stock being offered by the selling stockholders. The shares being offered hereby are being registered to permit public secondary trading, and the selling stockholders may offer all or part of the shares for resale from time to time. However, the selling stockholders are under no obligation to sell all or any portion of such shares nor are the selling stockholders obligated to sell any shares immediately upon effectiveness of this prospectus. All information with respect to share ownership has been furnished by the selling stockholders. 5 Table of Contents Name of Selling Stockholder Shares of Common Stock Owned Prior to Offering Shares of Common Stock to be Sold Shares of Common Stock Owned After Offering Percent of Common Stock Owned After Offering Maximum Associates, Inc.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION The selling security holders may sell some or all of their shares at a fixed price of $0.01 per share until our shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices. Prior to being quoted on the OTCBB, shareholders may sell their shares in private transactions to other individuals. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) concurrently with the filing of this prospectus. In order to be quoted on the Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. However, sales by selling security holder must be made at the fixed price of $0.01 until a market develops for the stock. Once a market has been developed for our common stock, the shares may be sold or distributed from time to time by the selling stockholders directly to one or more purchasers or through brokers or dealers who act solely as agents, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices, at negotiated prices or at fixed prices, which may be changed. The distribution of the shares may be effected in one or more of the following methods: o ordinary brokers transactions, which may include long or short sales, o transactions involving cross or block trades on any securities or market where our common stock is trading, market where our common stock is trading, o through direct sales to purchasers or sales effected through agents, o through transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether exchange listed of otherwise), or exchange listed or otherwise), or o any combination of the foregoing. In addition, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers who may engage in short sales, if short sales were permitted, of shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers that require the delivery by such broker-dealers of the shares, which shares may be resold thereafter pursuant to this prospectus. Brokers, dealers, or agents participating in the distribution of the shares may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal, or both (which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer may be in excess of customary commissions). Neither the selling stockholders nor we can presently estimate the amount of such compensation. We know of no existing arrangements between the selling stockholders and any other stockholder, broker, dealer or agent relating to the sale or distribution of the shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of the selling security holders pursuant to this prospectus. We have agreed to bear the expenses of the registration of the shares, including legal and accounting fees, and such expenses are estimated to be approximately $25,000. 7 Table of Contents Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, no FINRA member will charge commissions that exceed 8% of the total proceeds of the offering.

The Company has the principal business objective of providing sales and marketing services to small to medium sized Chinese tea producing companies who wish to export and distribute high quality Chinese tea products worldwide. We intend to commence business activity in the state of Florida with the hope of extending our business throughout the United States. The quality and effectiveness of sales and marketing services provided to small to medium sized exporters varies greatly, but two aspects remain constant; the cost of these services is high and companies have few choices of service providers that are effective and affordable, and that cater directly to the small and medium sized Chinese tea exporter. As yet, there is no company in Florida providing sales and marketing services for the small and mid-sized Chinese tea importers; therefore, there is a market gap to be exploited. We will use personal direct contact by reference, internet, cable and print advertising to provide these sales and marketing services. The sales and marketing process is a “hands on” process that requires the dedication and physical presence of the principals to solicit develop and close transactions. It is the intention that the principals will be the core of our sales staff. The use of the principals adds credibility and prestige to the client; both of which are critically important to the Chinese tea importers. The business model is based on a process where the principals directly contact small to medium sized Chinese tea exporters and solicit the sales and marketing for their products. The model designed requires the execution of a sales and marketing Agreement between the Chinese tea importer and our company. For the performance of these services, our company will receive a percentage of the Chinese tea exporters’ sales. This establishes a directly proportional relationship of the effectiveness of the sales and marketing effort to the remuneration received. We offer our relationships to advertising mediums, PR firms, outside sales staff and telemarketing houses as the professional base for its offering of services. This industry of sales and marketing services is replete with competition at all levels of expertise and professional variances. The market has not been explored for a company focused solely on the needs of small to medium size Chinese tea exporter. By maintaining a strong commitment to the highest level of courtesy, personal service and ethical standards, we can gain and maintain a reputation for integrity and customer loyalty, thereby insuring repeat business. Additionally, we will spend considerable efforts to develop customer relationships that insure repeat business and customer referral for the sales and marketing services offered by us. Marketing We will maintain a website detailing the services we offer with examples of our work, and establish an office to respond to questions, mail out informational brochures and schedule appointments. The web site will also serve as a platform to introduce the marketing effort of the exporters’ tea product. We will establish a brand identity for the imported tea product. The product will be positioned as a high-end luxury product. The 3,000 year history of this limited production, highly prized product will be essential in positioning the product and in differentiating this product from the current American and European viewpoint of commercially produced tea. The history, culture and ritual surrounding the production of the tea leaf and the ritual of the service and presentation of this luxury item will be exploited and are critical to the positioning of the product. The company will initially focus only on the United States market. Expansion outside this market is not contemplated in the near future due to the high risk factors associated with leaving a familiar market. There is a tremendous density of small to mid-sized international tea importers which creates a considerable market opportunity. We will, by maintaining a strong commitment to the highest level of courtesy, personal service and ethical standards, gain and maintains a reputation for integrity and customer loyalty, thereby insuring repeat business. Success in the positioning as a result of the marketing effort will generate new business and facilitate growth. 10 Table of Contents DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY Our business office is located at 2416 Lincoln Street, Hollywood, FL 33020 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There are no legal proceedings pending or threatened against us.

Certified Public Accountants REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors of: Zhong Sen International Tea Co.

(A Development Stage Company) as of May 31, 2008, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholder's equity and cash flows for the period from January 30, 2008 (inception) to May 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the financial position of Zhong Sen International Tea Co. (A Development Stage Company) as of May 31, 2008 and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the for the period from January 30, 2008 (inception) to May 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, the Company is in the development stage with no operations, has a net loss since inception of $8,570 and used cash in operations of $21,070. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning this matter are also described in Note 5. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Webb & Company, P.A. W EBB & COMPANY, P.A.

F-5 Table of Contents ZHONG SEN INTERNATIONAL TEA COMPANY (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of May 31, 2008 NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION Organization Zhong Sen International Tea Company (“The Company”) was incorporated on January 30, 2008, in the state of Florida. The Company has the principal business objective of providing sales and marketing services to small to medium sized Chinese tea producing companies who wish to export and distribute high quality Chinese tea products worldwide. The company intends to commence business activity in the state of Florida with the hope of extending its business throughout the United States. The Company has not had any significant operations or activities from inception; accordingly, the Company is deemed to be in the development stage. Use of Estimates: The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those results. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements’ and No. 104, “Revenue Recognition”. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Credit Risk: For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all cash accounts with maturities of 90 days or less and which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, as cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheet. The Company maintains a portion of its deposits in a financial institution that insures its deposits with the FDIC insurance up to $100,000 per depositor and deposits in excess of such insured amounts represent a credit risk to the Company. At May 31, 2008 the Company had $0 in cash that was uninsured. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“Statement 109”). Under Statement 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates (37.63%) expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. As of May 31, 2008 the Company has a net operating loss carry forward of $8,570 available to offset future taxable income through 2028. The valuation allowance at May 31, 2008 was $3,225. The net change in the valuation allowance for period January 30, 2008 (inception) to May 31, 2008 was an increase of $3,225. Stock Compensation The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”), which requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements with nonemployees in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force Abstract No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services. The Company records the expense of such services to employees and non employees based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument using the Black-Scholes pricing model. F-6 Table of Contents ZHONG SEN INTERNATIONAL TEA COMPANY (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of May 31, 2008 Segments The Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments including accounts payable and loans and notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for this instrument. Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings per Shares". Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings. As of May 31, 2008 there were no common share equivalents outstanding. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 160, “ Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51 ”. This statement improves the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards that require; the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value, entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 affects those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS 161). This statement is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133) as well as related hedged items, bifurcated derivatives, and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments. Entities with instruments subject to SFAS 161 must provide more robust qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures. SFAS 161 is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application permitted. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

($.001 per share) F-7 Table of Contents ZHONG SEN INTERNATIONAL TEA COMPANY (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of May 31, 2008 During the period January 30, 2008 (Inception) to May 31, 2008, the Company issued its President and sole Director 730,000 shares of common stock for services valued at $7,300. ($.01 per share). In February 2008 the Company sold a total of 1,500,000 shares for net proceeds of $1,500. ($.001 per share) The Company believes this offering is exempt from registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Company believes this offering is exempt from registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. During the period January 30, 2008 (Inception) to May 31, 2008, the Company issued 120,000 shares of common stock for legal and consulting services. The shares were valued at $1,200 or $.01 per share based on a recent cash offering price. NOTE 5 - GOING CONCERN The Company's financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in the development stage, has an accumulated deficit of $8,570 and used cash in operations of $21,070 from inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management continues to actively seek additional sources of capital to fund current and future operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in continuing to raise additional capital and establish its business model. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. F-8 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section of the Registration Statement includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions. Plan of Operation We have begun limited operations, and we require outside capital to implement our business model. (1) We believe we can begin to implement our plan to provide marketing and sales services to our clients. (2) All functions will be coordinated and managed by our founder, including marketing, finance and operations. (3) We intend to support these marketing efforts through direct marketing, internet sales and word of mouth advertising. (4) Within 90-120 days of the initiation of our marketing campaign, we believe that we will begin to generate business. In summary, we should be generating revenues from services within 180 days of the date of this registration statement. If we are unable to market effectively our premium cigars, we may have to suspend or cease our efforts. If we cease our previously stated efforts, we do not have plans to pursue other business opportunities. Limited Operating History We have generated less than two full years of financial information and have not previously demonstrated that we will be able to expand our business through increased investment marketing. Our business is subject to risks inherent in growing an enterprise with limited capital resources. Future financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue expanding our operations. Equity financing will result in a dilution to existing shareholders. Results of Operations For the period from January 30, 2008 (inception), to May 31, 2008 we had no revenue. Expenses for the period totaled $8,570 resulting in a loss of $8,570. Expenses of $8,570 for the period consisted of $7,300 for Officer’s compensation, $70 for general and administrative expenses and $1,200 for professional fees. Capital Resources and Liquidity As of May 31, 2008 we had $6,300 in cash. We believe that we will need additional funding to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months. Completion of our plan of operation is subject to attaining adequate revenue. We cannot assure investors that additional financing will be available. In the absence of additional financing, we may be unable to proceed with our plan of operations. 13 Table of Contents We anticipate that our operational, and general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months will total approximately $100,000. The foregoing represents our best estimate of our cash needs based on current planning and business conditions. The exact allocation, purposes and timing of any monies raised in subsequent private financings may vary significantly depending upon the exact amount of funds raised and our progress with the execution of our business plan. We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than our payment of expenses incurred or paid by our director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

We were incorporated in the State of Florida in January, 2008 and 70,000 shares were issued to Bruce Trulio as consideration for our incorporation. These shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). These shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a “public offering” as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of shares offered. 18 Table of Contents We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors. In addition, Mr. Trulio had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since he agreed to and received a share certificate bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction. In February 2008 we issued a total 730,000 shares to Bruce Trulio for services rendered to the Company. Such shares were valued at $0.01 per share.
