All references in this prospectus to $ are to U.S. dollars and all references to CAD$ are to Canadian dollars. Our functional currency is the Canadian dollar; we translate our financial information to U.S. dollars as follows: (i) all assets and liabilities have been translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the applicable fiscal period-end and (ii) revenues and expenses have been translated throughout the period at the weighted average exchange rate. Our Company Overview CRAiLAR is focused on bringing sustainable bast fiber-based products to market that are environmentally friendly natural fiber alternatives with equivalent or superior performance characteristics to cotton, wood or fossil-fuel based fibers. Our business operations consist primarily of the production of our natural and proprietary CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers targeted at the natural yarn and textile industries, as well as the deployment of our CRAiLAR ® processing technologies in the cellulose pulp and composites industries. We believe that we offer two key opportunities for development:  CRAiLAR ® fibers (using flax, hemp or other sustainable bast fiber) for textiles (knit, woven and non-woven constructions) available in a variety of blends, textures, colors and applications; and  CRAiLAR ® technologies for processing cellulose-based fibers as a high grade dissolving pulp for use in the additives, ethers and performance apparel markets. We hold the exclusive worldwide license to these patented CRAiLAR ® technologies. We believe that fibers and yarns produced with the CRAiLAR ® process will be competitively priced relative to currently available natural and synthetic fibers and have the benefit of being environmentally responsible. The CRAiLAR ® patented process effectively cleans and polishes raw bast fiber, such as flax, hemp, kenaf and jute bast fibers, into fiber substantially equivalent to ginned cotton. It is our belief that the CRAiLAR ® brand has the potential to become a consumer recognized performance brand that is valued and demanded by the market. We believe that entering into development and supply agreements with some of the worlds largest fiber consuming companies is the best path to successful commercialization of a number of products incorporating our CRAiLAR ® technologies. In execution of this strategy, we have entered into development and supply agreements with companies such as adidas AG, Georgia-Pacific, Hanesbrands Inc., IKEA, Lenzing and Levi Strauss & Co. We have supply agreements with category exclusivity clauses with certain customers that require them to purchase, in the aggregate, approximately 7.4 million pounds of CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers in 2014 and approximately 8.5 million pounds in 2015 (when multi-year requirements are averaged to an annual amount) in order to retain their exclusive rights. Industry With the projected increase in the global population and continued development of market economies, we expect to see a rise in the need for textile fibers worldwide. According to Gherzi, a global management consulting company focused on the textile industry, the global demand for textile fibers is expected to exceed 100 million tons by 2020. Gherzi estimates there were 81.0 million tons of fibers produced globally in 2011 and synthetic fibers (such as polyester) accounted for 59.2% of such fibers, cotton accounted for 33.7%, cellulose-based fibers (such as viscose and rayon) accounted for 5.7% and wool accounted for 1.4% . More generally, according to Gherzi, it is estimated that the demand for textile fibers is expanding approximately 3% per year mainly due to two macroeconomic trends: (i) ongoing population growth and (ii) increase in prosperity which generates additional demand, particularly in emerging economies. In addition, sustainability and climate change concerns are contributing to consumers increasingly preferring products manufactured with a minimal environmental impact and use of resources. 1 We expect our CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber to be cost competitive with other fibers currently available once we have a fully integrated production facility in operation. The CRAiLAR Solution The CRAiLAR ® patented technology and process uses enzymes to effectively clean and polish raw bast fiber, such as flax, hemp, kenaf and jute bast fibers, into fiber substantially equivalent to ginned cotton. This solution is clean, sustainable and environmentally responsible. Bast fiber plants grow abundantly and, when compared with cotton, require 97% less water and substantially less herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides. In April 2012, the USDA designated CRAiLAR as a 100% BioPreferred ® product. As a result of CRAiLARs various innovations, use of flax feedstock and robust water savings, CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers have been recently awarded a B classification (Sustainable) by the MADE-BY organization, a European not-for-profit organization with a mission to improve environmental and social conditions in the fashion industry. This classification certifies that the benefits of CRAiLAR ® Flax, from an environmental impact perspective, far outweigh that of polyester and conventional cotton (both ranked Less Sustainable). The MADE-BY organization and environmental benchmark supports brands and manufacturers in limiting the impact of its materials on the environment and advises them on sustainable alternatives. In this benchmark, the processing of a large range of materials from raw to yarn are compared in relation to emissions produced, their use of land space, pesticides, chemicals, water and energy. The CRAiLAR ® fiber technology was developed by the National Research Council of Canada (the  NRC ). The NRC granted to us the exclusive worldwide license to the patented technology, which currently includes two patents covering the extraction of hemp fibers and preparation of bast fibers. Under development since 2004, this technology has undergone successful final demonstration scale testing and we are now delivering CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber to our customers. We continue to work with the NRC on the development of enhancements to our core technologies that are covered by the NRC license. The license expires upon the expiration of the last patent claim covered by the license, which is currently in December 2029. Products Our products include CRAiLAR ® fiber for the textile market, which is manufactured using a clean, sustainable, environmentally responsible process, and cellulose-based fibers as a high grade dissolving pulp for use in the additives, ethers and performance apparel markets. We are also in the process of investigating by-product opportunities utilizing seed and shive. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that we have a number of strengths that differentiate us and create the foundation for continued sales and profitable growth. All of our fiber products are designed to deliver superior performance. In apparel, we expect CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers will be blended with cotton, resulting in a better performing fabric than cotton alone. When blended at 80% cotton and 20% CRAiLAR ® fibers, the resulting fabric takes on the many superior characteristics of CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers, wicking approximately 50% more moisture when compared to cotton and almost as much moisture as high performance synthetic fibers, reducing shrinkage by up to 50% and requiring up to 10% less dye material. In addition, we offer high quality natural fibers that are an alternative to cotton and pulp users. 2 To lead us to continued sales and profitable growth, we have a proven and experienced senior management team. Our Chief Executive Officer, Ken Barker, has been with us since 2006 and has significant experience in the apparel industry. Many of the other members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the textile industry and with leading consumer brands. Our Business Strategy We believe that our market presence and revenues will continue to expand with the continued development of our growers and customers, allowing the CRAiLAR ® brand to be recognized in a similar fashion to ingredient brand successes such as Gore-Tex ® and Tencel ® . We are pursuing the following growth strategies to continue to build our business:  Further Develop Our Customer Ecosystem. We have established a strong set of relationships with other organizations in our customer ecosystem to deliver superior natural fibers to our customers. We believe these customers will enable us to increase the speed of deployment and functionality of our fibers and offer a wider range of applications to all our customers. We believe that the creation of these relationships is an important strategy and that additional development and supply agreements with consumer brands will also be important for the branding opportunities that these global brands will provide.  Expand Penetration and Consumer Base . We intend to increase the number of consumers who buy our products by using the co-branding opportunities provided by our brand customers, as they communicate our sustainability and performance benefits to their consumers. We plan to support these opportunities with grassroots marketing, social media tools and industry advertising. We plan to continue to invest aggressively in our direct and indirect sales and marketing capabilities to continue to acquire new customers.  Continue Innovation and Broaden Product Offering . Our customers ability to deploy new products rapidly and cost-effectively will be central to our financial results. We intend to continue expanding the functionality of and applications for our products in the future.  Expand Globally . We recognize that our patented technologies have global, multi-industry applications, and represent a significant opportunity for us. We plan to expand our sales capability internationally by expanding our sales force and by collaborating with strategic customers around the world.  Stay True to Our Values . We are a focused business with long-standing core values. We continue to strive to operate in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner. We believe the sustainability and performance of our products and solutions cultivates brand loyalty and trust with customers and helps attract consumers. We plan to work in tandem with our customers to communicate the benefits of CRAiLAR ® fibers through co-branding, ingredient call-outs, co-op marketing efforts and in-store signage.  Invest in Infrastructure and Capabilities . We intend to continue to invest in our people, supply chain and systems to ensure that our business is scalable and profitable. We expect to add new employees to our sales, marketing, operations and finance teams as necessary to support our growth. Additionally, we plan to continue to invest in our systems and technology, to create a platform for growth and to increase efficiency. Production Plan We believe that one of the keys to the successful adoption of CRAiLAR ® fibers into the mainstream textile market is to scale up our in-house production capabilities. In December 2013, we acquired a European fiber dyeing facility with equipment similar to that used to produce CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber. The new plant allowed us to accelerate our timeline for establishing a company-controlled CRAiLAR ® enzyme processing capability. Production of CRAiLAR® fibers at this facility commenced in January 2014. We believe the plant will have the capacity to produce over 280,000 pounds of CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber per week and the space to expand the capacity to over 800,000 pounds per week. We are currently relying on a third party processor to perform one step of the CRAiLAR ® process but have purchased the equipment to perform this step internally. Installation of this equipment and overhauling existing equipment to optimize the plant is currently underway and we expect it to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2014. 3 Raw Materials Flax is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our natural fibers products. Flax is a cost-effective raw material for fiber production because it is easy to grow with minimal use of herbicides and generally requires only regular rainfall for irrigation, which significantly reduces costs as compared to other natural fibers. The European facility is located in an area of flax growing excellence and offers an abundant supply of feedstock from a by-product of the linen industry. Purchasing the by-product of the linen industry has significant working capital advantages because it is bought as needed and is processed, shipped and billed shortly after receipt. This compares with straw purchased directly from farmers for approximately the same cost, but for which a years supply of straw must be paid when harvested by the farmer. We have developed relationships with various European flax processors and brokers to purchase cleaned feedstock. We have also purchased equipment to clean the feedstock for CRAiLAR ® processing that will allow us to buy partially cleaned fiber, providing access to additional sources of feedstock. We expect to have this equipment installed by the end of 2014. We plan to expand our agronomic focus to include multiple North American and international growing regions. We believe the expansion of our growing regions will mitigate climate risk associated with harvests. Sales and Marketing We are pursuing a pull-through marketing model, which focuses on working directly with some of the leading consumer brands in a variety of target markets, including apparel, textiles and industrial products, to develop additional products incorporating our CRAiLAR ® fibers. In this regard, we plan to leverage our partners direct-to-consumer marketing programs to accelerate and expand the brand recognition for our proprietary fibers. Intellectual Property Under the CRAiLAR ® technology platform, we have secured the exclusive worldwide licensing rights to the patented intellectual property arising from our collaborative research agreements with the NRC. The NRC license covers our proprietary processes and includes a license to two patents covering the extraction of hemp fibers and preparation of bast fibers. The patents have been issued or allowed in the U.S., Canada, China, Europe and certain other jurisdictions, and are based on applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The license expires upon the expiration of the last patent claim covered by the license, which is currently in December 2029, but may be terminated earlier by NRC upon our breach of the license agreement or in the event we become bankrupt or insolvent. We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our primary trademark is CRAiLAR ® , which is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in Canada and in several other countries. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, formulations, continuing innovation and other trade secrets, as well as common law trademarks and copyrights, to develop and maintain our competitive position.

You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this prospectus before purchasing our securities. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks. The risks described below are the risks that we believe are material that are facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. Risks Related to Our Business We Have a History of Operating Losses and There Can Be No Assurance We Will Be Profitable in the Future. We have a history of operating losses, expect to continue to incur losses, may never be profitable, and must be considered to be in the development stage. Further, we have been dependent on sales of our equity securities and debt financing to meet our cash requirements. We have incurred net losses totaling approximately $15.2 million for our fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 ( Fiscal 2013 ) and $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 ( Fiscal 2012 ). As of December 28, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of $35.9 million. As of December 28, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 million and a working capital deficit of $3.4 million. We Will Need to Raise Capital to Continue Our Operations. Based upon our historical losses from operations, we anticipate we will require additional funding after the offering. If we cannot obtain capital through additional financings or otherwise, our ability to execute our development plans and achieve profitable operational levels will be greatly limited. Historically, we have funded our operations through the issuance of equity and convertible debentures and bank debt financing arrangements. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, on a timely basis, if at all. Our future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables, including the demand for and market acceptance of CRAiLAR ® technologies. Further, debt financing could lead to a diversion of cash flow to satisfy debt-servicing obligations and create restrictions on business operations. If we are unable to raise additional funds on acceptable terms on a timely basis, it would have a material adverse effect upon our operations. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Has Expressed Doubt about Our Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Our audited financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in light of our continuing net losses and anticipated future operating losses. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financings or other capital, reduce expenditures or attain further operating efficiencies and generate revenue. If adequate funds are not available to us when we need such funds, or if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues, we will be required to curtail our operations, which would, in turn, further raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We May Have Insufficient Earnings or Liquidity to Meet Our Future Debt Obligations. We currently have outstanding convertible debentures and other debt (including a debt repayment obligation relating to our European production facility and a loan from IKEA) in the aggregate principal amount of $22.5 million. The maturity dates of such debt and convertible debentures range from 2016 to 2018. The interest payments on our outstanding debentures and loans are expected to be $1.9 million for each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. Our inability to generate cash flow sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, servicing these debt obligations will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures to continue to expand our business and operations. Our Success Is Dependent upon the Acceptance of CRAiLAR ® Technology. Our success depends upon our achieving significant market acceptance of our CRAiLAR ® technology and products containing our CRAiLAR ® fiber. Acceptance of our CRAiLAR ® technology will depend on the success of our and our customers promotional and marketing efforts and ability to attract customers. If such efforts fail to develop an awareness of and demand for our CRAiLAR ® technology and products, we may never be able to generate any significant future revenues. Even if awareness of our CRAiLAR ® technology increases, we may not be able to timely produce enough of our fibers to meet demand. 7 In addition, the acceptance of our CRAiLAR ® technology may be adversely affected by decreases in the price of cotton. A decrease in the price of cotton could reduce our customers desire for natural fiber alternatives, and thereby reduce the demand for and acceptance of our proprietary fibers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We Are Dependent upon Third Parties to Increase the Awareness of and Demand for Our CRAiLAR ® Fibers and Technology. We are pursuing a pull-through marketing model, which focuses on working directly with some of the leading consumer brands in a variety of target markets to develop additional products incorporating our CRAiLAR ® fibers. To date, we have not spent significant funds on marketing and promotional efforts, but we expect our customers to spend a significant amount on promotion, marketing and advertising of the benefits of our fibers and their products containing such fibers in the future, which we believe will increase awareness of our products. However, we do not currently have any customer agreements which require any significant expenditures to be made by the customer specifically to promote our brand or our products. In addition, we have little control over the actions of our customers with respect to the specific products and quality and number of such products that our customers sell or market that include our CRAiLAR ® fibers, or the relative mix of our fibers in such products, all of which can have an effect on the perception and acceptance of our products. If our customers do not promote and market our products in the future as we expect or their products are not well-accepted in the market or do not effectively demonstrate the benefits of our products and technologies, the acceptance of our brand and products may suffer or we may be required to incur significant additional costs for promotion and marketing, which would adversely affect our financial results and condition. An Early Termination of the NRC License Will Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business. Our CRAiLAR ® technologies are based on patents and other intellectual property licensed to us from the NRC. The license agreement expires upon the expiration of the last patent claim covered by the license, which is currently in December 2029, but may be terminated earlier by the NRC upon our breach of the license agreement or in the event we become bankrupt or insolvent. An early termination of the license agreement would have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business. In addition, due to the substantial dependence of our technologies on the patents held by the NRC, our business and financial results may be adversely affected if such patents are not adequately enforced or protected. Delays or Disruptions in Production of Our Products Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Results. Our business operations consist primarily of, and our revenues are dependent upon, the production and sale of our CRAiLAR® fibers. Currently, we have only one wet processing facility located in Europe for the production of our products. Any delays or disruptions in production at our European facility, whether due to mechanical issues, labor disputes or otherwise, could materially and adversely impact our sales and financial results. Such delays or disruptions that result in an inability to timely meet supply requirements could also have a negative effect on our relationships with our customers and the ultimate acceptance of our products. We may also experience unforeseen quality control issues as we adjust production to meet any changes in demand for our products. In addition, although we plan to make improvements to our decortication facility in South Carolina so that we can resume production at such facility, we cannot assure you that such improvements will be made or that we will ever have full processing capabilities at that facility. A Commercial Market Must Be Found for Our By-products. North American markets need to be found and developed for the by-products of our decortication process. Although several opportunities for the sale of our by-products are being explored, no contracts for the off take of our by-products have been signed as of the date of this prospectus, and we cannot assume that we will enter into any such contracts in the future or that such development will lead to usable products. We May Be Unable to Retain Key Employees or Management Personnel. The loss of any of our key officers and management personnel would have an adverse impact on our future development and could impair our ability to succeed. Our performance is substantially dependent upon the expertise of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kenneth Barker, and our Chief Innovation Officer, Mr. Jason Finnis, and other key management personnel and our ability to continue to hire and retain such personnel. It may be difficult to find sufficiently qualified individuals to replace Messrs. Barker and Finnis or other key management personnel, including Mr. Ted Sanders, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mr. Jay Nalbach, our Chief Marketing Officer, and Mr. Guy Prevost, our Corporate Controller and Compliance Officer, if we lose any one or more of them. The loss of any such persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, development, financial condition, and operating results. We do not maintain key person life insurance on our senior executive officers. 8 Our Officers and Directors May Be Subject to Conflicts of Interest. Certain of our officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest. Such conflicts include deciding how much time to devote to our affairs, as well as what business opportunities should be presented to us. Certain of our directors devote part of their working time to other business endeavors, including consulting relationships with other entities, and have responsibilities to other entities. Because of these relationships, such directors may be subject to conflicts of interest. Currently, we have no policy in place to address such conflicts of interest. However, such directors have acknowledged their fiduciary duty to perform their duties in our best interest and those of our shareholders. Government Regulation and Trade Restrictions Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business. Governments or special interest groups may attempt to protect existing industries through the use of duties, tariffs or public relations campaigns. These efforts may adversely affect interest in and demand for our CRAiLAR ® technology. Moreover, any negative changes to international treaties and regulations such as NAFTA and international trade agreements, and embargoes imposed by entities such as the World Trade Organization, which could result in a rise in trade quotas, duties, taxes and similar impositions or which could limit the countries from whom we can purchase component materials, or which could limit the countries where we or our customers might market and sell products created using CRAiLAR ® technology, could have an adverse effect on our business. The laws, regulations, policies or current administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States or any other jurisdiction may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter our ability to carry on business. The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest groups, may have a detrimental effect on us. Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and/or our profitability. If Our Competitors Misappropriate Unpatented Proprietary Know-How and Our Trade Secrets, It May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business. The loss of or inability to enforce our CRAiLAR ® trademark and our proprietary know-how and trade secrets could adversely affect our business. We depend heavily on trade secrets and the design expertise of our employees. If any of our competitors copy or otherwise gains access to our trade secrets or develops similar technologies or processes independently, we would not be able to compete as effectively. The measures we take to protect our trade secrets and design expertise may not be adequate to prevent their unauthorized use. Further, the laws of foreign countries may provide inadequate protection of such intellectual property rights. We may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. In addition, notwithstanding the rights we have secured in our intellectual property, other persons may bring claims against us that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights or claims that our intellectual property right interests are not valid. Any claims against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Currency Fluctuations May Cause Translation Gains and Losses. A significant portion of our expenses are incurred in Canadian dollars and Euros. As a result, appreciation in the value of these currencies relative to the United States dollar could adversely affect our operating results. Foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against other income for the period incurred. Fluctuations in the value of Canadian dollars and Euros relative to United States dollars may cause currency translation gains and losses. 9 We May Not Successfully Identify or Complete Future Acquisitions, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Cash Flow. We may seek to expand our business partly through acquisitions. However, if any reasonable acquisition candidates were to be identified, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in:  completing acquisitions;  integrating acquired operations into our existing operations; or  expanding into new markets. We also cannot assure you that any current or future acquisitions will not have an adverse effect on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following their completion while we integrate the operations of the acquired business. The integration of newly acquired businesses or operations may prove to be more challenging, take more time than originally anticipated and result in significant additional costs and/or operational issues, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Sales of a Substantial Number of Shares of Our Common Stock May Result in Significant Downward Pressure on the Price of Our Common Stock and Could Affect Your Ability to Realize the Current Trading Price of Our Common Stock. As of March 31, 2014, there were 50,679,097 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Further, as of March 31, 2014, there were outstanding options exercisable for 7,971,799 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.71 per share and warrants exercisable for 8,145,080 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.25 per share. We also completed three offerings of convertible debentures of $10.1 million (CAD$10.0 million), $4.9 million (CAD$5.0 million) and $3.4 million (CAD$3.5 million) on September 20, 2012, February 25, 2013 and July 26, 2013, respectively. Holders of the convertible debentures issued in September 2012 and February 2013 have the option to convert such notes at a price of $2.85 (CAD$2.90) per share of common stock at any time prior to September 30, 2017. Holders of the convertible debentures issued in July 2013 have the option to convert such notes at a price of $1.21 (CAD$1.25) per share of common stock at any time prior to July 26, 2016. Any sales in the public market of the common shares issuable upon exercise or conversion of the outstanding options, warrants and convertible debentures may dilute our stockholders ownership percentages and could result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities. In addition, any significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock as certain stockholders sell their shares of our common stock may encourage short sales. Any such short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock. The Trading Price of Our Common Stock on the OTCQB Has Been and May Continue to Fluctuate Significantly and Stockholders May Have Difficulty Reselling Their Shares. During Fiscal 2013, our common stock has traded as low as $0.36 and as high as $2.63. In addition to volatility associated with OTCQB securities in general, the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock:  changes in the demand for flax and other eco-friendly products;  market acceptance of our products and the products that incorporate our CRAiLAR ® fiber;  disappointing results from our or our customers marketing and sales efforts;  failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;  decline in demand for our common stock; 10  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions;  lack of funding generated for our operations and existing debt obligations;  investor perception of our industry or our business prospects; and  general economic trends. In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile. These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors may be unable to sell their shares at a fair price and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional Issuances of Equity Securities May Result in Dilution to Our Existing Stockholders. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our capital stock to provide additional financing in the future and the issuance of any such shares may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we do issue any such additional shares, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. As a result of such dilution, if you acquire shares of our common stock, your proportionate ownership interest and voting power could be decreased. Further, any such issuances could result in a change of control. We are not authorized to issue shares of preferred stock. However, there are provisions of British Columbia law that permit a companys board of directors, without shareholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of shares of common stock. As a result, shares of preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily, adversely affecting the rights of holders of shares of common stock and could be issued with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult. Although we currently do not have any authorized preferred stock, have no plans to create authorized preferred stock, and have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock, any creation and issuance of preferred stock in the future could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and reduce the value of the common stock. Our Common Stock is Classified as a Penny Stock Under SEC Rules Which Limits the Market for Our Common Stock. Because our stock is not traded on any national securities exchange in the U.S. and because the market price of the common stock is less than $5 per share, the common stock is classified as a penny stock. Our stock has never traded above $5 per share. SEC Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as an established customer or an accredited investor. This includes the requirement that a broker-dealer must make a determination that investments in penny stocks are suitable for the customer and must make special disclosures to the customers concerning the risk of penny stocks. Many broker-dealers decline to participate in penny stock transactions because of the extra requirements imposed on penny stock transactions. Application of the penny stock rules to our common stock reduces the market liquidity of our shares, which in turn affects the ability of holders of our common stock to resell the shares they purchase, and they may not be able to resell at prices at or above the prices they paid. We Are a Canadian Company and a Majority of Our Directors and Many of Our Officers Are Canadian Citizens and/or Residents, Which Could Make It Difficult for Investors to Enforce Judgments Against Us in the United States. We are a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and a majority of our directors and many of our officers reside in Canada. Therefore, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or any of our directors or officers. All or a substantial portion of such persons assets may be located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on our directors or officers, or enforce within the United States or Canada any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. Consequently, you may be effectively prevented from pursuing remedies under U.S. federal securities laws against them. In addition, investors may not be able to commence an action in a Canadian court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. We have been advised by our Canadian counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability, in original actions in Canadian courts, of liability based upon the U.S. federal securities laws and as to the enforceability in Canadian courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Therefore, it may not be possible to enforce those actions against us or any of our directors or officers. 11 A Decline in the Price of Our Common Stock Could Affect Our Ability to Raise Further Working Capital and Adversely Impact Our Operations. A decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise additional capital for our operations. Because our operations to date have been principally financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could have an adverse effect upon our liquidity and our continued operations. A reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future would have a material adverse effect upon our business plan and operations, including our ability to continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, we may not be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements. Such statements include statements regarding our expectations, hopes, beliefs or intentions regarding the future, including but not limited to statements regarding our market, strategy, competition, development plans (including acquisitions and expansion), financing, revenues and operations. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in any such statement. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include the risks described in greater detail in the foregoing Risk Factors section. All forward-looking statements in this document are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.

USE OF PROCEEDS We expect to receive approximately $__ million of net proceeds from the sale of the __ Units offered by us in this offering (or approximately $__ million if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the public offering price of $__ per Unit, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes:  $4.0 million to expand our European wet processing facility and to purchase of additional decortication equipment; and  the remaining amount to fund working capital and for general corporate purposes. Pending their use, we anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities or maintained in interest-bearing accounts. The allocation of the net proceeds of this offering set forth above represents our best estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions and our future revenues and expenditures. If any of these factors change, it may be necessary or advisable for us to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-described categories or to use portions for other purposes. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding application of the net proceeds of this offering. 12 MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Market for Common Stock Our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. since March 21, 2006, initially under the symbol NADVF (until October 31, 2012) and now on the OTCQB under the symbol CRLRF (since November 1, 2012). The market for our common stock is limited, and can be volatile. The following table sets forth the high and low bid prices relating to our common stock on a quarterly basis for the periods indicated as quoted by the OTCQB. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices without retail mark-up, mark-down, or commissions, and may not reflect actual transactions. Quarter Ended High Low March 28, 2014 $ 1.65 $ 0.69 December 28, 2013 1.00 0.42 September 28, 2013 1.27 0.36 June 29, 2013 2.30 0.95 March 30, 2013 2.63 2.05 December 31, 2012 2.71 1.90 September 30, 2012 2.75 2.00 June 30, 2012 3.54 2.39 March 31, 2012 3.58 1.75 In addition, shares of our common stock have been listed on the TSX Venture Exchange ( TSX-V ) since July 8, 2008, initially under the symbol NAT (until October 30, 2012) and now under the symbol CL (since October 31, 2012). The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock on a quarterly basis for the periods indicated as quoted by the TSX-V. Quarter Ended High Low March 28, 2014 CAD$ 1.83 CAD$ 0.73 December 28, 2013 1.10 0.48 September 28, 2013 1.30 0.38 June 29, 2013 2.30 0.99 March 30, 2013 2.76 2.05 December 31, 2012 2.71 1.95 September 30, 2012 2.75 2.01 June 30, 2012 3.50 2.28 March 31, 2012 3.59 1.76 On April 24, 2014, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the OTCQB was $1.15 per share and the last reported sale price of our common stock on the TSX-V was CAD$1.17 per share. Holders As of March 31, 2014, there were 84 holders of record of our common stock as reported by our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services Inc. There were also an undetermined number of holders who hold their stock in nominee or street name. DIVIDEND POLICY No dividends have ever been declared by the Board of Directors on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 13 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents, total debt, and capitalization as of December 28, 2013:  on an actual basis; and  on an as adjusted basis to reflect our receipt of the net proceeds from our sale of Units in this offering at an assumed public offering price of $__ per Unit, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. You should read this table together with Use of Proceeds, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Description of Securities, and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. As of December 28, 2013 Actual As Adjusted (In thousands, except share amounts) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,193 $  Total debt $ 23,504 $  Stockholders deficit: Capital Stock Authorized: 100,000,000 common shares without par value Issued and outstanding: 47,806,031 common shares, actual; __shares as adjusted 34,889  Subscription receivable -  Additional paid-in capital 9,934  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 585  Deficit (11,485 )  Deficit accumulated in the development stage (35,938 )   Total stockholders deficit (2,014 )  Total capitalization $ 22,683 $  A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed public offering price per Unit would increase or decrease our cash and cash equivalents by $__, would increase or decrease additional paid-in capital by $__, and would increase or decrease total stockholders equity and total capitalization by $__, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, any increase or decrease in the number of Units that we sell in the offering will increase or decrease our net proceeds by such increase or decrease, as applicable, multiplied by the offering price per Unit, less underwriting discounts and commissions. DILUTION If you purchase any of the Units offered by this prospectus, you will experience dilution to the extent of the difference between the offering price per Unit you pay in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value per share represents total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. As of December 28, 2013, the net tangible book value of our common stock was approximately $(2.2 million), or approximately $(0.05) per share. After giving effect to our sale of __ Units at the assumed public offering price, deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and applying the net proceeds from this sale, the pro forma net tangible book value of our common stock would have been approximately $__, or $__per share, as of December 28, 2013. This amount represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value to our existing stockholders of $__ per share and an immediate dilution to new investors of $__ per share. 14 The following table illustrates the per share dilution: Assumed public offering price per Unit $ Net tangible book value per share as of December 28, 2013 $ (0.05 ) Increase per share attributable to new investors As adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering Dilution per Share to new investors in this offering $ To the extent that any outstanding options or warrants are exercised, investors will experience further dilution. A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed public offering price of $__ per Unit would increase or decrease, as applicable, our as adjusted net tangible book value per share by $__, and increase or decrease, as applicable, the dilution per Share to new investors by $__, assuming the number of Units offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, any increase or decrease in the number of Units that we sell in the offering will increase or decrease our net proceeds in proportion to such increase or decrease, as applicable, multiplied by the offering price per Unit, less underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All references to dollar amounts in this section are in U.S. dollars unless expressly stated otherwise. The matters discussed in these sections that are not historical or current facts deal with potential future circumstances and developments. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statement regarding our development plans, market trends, anticipated operating expenses, capital requirements and capital resources. As such, these forward-looking statements may include words such as plans, intends, anticipates, should, estimates, expects, believes, indicates, targeting, suggests, and similar expressions. The actual results may differ from these forward-looking statements and these differences may be material. Overview We are focused on bringing sustainable bast fiber-based products to market that are environmentally friendly natural fiber alternatives with equivalent or superior performance characteristics to cotton, wood or fossil-fuel based fibers. Our business operations consist primarily of the production of our natural and proprietary CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers targeted at the natural yarn and textile industries, as well as the deployment of our CRAiLAR ® processing technologies in the cellulose pulp and composites industries. We believe that we offer two key opportunities for development:  CRAiLAR ® fibers (using flax, hemp or other sustainable bast fiber) for textiles (knit, woven and non-woven constructions) available in a variety of blends, textures, colors and applications; and  CRAiLAR ® technologies for processing cellulose-based fibers as a high grade dissolving pulp for use in the additives, ethers and performance apparel markets. Effective in Fiscal 2013, we began to report our first, second, third and fourth quarters on a 4-4-5 basis, with each quarter ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of each third month. In Fiscal 2013, our first quarter ended on March 30, 2013, the second quarter ended on June 29, 2013, the third quarter ended on September 28, 2013 and the fourth quarter ended on December 28, 2013. Acquisition of Production Facility We commenced production of the first stage of the CRAiLAR ® flax fiber process in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013 out of our decortication facility in Pamplico, South Carolina. Following the decortication process, the fibers were converted into Crailar ® Flax fiber at a third party wet processing facility with initial fiber sales beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2013. In December 2013, we acquired a European fiber dyeing facility with equipment similar to that used to produce CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber. The acquisition was made pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 6, 2013, which was amended and restated on December 13, 2013. The new facility allowed us to accelerate our timeline for establishing a company-controlled CRAiLAR ® wet processing capability. Production of CRAiLAR ® fibers at this facility commenced in January 2014. We believe the facility has the capacity to produce over 280,000 pounds of CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber per week with space to expand the capacity to over 800,000 pounds per week. Operations at our decortication facility in South Carolina have been suspended until improvements have been built and installed to the front end of the production line. 15 Debentures On September 20, 2012, we completed the offering of $10.1 million (CAD$10.0 million) worth of convertible debentures (the  September 2012 Debentures ), which bear interest at a rate of 10% per year, payable semi-annually on March 31 and September 30 of each year and mature on September 20, 2017. The holders of the September 2012 Debentures have the option to convert the September 2012 Debentures into shares of our common stock at a price of $2.85 (CAD$2.90) per share for each $972 (CAD$1,000) of principal amount at any time prior to the maturity date. On February 25, 2013, we completed another offering of $4.9 million (CAD$5.0 million) convertible debentures (the  February 2013 Debentures ) with essentially the same terms as the previously mentioned offering. Furthermore, on July 26, 2013, we completed a third offering of $3.4 million (CAD$3.5 million) worth of convertible debentures (the  July 2013 Debentures ) with an interest rate of 10% payable semi-annually on March 31 and September 30 of each year, which mature on July 26, 2016. Originally, the holders of the July 2013 Debentures had the option to convert such debentures into shares of our common stock at a price of $1.94 (CAD$2.00) per share for each $972 (CAD$1,000) of principal amount of debentures at any time prior to the maturity date. However, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Convertible Debenture Indenture dated December 23, 2013, the conversion price for the July 2013 Debentures has been reduced to $1.21 (CAD$1.25) per share of common stock. The holders of the July 2013 Debentures also each received warrants to purchase 800 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.21 (CAD$1.25) per share for each $972 (CAD$1,000) of principal amount of July 2013 Debentures purchased, which warrants are exercisable at any time prior to the maturity date of the debentures. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its five wholly-owned subsidiaries as of December 28, 2013: Crailar Inc., a Nevada incorporated company; Hemptown USA, Inc., a Nevada incorporated company; 0697872 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia incorporated company; Crailar Fiber Technologies Inc., a British Columbia incorporated company, and HTnaturals Apparel Corp, a British Columbia incorporated company. All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and term deposits with original maturities of one year or less at the time of issuance. As of December 28, 2013, the Company had $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory The raw flax fiber feedstock, decorticated fiber and CRAiLAR ® fiber is valued at the lower of cost and market. All direct costs are capitalized to raw flax fiber inventory, decorticated fiber inventory and CRAiLAR ® fiber. Seed inventory is valued at the lower of average cost and market. Cost represents the cost to purchase seed and/or growing cost plus any related shipping costs. Other inventories, which primarily consist of production consumables, are recorded at the lower of cost and replacement cost, which approximates net realizable value. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant areas requiring managements estimates and assumptions are inventory costing and net realizable value, the expected future use and other impairment considerations of property and equipment, fair value of warrants, options, derivative liabilities, provision for income taxes, depreciation and financial instruments. 16 Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated as follows: Automobiles 20% declining balance Computer equipment 30% declining balance Computer software 100% declining balance Equipment 30% declining balance Furniture and fixtures 20% declining balance Production Equipment 30% declining balance Leasehold improvements Term of lease Website development 100% declining balance Depreciation is claimed at one-half of the regular rate in the year of addition. No depreciation is claimed in the year of disposal. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are stated at cost and are amortized as follows: Trademarks 5 year straight - line License Fee 10 year straight - line Patent 10 year straight  line Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement, delivery to the customer has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collectability is considered probable. Foreign Currency Translation  The Companys functional currency is Canadian dollars. The Company translates its financial statements to U.S. dollars using the following method: All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the year-end. Revenues and expenses are translated throughout the year at the weighted average exchange rate. Exchange gains or losses from such translations are included in accumulated comprehensive income (loss), as a separate component of stockholders equity; and  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that potential the future tax assets will not be realized. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss is the change in equity during a period resulting from transactions and other events, other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items of income and expense that are not recognized in net loss as required or permitted by GAAP. Stock-based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to establish the fair-value of stock-based awards. 17 Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents from stock options and warrants were excluded from the calculation of net loss per share for the years ended December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012 as their effect is anti-dilutive. Long-Lived Asset Impairment Long-lived assets of the Company are reviewed when changes in circumstances suggest their carrying value has become impaired. Management considers assets to be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the estimated discounted future projected cash flows to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If impairment is deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a hierarchy of fair value methodologies under GAAP, primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Risk Management Currency risk. The Company is exposed to currency risk to the extent that certain inventory and equipment is purchased from Europe. The purchase price for such inventory and equipment is generally in Euros. The Company does not currently hedge its foreign currency exposure and, accordingly, is at risk for foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The Company and its subsidiaries do not have significant transactions or hold significant cash denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. Credit risk. The risk in cash accounts is managed through the use of a major financial institution, which has high credit quality as determined by the rating agencies. As of December 28, 2013, $158,000, or approximately 71% of receivables, was due from a single customer, and therefore exposed to concentration of credit risk. Interest rate risk. Approximately $1.0 million of the Companys debt bears interest at fluctuating rates. Consequentially the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations. The Company does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk. Commodity price risk. Commodity price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in the market prices of commodities. The Company is exposed to commodity price risk as it purchases fiber feedstock from the flax producers in Europe. The Company purchases the short fiber waste product called tow and the price fluctuates based on supply. The Company has relationships with several short fiber producers and anticipates little issue in obtaining sufficient fiber for its needs. The Company does not currently enter into futures contracts or otherwise hedge its exposure to commodity price risk. Research and Development Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Recent Pronouncements There are no recent pronouncements that are applicable to the Company. 18 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2013 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2012 Fifty-Two Weeks Ended December 31, 2012 December 28, 2013 (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Revenues $ - $ 587 Cost of sales Materials and direct production costs - 470 Facility commissioning costs - 1,897 Depreciation - 681 Impairment loss on inventory - 4,642 - 7,690 Gross profit - (7,103 ) Expenses: Marketing and promotion 672 663 Amortization and depreciation 279 175 General and administrative 6,609 5,681 7,560 6,519 Loss before other items (7,560 ) (13,622 ) Other income (expense): Gain on disposal of assets - 8 Interest (100 ) (2,059 ) Write off of equipment (594 ) (13 ) Research and development (660 ) (355 ) Fair value adjustment derivative liabilities (98 ) 453 Impairment loss on inventory 304 - Bargain purchase - 426 (1,756 ) (1,548 ) Net loss (9,315 ) (15,170 ) Exchange differences on translating to presentation currency (34 ) 1,044 Total comprehensive loss (9,351 ) (14,126 ) Loss per share (basic and diluted) $ (0.22 ) $ (0.34 ) Non-GAAP Financial Measures: EBITDA(1) (8,936 ) (12,255 ) Adjusted EBITDA(1) (5,422 ) (6,322 )  (1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA consists of net income before (a) interest income (expense), net; (b) income tax provision (benefit); (c) amortization of intangibles and impairment loss and (d) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation expense, non- cash write-downs of equipment and inventory, and non-cash rent expense. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income is set forth in the table below under  – Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 19 Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following table reconciles consolidated net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented. Fifty-Two Weeks Ended December 31, 2012 December 28, 2013 (in thousands) Net Loss $ (9,315 ) $ (15,170 ) Interest expense, net 100 2,059 Provision for income taxes - - Depreciation of production property and equipment - 681 Amortization and depreciation 279 175 EBITDA (8,936 ) (12,255 ) Stock-based compensation 2,398 2,005 Impairment loss on inventory 304 4,642 Write off of equipment 594 13 Rent inducement expense 120 152 Fair value adjustment derivative liabilities 98 (453 ) Bargain purchase - (426 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ (5,422 ) $ (6,322 ) Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other provisions of the Exchange Act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We provide EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that consists of net income before (a) interest income (expense), net; (b) income tax provision (benefit); (c) amortization of intangibles and impairment loss and (d) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation expense, non-cash write-downs of equipment and inventory and non-cash rent expense. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides important supplemental information to management and investors. This non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business and results of operations. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our Companys operating performance because it assists in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not directly resulting from core operations. Internally, this non-GAAP measure is also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies; and for evaluating our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of development stage companies. Additionally, we believe that lenders or potential lenders use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ability to repay loans. This non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, we expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from our non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Revenue and Gross Margins In Fiscal 2013, our revenues were derived from sales of CRAiLAR ® fiber, flax seed and other fiber (non-CRAiLAR) at our new European processing facility, and also included customer payments to retain product exclusivity. We did not generate any revenues in Fiscal 2012. 20 Our gross loss for Fiscal 2013 was $(7.1 million), which reflects $4.6 million of feedstock inventory write-downs; $1.9 million of plant pre-commissioning expenses related to our South Carolina facility; $680,839 of related plant depreciation primarily related to our South Carolina facility; and $470,115 of costs directly attributable to higher sales in the current year. The inventory write-down of $4.6 million included the write-down of raw flax fiber feedstock of $2.3 million; flax seed of $1.9 million; CRAiLAR ® fiber of $274,297 and decorticated fiber of $196,861, to net realizable value. The write-down of raw flax fiber feedstock was primarily due to the expected reduced fiber yield from extreme weather conditions. The write-down of seeds was the result of our decision not to plant during the fall of 2013 in North America, and the seed was subsequently sold as lower value oil seed. The write-down of CRAiLAR ® fiber and decorticated fiber was a result of the cost of the fiber exceeding its market price. Pre-commissioning expenses of $1.9 million related to the South Carolina plant incurred from mid January 2013 and ceased at the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013 when production at this plant was suspended. Pre-commissioning expenses that were incurred during the start-up/commissioning period include indirect wages, training, repairs and maintenance, rent, utilities, supplies, equipment rentals, and equipment calibration. Depreciation of production property and equipment for the South Carolina facility during the pre-commissioning period of $680,839 was charged to cost of sales. Operating Expenses During Fiscal 2013, we recorded operating expenses of $6.5 million compared to operating expenses of $7.6 million for Fiscal 2012, a decrease of $1.0 million or 13.8% . The primary cause of the decrease in operating expenses was the reduction in depreciation expense of our pilot scale facility in Kingstree, South Carolina and the reduction in general and administrative expense, primarily stock-based compensation and bonus expense as a result of fewer options vesting during Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012. Marketing and promotion expenses primarily consist of investor and public relation services, and decreased slightly to $663,438 for Fiscal 2013, from $672,305 for Fiscal 2012, a decrease of $8,867 or 1%. General and administrative expenses (G&A) decreased to $5.7 million for Fiscal 2013, from $6.6 million for Fiscal 2012, a decrease of $927,075 or 14%. This decrease was primarily caused by a $608,000 reduction in salaries and consultant expenses due to a decrease in stock-based compensation as a result of fewer options granted and our use of fewer consultants in Fiscal 2013. Also, $319,000 of expenses previously recorded in G&A in Fiscal 2012 is now reported as facility pre-commissioning expense in Fiscal 2013 and was related to our Pamplico, South Carolina facility. These decreases in G&A were partially offset by a $122,000 increase in travel expenses primarily related to travel to and from South Carolina and Europe and a $192,800 increase in professional fees primarily related to legal costs associated with increased business activity. Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of tangible assets decreased to $174,555 for Fiscal 2013 from $278,805 for Fiscal 2012, a decrease of $104,550 or 37%. Depreciation of equipment of the pilot scale facility during Fiscal 2012 that was decommissioned in the third quarter of Fiscal 2012 was the cause of the higher depreciation in Fiscal 2012. Other Items Interest expense increased to $2.1 million for Fiscal 2013, compared to $99,655 for Fiscal 2012, an increase of $1.9 million, resulting from a full years interest on certain convertible debentures issued in 2013 and the issuance of $8.4 million of additional promissory notes in Fiscal 2013. Interest expense is attributable to the convertible debenture interest of $1.5 million, the amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs of $339,000, the accretion expense of $173,000 from the amendment of the July 2013 Debentures, and the accretion expense of $33,000 on the promissory notes conversion feature. Research and development costs decreased to $355,099 for Fiscal 2013, compared to $660,229 for Fiscal 2012, a decrease of $305,130 or 46%, as we transitioned our focus from research and development to commercial production. Write-down of equipment declined to $(13,368) in Fiscal 2013 from $(593,894) in Fiscal 2012, a decrease of $580,526 or 98%, because we wrote down $(593,894) of decortication equipment used in the pilot scale facility that was deemed commercially unviable. The fair value adjustment for derivative liabilities resulted in a gain of $452,845 for Fiscal 2013, compared to a loss of $(98,285) for Fiscal 2012, reflecting a decline in the market value of our stock price. 21 Net Loss Our net loss during Fiscal 2013 was $15.2 million, or $0.34 per share, based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 44,508,011, compared to $9.3 million, or $0.22 per share in Fiscal 2013, based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 43,009,226. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the $4.3 million write-down of raw flax fiber feedstock and seed inventory to reflect lower of cost or market, and $1.9 million of interest expense due to higher borrowings in the current year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES December 28, 2013 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,193 Working capital (3,426 ) Total assets 21,490 Total liabilities 23,504 Shareholders equity (deficit) (2,014 ) The Company has historically relied on equity financings, and more recently from the sale of convertible debentures to fund its operations. On March 20, 2014, the Company completed an equity financing with gross proceeds of $3.1 million. On December 20, 2013, the Company completed an equity financing with gross proceeds of $1.9 million (CAD$2.0 million). On December 19, 2013, but having an effective date of November 29, 2013, we entered into a loan agreement to borrow up to $3.0 million (€2.2 million, approximately CAD$3.2 million). At the end of Fiscal 2013, the Company had not drawn on the loan but as of the date of this prospectus, the Company has drawn $2.2 million (€1.6 million), which was used for capital expenditures for the European processing facility and general working capital. In February 2013, the Company completed a convertible debt financing for gross proceeds of $4.9 million (CAD$5.0 million). In July 2013, the Company completed an additional convertible debt financing for gross proceeds of $3.4 million (CAD$3.5 million). In September 2012, the Company completed a convertible debt financing for gross proceeds of $10.1 million (CAD$10.0 million). The Company expects to fund future operations and expansion from the proceeds of this offering, through bank debt, government loan programs, customer financing, lease programs, additional equity and debt financings, as well as cash generated from operations. Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash flows used in operating activities for Fiscal 2013 were $8.1 million compared with $5.9 million in Fiscal 2012. Cash flows used in operations for Fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of a net loss of $15.2 million offset by the following items: accretion of expense of $127,525 (2012: $0) related to the repricing of warrants associated with the July 2013 debentures; amortization and depreciation of $855,394 (2012: $278,805), which increased in 2013 primarily in connection with the opening of our South Carolina decortication facility; amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of $346,789 (2012: $90,220), which increased in 2013 primarily due to full year charge of issuance costs related to debentures issued in 2012 plus issuance costs of two new debt offerings in 2013; fair value adjustment of derivative liability of $(452,845) (2012: $98,285), which fair value adjustment gain in 2013 related to the expiration of warrants having an exercise price in a currency other than the Companys functional currency; gain on disposal of assets of $(790) (2012: $0); rent of $151,539 (2012: $119,836), which increased in 2013 as the result of entry into a lease with respect to our South Carolina decortication facility during 2012; stock-based compensation of $2.0 million (2012: $2.4 million), which decreased in 2013 primarily due to fewer options vesting in 2013; write off of equipment of $13,368 (2012: $593,894), which was substantially greater in 2012 as result of the write off of equipment at the pilot scale facility in that year; impairment of inventory of $4.6 million (2012: $303,663), which increased significantly in 2013 due to the write down of raw flax fiber feedstock resulting from lower than expected yields due to extreme weather, the write down of seed inventory related to the decision not to plant during fall 2013 and the write down of some decorticated fiber and CRAiLAR ® fiber to market price; bargain purchase of $(425,909) (2012: $0) related to the purchase of the European facility; a decrease (increase) in accounts receivable of $(86,763) (2012: $78,622), which increased in 2013 primarily due to an exclusivity payment due for 2013; an increase in inventory of $(2.7 million) (2012: $(2.2 million)) related to the start of production in 2013 and pre-production in 2012; an (increase) in prepaid expenses of $(184,087) (2012: $(59,538)) primarily related to financing costs; an increase in accounts payable of $971,483 (2012: $1.2 million) associated with the start of production in 2013 and pre-production in 2012; an increase in unearned revenue of $247,655 (2012: $0) due to a pre-payment by a customer; and an increase in accrued liabilities of $709,990 (2012: $521,769) related to inventory purchase, primarily of feedstock inventory. 22 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Fiscal 2013 were $4.0 million, compared to $10.5 million for Fiscal 2012. Cash flows used in investing activities in Fiscal 2013 consisted of sale of equipment of $35,790 (2012: $0); acquisition of property and equipment used for decortication equipment, yard equipment, harvesting equipment and the build out of the South Carolina facility totaling $3.9 million (2012: $10.4 million) and legal expenses with respect to the acquisition of trademarks and licenses totaling $89,306 (2012: $30,268). Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities for Fiscal 2013 totaled $10.2 million compared to $12.9 million during Fiscal 2012. In Fiscal 2013, we issued capital stock and warrants for proceeds of $239,746 (2012: $3.9 million); promissory notes for proceeds of $621,009 (2012: $0); and convertible debentures for net proceeds of $7.4 million (2012: $9.0 million). We also received funds from a private placement for $1.9 million (2012: $0). Effect of Exchange Rate The effect of exchange rates on cash resulted in an unrealized gain of $197,315 for Fiscal 2013, as compared with an unrealized loss of $35,685 in Fiscal 2012. MATERIAL COMMITMENTS Debt Offerings We completed the following three convertible debt offerings in 2012 and 2013: (i) the September 2012 Debentures with gross proceeds of $10.1 million (CAD$10.0 million) on September 20, 2012; (ii) the February 2013 Debentures with gross proceeds of $4.9 million (CAD$5.0 million) on February 25, 2013; and (iii) the July 2013 Debentures with gross proceeds of $3.4 million (CAD$3.5 million) on July 26, 2013. The September 2012 Debentures mature on September 30, 2017 and bear interest at a rate of 10% per year, payable semi-annually on March 31 and September 30 of each year, starting March 31, 2013. The February 2013 Debentures mature on September 30, 2017 and bear interest at a rate of 10% per year, payable semi-annually on March 31 and September 30 of each year, starting on September 30, 2013. The February 2013 Debentures are ranked subordinate to the September 2012 Debentures. Non-Canadian resident holders of the February 2013 Debentures will receive additional interest equal to the amount of the withholding taxes paid by us for Canadian tax purposes. The July 2013 Debentures mature on July 26, 2016 and bear interest at a rate of 10% per year, payable semi-annually on March 31 and September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2013. The July 2013 Debentures are secured by production equipment and fixtures located at our South Carolina facility that are different from the production equipment and fixtures at the South Carolina facility that were used to secure the September 2012 Debentures and the February 2013 Debentures. In the event we complete one or more equity financings between July 26, 2013 and July 26, 2016 with gross proceeds of at least an aggregate of $19.4 million (CAD$20.0 million), we must, subject to providing no less than 60 days prior notice to each holder of the July 2013 Debentures, redeem the July 2013 Debentures in whole at face value plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The initial conversion rates of each of the September 2012 Debentures, the February 2013 Debentures and the July 2013 Debentures were $2.85 (CAD$2.90), $2.85 (CAD$2.90) and $1.94 (CAD$2.00), respectively, and are subject to anti-dilution provisions. Holders of the September 2012 Debentures and the February 2013 Debentures have the option to convert their debentures into common stock at a price of $2.85 (CAD$2.90) per share of common stock at any time prior to their respective maturity date. We may redeem the September 2012 Debentures and the February 2013 Debentures after September 30, 2015 provided that the market price at the time of the redemption notice is not less than 125% of the conversion price. In accordance with the conditions of the IKEA Loan (defined below), we approached the debenture holders (the  Debentureholders ) of the July 2013 Debentures about releasing their security over certain assets held by our subsidiary, CRAiLAR Inc., having an acquisition cost of $1.3 million, which form a portion of the assets securing the July 2013 Debentures pursuant to the Guaranty and Security Agreement (the  Guaranty ) between CRAiLAR Inc. (the  Guarantor ) and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the  Trustee ), dated July 26, 2013, as set forth in Schedule A to the Guaranty, to be used as separate security for the IKEA Loan to us. As consideration for such alteration to the secured assets, the conversion price of the July 2013 Debentures was reduced from $1.94 (CAD$2.00) per share to $1.21 (CAD$1.25) per share. On December 23, 2013, the Trustee and us entered into an Amended and Restated Convertible Debenture Indenture which reflects the modification and alteration of the rights of the Debentureholders and the Trustee against us with respect to (i) the secured assets to now only include those specific assets held by the Guarantor as set forth in Schedule F to the Amended and Restated Convertible Debenture Indenture having an acquisition cost of $3.9 million, and (ii) the reduction of the conversion price of the July 2013 Debentures from $1.94 (CAD$2.00) per share to $1.21 (CAD$1.25) per share. In addition, on the same date, the Guarantor and the Trustee entered into an Amended and Restated Guaranty and Security Agreement, which reflects the modification and alteration with respect to the secured assets as discussed above. 23 Debt On December 1, 2013, we purchased certain assets of a European fiber dyeing facility. We acquired these assets by assuming an aggregate of $1.2 million of the sellers debts, which we have agreed to repay on the earlier of their respective due dates and December 1, 2018. On December 13, 2013, we entered into an amended asset purchase agreement for such assets, which replaced the initial asset purchase agreement and provides that the title to and economic risk in respect of the environmental permit and the employees passed to us on December 1, 2013, however, the title to the equipment at the facility shall only pass to us upon full payment of the foregoing assumed indebtedness of the seller, notwithstanding the fact that physical possession and economic risk of all assets of the acquired facility passed to us on December 1, 2013. We have reached an oral agreement with the seller to lease the real property for the facility and are in the process of formalizing that oral agreement. On December 19, 2013, but having an effective date of November 29, 2013, we entered into a loan agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with IKEA Supply AG ( IKEA ), whereby IKEA agreed to loan us $3.0 million (€2.2 million, approximately CAD$3.2 million) (the  IKEA Loan ) having a term until June 25, 2016 and bearing interest at a rate of 1.9% per annum. As security for the IKEA Loan, IKEA required that the IKEA Loan be secured by assets purchased with the proceeds of the IKEA Loan, as well as a portion of the secured assets used to secure the July 2013 Debentures. The proceeds from the IKEA Loan are designated for the installation of equipment to support and expand our European production facility and for working capital to fulfill IKEA orders. We entered into the following loan arrangements with each of the following directors: Jason Finnis, Kenneth Barker and Robert Edmunds:  Finnis . Pursuant to a convertible promissory note, dated for reference October 11, 2013, Mr. Finnis granted us a loan in the principal amount of $96,290 (CAD$100,000) bearing interest at a rate of 12% per annum and due on December 11, 2013. On November 7, 2013, we repaid to Mr. Finnis $47,885 (CAD$50,000), such that a principal amount of $47,885 (CAD$50,000) remained due and payable on the loan. Pursuant to a loan extension agreement, dated for reference December 18, 2013, Mr. Finnis and we agreed to extend the term for repayment of the loan and interest thereon until the earlier of (i) December 20, 2014 and (ii) such time as we complete our next public offering of registered securities by way of a registration statement on Form S-1 of not less than $2.8 million (CAD$3.0 million) in gross proceeds to us. We repaid this loan and interest thereon in full in April 2014.  Barker . Pursuant to a convertible promissory note, dated for reference October 11, 2013, Mr. Barker granted us a loan in the principal amount of $50,000 bearing interest at a rate of 12% per annum and due and payable on December 11, 2013. Pursuant to a loan extension agreement, dated for reference December 18, 2013, Mr. Barker and we agreed to extend the term for repayment of the loan and interest thereon until the earlier of (i) December 20, 2014 and (ii) such time as we complete our next public offering of registered securities by way of a registration statement on Form S-1 of not less than $2.8 million (CAD$3.0 million) in gross proceeds to us. We repaid this loan and interest thereon in full in April 2014.  Edmunds. Pursuant to demand convertible promissory notes, dated for reference October 11, 2013 and December 4, 2013, respectively, Mr. Edmunds granted us loans in the aggregate principal amount of $523,521 (CAD$545,000) bearing interest at a rate of 20% per annum. Pursuant to a loan extension agreement, dated for reference December 18, 2013, Mr. Edmunds and we agreed to extend the term for repayment of the loan and interest thereon until the earlier of (i) December 20, 2014 and (ii) such time as we complete our next public offering of registered securities by way of a registration statement on Form S-1 of not less than $2.8 million (CAD$3.0 million) in gross proceeds to us. As consideration for the extension, we issued to Mr. Edmunds 181,666 shares of our common stock at a deemed value of $0.56 (CAD$0.60) per share.

The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On March 20, 2014, we completed a private placement equity financing consisting of the sale of 2,515,000 units at $1.25 per unit for gross proceeds of $3.1 million. Each unit consists of one common share and one-half of one transferable common share purchase warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one additional common share of the Company at an exercise price of $1.75 per share for a period of two years from closing (until March 20, 2016). In addition, finders fees of an aggregate of 176,400 common shares were issued to certain finders in conjunction with the closing of this private placement. BUSINESS Overview We are focused on bringing sustainable bast fiber-based products to market that are environmentally friendly natural fiber alternatives with equivalent or superior performance characteristics to cotton, wood or fossil-fuel based fibers. Our business operations consist primarily of the production of our natural and proprietary CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers targeted at the natural yarn and textile industries, as well as the deployment of our CRAiLAR ® processing technologies in the cellulose pulp and composites industries. We believe that we offer two key opportunities for development:  CRAiLAR ® fibers (using flax, hemp or other sustainable bast fiber) for textiles (knit, woven and non-woven constructions) available in a variety of blends, textures, colors and applications; and  CRAiLAR ® technologies for processing cellulose-based fibers as a high grade dissolving pulp for use in the additives, ethers and performance apparel markets. 25 We hold the exclusive worldwide license to the patented CRAiLAR ® technologies. We believe that fibers and yarns produced with the CRAiLAR ® process will be competitively priced relative to current natural and synthetic fibers and have the benefit of being environmentally responsible. The CRAiLAR ® patented process effectively cleans and polishes raw bast fiber, such as flax, hemp, kenaf and jute bast fibers, into fiber substantially equivalent to ginned cotton. It is our belief that the CRAiLAR ® brand has the potential to become a recognized sustainable performance brand that is valued and demanded by the market. We believe that entering into development and supply agreements with some of the worlds largest fiber consuming companies is the best path to successful commercialization of a number of products incorporating our CRAiLAR ® technologies. In execution of this strategy, we have entered into development and supply agreements with companies such as adidas AG, Georgia-Pacific, Hanesbrands Inc., IKEA, Lenzing and Levi Strauss & Co. Our agreements with certain customers contain category exclusivity clauses that require them to purchase, in the aggregate, approximately 7.4 million pounds of CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers in 2014 and approximately 8.5 million pounds in 2015 (when multi-year requirements are averaged to an annual amount) in order to retain their exclusive rights. Corporate Structure and Subsidiaries We were incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, on October 6, 1998, under the name Hemptown Clothing Inc. We changed our name to Naturally Advanced Technologies Inc. effective March 21, 2006. We further changed our name to Crailar Technologies, Inc. effective October 31, 2012. We have six wholly-owned subsidiaries: Crailar Inc., a Nevada corporation; Crailar Fiber Technologies Inc., a British Columbia corporation; HTnaturals Apparel Corp., a British Columbia corporation; 0697872 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia corporation; and Hemptown USA, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and Crailar Europe NV, a Belgian corporation. Industry With the projected increase in the global population and continued development of market economies, we expect to see a rise in the need for textile fibers worldwide. According to Gherzi, a global management consulting company focused on the textile industry, the global demand for textile fibers is expected to exceed 100 million tons by 2020. Gherzi estimates there were 81.0 million tons of fibers produced globally in 2011 and synthetic fibers (such as polyester) accounted for 59.2% of such fibers, cotton accounted for 33.7%, cellulose-based fibers (such as viscose and rayon) accounted for 5.7% and wool accounted for 1.4% . More generally, according to Gherzi, it is estimated that the demand for textile fibers is expanding approximately 3% per year, mainly due to the following two macroeconomic trends:  Ongoing population growth. UNESCO expects the global population to rise from its current total of approximately 7 billion to 7.7 billion people in 2020 when global demand for fibers is expected to exceed 100 million tons.  Increase in prosperity. Increasing prosperity generates additional demand, particularly in emerging economies as they catch up with western industrialized nations. In addition, sustainability and climate change concerns have contributed to consumers increasingly preferring products manufactured with a minimal environmental impact and use of resources. 26 While some of the increase in demand is likely to be filled by synthetic fibers, we believe that the consumer preference for natural fibers will continue to rise, as societal trends to live both sustainably and naturally increase. We believe that we have a unique opportunity to fill this shortfall through the production of CRAiLAR ® fiber. With mill delivered cotton priced between $0.90 and $1.00 per pound, flax is a cost-effective raw material for fiber production. We expect our fiber will be cost competitive with other fibers currently available in the fiber industry once the Company has a fully integrated production facility in operation. The CRAiLAR Solution We hold the exclusive worldwide license to the patented CRAiLAR ® technologies. The CRAiLAR ® patented technologies and processes effectively clean and polish raw bast fiber, such as flax, hemp, kenaf and jute bast fibers, into fiber substantially equivalent to ginned cotton. This solution is clean, sustainable, and environmentally responsible. Bast fiber plants grow abundantly and, when compared with cotton, require 97% less water and substantially less herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides. In April 2012, the USDA designated CRAiLAR as a 100% BioPreferred ® product. CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers have been recently awarded a B classification by the MADE-BY organization. This classification certifies that the benefits of CRAiLAR ® Flax far outweigh that of polyester and conventional cotton (both ranked Less Sustainable). The MADE-BY organization and environmental benchmark supports brands and manufacturers in limiting the impact of its materials on the environment and advises them on sustainable alternatives. In this benchmark, the processing of a large range of materials from raw to yarn are compared in relation to emissions produced, their use of land space, pesticides, chemicals, water and energy. The CRAiLAR ® fiber technology was developed by the NRC. Under development since 2004, this technology is now in successful production with our global partners. We anticipate that CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers will generally be used in union with cotton and all other mainstream fibers, which, when blended together, should result in a much better performing fabric than cotton or other mainstream fibers alone. Products CRAiLAR ® Fiber The CRAiLAR ® fiber technology is a clean, sustainable, environmentally responsible process, which works with bast fiber feedstock. Bast fiber plants grow abundantly generally without excessive water, herbicide, fertilizer and pesticide use. As a result, CRAiLAR ® was designated as a 100% BioPreferred ® product by the USDA in April 2012. In December 2013, CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers were awarded a B classification by the MADE-BY organization, alongside and equal to organic cotton and Lenzing Tencel. 27 Relative to existing bast fiber processing methods, the CRAiLAR ® fiber enzymatic process is significantly faster, produces highly consistent results, and is environmentally low impact. The resulting CRAiLAR ® fibers have characteristics that are superior to traditionally processed bast fibers for textile applications. Because the CRAiLAR ® fiber enzymatic processing is very effective at cleaning bast fiber, it can be spun on traditional cotton equipment at commercially viable speeds. CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers can integrate seamlessly with cotton fibers and, when blended together, results in a superior performing fabric than cotton alone. When blended at 80% cotton and 20% CRAiLAR ® fiber, the resulting fabric takes on many of the superior characteristics of CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers, including enhanced moisture management and comfort, durability, superior dye uptake and garment shrinkage reduction. CRAiLAR ® Shive and Seed Products We are already in the process of investigating by-product opportunities utilizing seed and shive. IKEA has confirmed shive suitably for use in particle board manufacturing for furnishings. We believe we have the potential ability to use the straw of the linseed flax crop, which is primarily cultivated for food and industrial applications. This straw would normally be discarded and/or burned following the seed harvest. Flax shive can be transformed into fuel pellets, animal bedding particle board, molded products and consumer goods packaging while the flax seed can be used for dietary supplements, linseed oil and feed for livestock. Making use of this waste by-product will only further enhance the CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber sustainability rating and could increase potential revenues. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that the following strengths differentiate our company and create the foundation for continued sales and profitable growth: Product Performance. All of our fiber products are designed to deliver superior performance. In apparel, CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers will generally be blended with cotton, which should result in a better performing fabric than cotton alone. When blended at 80% cotton and 20% CRAiLAR ® fibers, the resulting fabric takes on the many characteristics of CRAiLAR ® Flax fibers. Key elements include:  A fiber with wicking characteristics greater than unblended cotton and almost as good as high performance synthetic fibers, making fabrics breathable;  Superior dye uptake resulting in a potential 10% dye reduction for same color specification;  Reduced garment shrinkage of up to 50% from washing compared to unblended cotton; and  Comparable feel of comfort to cotton. Innovative Process. We offer high quality natural fibers that provide an alternative to cotton and high grade dissolving pulp users. We attribute our ability to develop superior products to a number of factors, including:  Intellectual property and patents surrounding the CRAiLAR ® process and technologies;  Close collaboration with our customers to formulate innovative and technically advanced natural fabrics; and  The capital costs involved in building a commercial CRAiLAR ® fibers processing facility have been determined to be relatively modest and we believe we can utilize existing industry equipment. Experienced Management Team. We have a proven and experienced senior management team. Our Chief Executive Officer, Ken Barker, has been with us since 2006 and has significant experience in the apparel industry. Many of the members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the textile industry and with leading consumer brands. 28 Our Business Strategy We believe that our market presence and revenues will continue to expand with the continued development of our growers and customers, allowing the CRAiLAR ® brand to be recognized, similar to ingredient brand successes such as Gore-Tex ® and Tencel ® . We are pursuing the following several growth strategies to continue to build our business: Further Develop Our Customer Ecosystem. We have established a strong set of relationships with other organizations in our customer ecosystem to deliver superior natural fibers to our customers. We believe these customers will enable us to increase the speed of deployment and functionality of our fibers and offer a wider range of applications to our customers. We intend to support our customers in the growth of their products, as well as increase the number of suppliers who work with our customers. We understand that in order for new initiatives to be pulled from corporate concept to market viability, support from senior management of our customers is critical. We have established relationships with large apparel manufacturers and high grade dissolving pulp users such as Hanesbrands and Georgia Pacific. As we expand the commercialization of our fibers, we expect our customers will successfully integrate our CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber within their product categories, but are also discover benefits and enhancements that are exclusive to their developments. This allows the CRAiLAR ® brand to evolve and gain greater brand recognition while servicing both the consumer and customer needs. We believe that the development of customer relationships is an important strategy and that additional relationships with consumer brands will also be important for additional branding opportunities. Expand Penetration and Consumer Base . We intend to increase the number of consumers who buy our products by using the co-branding opportunities provided by our customers, as they communicate our sustainability and performance benefits to their consumers. We plan to further this support with grassroots marketing, social media tools and industry advertising. We believe these efforts will educate consumers about our brand and the benefits of sustainable natural fibers, creating demand for our products and, ultimately, expand our consumer base. We will continue to collaborate with our customers to formulate innovative and technically advanced fibers. We believe that our products can provide significant value to both the consumer and industrial markets. We also believe that there is a substantial opportunity for us to continue to increase the size of our customer base across a broad range of industries, given the relatively high level of performance of our products. We intend to continue to invest aggressively in our direct and indirect sales and marketing capabilities to continue to acquire new customers. Continue Innovation and Broaden Product Offering . Our customers ability to deploy new products rapidly and cost-effectively will be central to our financial results. We intend to continue expanding the functionality of our products in the future. In the near term, we expect that our research and development investments will continue to be highly focused on:  CRAiLAR ® fibers (using flax, hemp or other sustainable bast fiber) for textiles (knit, woven and non-woven constructions) available in a variety of blends, textures, colors and applications; and  CRAiLAR ® technologies for processing of cellulose-based fibers as a high grade dissolving pulp for use in the additives, ethers and performance apparel markets. Over the longer term, we intend to continue our investment in the development of new applications that address additional market opportunities, which may include composites manufacturing, medical, dental and feminine hygiene products. By collaborating with our customers and partners in these efforts, we intend to enable our customers to increase their performance capabilities through rapid and cost-effective deployments of products incorporating our fibers. Expand Globally . We recognize that our patented technologies have global, multi-industry applications, and represent a significant opportunity for us. We plan to expand our sales capabilities internationally by expanding our sales force and by collaborating with strategic customers and partners around the world. Stay True to Our Values . We are a focused business with long-standing core values. We need to rapidly and positively affect the international footprint of dirtier fibers and processes. We continue to strive to operate in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner. We believe our sustainability and performance better cultivates brand loyalty and trust with customers and helps attract consumers. We plan to work in tandem with our customers to communicate the benefits of CRAiLAR ® through co-branding, ingredient call-outs, co-op marketing efforts and in-store signage. Invest in Infrastructure and Capabilities . We invest in our people, supply chain and systems to ensure that our business is scalable and profitable. We expect to add new employees to our sales, marketing, operations and finance teams as necessary to support our growth. Additionally, we continue to invest in our systems and technology, to create a platform for growth and to increase efficiency. 29 Sales and Marketing We are pursuing a pull-through marketing model, which focuses on working directly with some of the leading consumer brands in a variety of target markets, including apparel, textiles and industrial products, to develop additional products incorporating our CRAiLAR ® fibers. In this regard, we plan to leverage our partners direct-to-consumer marketing programs to accelerate and expand the brand recognition for our proprietary fibers. Strategic Relationships/Customer Developments Because CRAiLAR ® fibers can be an ingredient in a broad range of products, we believe that entering into development and supply agreements with large, successful consumer brands is the path to successful commercialization. We believe that these relationships will allow us to leverage the considerable branding and marketing talent of these brands to increase the power of the CRAiLAR ® brand. To grow our business and our brand, we have entered into a number of development and supply agreements including, among others:  adidas AG. In December 2013, adidas AG took a shareholder position in CRAiLAR through their investment arm, Hydra Ventures BV. As one of the largest athletic brands in the world, adidas is a driving force in innovation and performance for athletes and fashionistas alike. CRAiLAR is working in close tandem with adidas to further their development and execution of sustainable production practices, with a goal of reducing the brands dependency on conventional cotton and petro-chemical fibers.  Cone Denim LLC . On March 11, 2013, we entered into a Marketing and Development Agreement with Cone Denim LLC ( Cone ) to market and develop the use of CRAiLAR ® fiber in Cones denim fabric line. We are working directly with Cone and its customer, Levi Strauss & Co., for the development of certain denim products using our CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber. Subject to certain exceptions, CRAiLAR has agreed to not sell CRAiLAR ® fiber to any other denim manufacturer through December 31, 2015 without providing Cone with a right of first refusal on any denim development opportunity. We believe our relationship with Cone and Levi Strauss should expand the demand for our fiber in the denim market.  Cotswold Industries Inc. On February 12, 2013, we entered into a Development Agreement with Cotswold Industries Inc. ( Cotswold ). CRAiLAR and Cotswold will try to develop or create commercially viable pocketing, interlining and waist banding products containing our CRAiLAR ® fibers.  Georgia Pacific Consumer Products LLC . In September 2011, we entered into a three year CRAiLAR ® fiber supply agreement with Georgia Pacific Consumer Products LLC, for the use of CRAiLAR ® fiber in formed substrates for the industrial and personal care markets provided that Georgia Pacific continues to meet annual minimum purchase requirements. Georgia Pacific may automatically extend the agreement for an additional seven years by notifying us at least six months before the expiration of the initial term.  Hanesbrands Inc. In January 2011, we announced a cooperative research project with Hanesbrands Inc. and the U.S. Department of Agricultures Agricultural Research Service designed to cultivate and evaluate the viability of various flax strains for use in CRAiLAR ® technology. In March 2011, we entered into a ten-year CRAiLAR ® fiber supply agreement with Hanesbrands Inc. to commercialize our proprietary fibers. Hanesbrands may terminate the agreement with 180 days advance notice to us, and we can terminate the agreement beginning January 1, 2022 with 180 days advanced notice to Hanesbrands. During the term of the agreement, we may not supply our proprietary fibers to third parties for knit apparel applications.  IKEA. In December 2013, we entered into a general supply agreement and development agreement with IKEA. The general supply agreement provides exclusivity in certain domestic textile categories as long as IKEA meets specified minimum order quantities. The agreement expires on December 31, 2016 but IKEA may extend the term up to two times for three years each by notifying us at least six months before the expiration of the then effective term. We have received orders and have begun flax fiber production at our European production facility. 30  Lenzing AG. In April 2012, we entered into a joint development agreement with Lenzing, headquartered in Austria, and one of the worlds largest suppliers of viscose, Modal and Tencel ® to the apparel, non-woven and auto industries. CRAiLAR and Lenzing are jointly developing fiber solutions in the performance apparel industries for global athletic brands as well as fashion brands.  Target Corp. In November 2011, we entered into an agreement with Target to evaluate the use of our CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber in Targets domestic textiles category beginning December 1, 2011. In connection with this agreement, Target has used our CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber in certain domestic textile products, including in a drapery line. While our agreement with Target has expired, we continue to work with Target in connection with the development of certain woven and knit apparel using our CRAiLAR ® fibers. We are currently evaluating additional opportunities for multiple product development and commercialization of our proprietary CRAiLAR ® technology for environmentally sustainable bast fiber processing and production. Exclusive international licensing rights allow us to protect our investment to date in the development of CRAiLAR ® while confidently moving forward in seeking appropriate development and commercialization relationships. Plan of Operation Production Plan We believe that one of the keys to the successful adoption of CRAiLAR ® fibers into the mainstream textile market is to scale up our in-house production capabilities. In December 2013 we acquired a European fiber dyeing facility with similar equipment used to produce CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber. The acquisition was made pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 6, 2013, which was amended and restated on December 13, 2013. The new plant allowed us to accelerate our timeline for establishing a company-controlled CRAiLAR ® enzyme processing capability. Production of CRAiLAR ® fibers at this plant commenced in January 2014. We believe the plant has the capacity to produce over 280,000 pounds of CRAiLAR ® Flax fiber per week with space to expand the capacity to over 800,000 pounds per week. We are currently relying on a third party processor to perform one step of the CRAiLAR ® process and have purchased the equipment to perform this step internally. Installation of this equipment and overhauling existing equipment to optimize the plant is currently underway and we expect completion by the end of the second quarter of 2014. The facility is located in an area of flax growing excellence and offers an abundant supply of feedstock from a byproduct of the linen industry. Purchasing the by-product of the linen industry has significant working capital advantages because it is bought as needed and is processed, shipped and billed shortly after receipt. This compares with straw purchased directly from farmers for approximately the same cost, but for which a years supply of straw must be paid when harvested by the farmer. We have developed relationships with various European flax processors and brokers to purchase cleaned feedstock. We have also purchased equipment to clean the feedstock for CRAiLAR ® processing that will allow us to buy partially cleaned fiber, providing access to additional sources of feedstock. We expect to have this equipment installed by the end of 2014. We also believe that it is necessary to develop contracted acreage of flax to avoid disrupting supply and demand for by-product of the linen industry. We believe that there are opportunities to secure farm acreage dedicated to supplying our plants. This would require a decortication capability in these growing regions. Our suppliers also believe that additional farmers would be attracted to grow flax for CRAiLAR because the farming techniques are very simple and efficient compared with traditional linen flax farming techniques. Also, the retting requirements for the CRAiLAR ® process are less stringent than for linen flax. We commenced operations in Pamplico, South Carolina in January 2013. We encountered problems with the bale opening system and have suspended operations at that location until new equipment can be built and installed. We do not plan on planting flax in the U.S. this fall given that we have enough supply from the 2013 crop to last through 2014. Also, given our focus on production in Europe, we will have reduced operations in the U.S. until a strategic customer will support our presence in South Carolina. Some of the assets previously used in South Carolina may be redeployed to our European facility. In addition to the installation of our full scale processing line, CRAiLAR continues to improve upon its patented enzymatic process thereby increasing efficiencies. In March 2012, we announced an improvement of our CRAiLAR ® wet process time by 40%, thereby significantly increasing anticipated volume capabilities at planned facilities. The evaluation and resulting improvements were conducted internally in conjunction with research partners. The resulting changes encompass processes, as well as the utilization of industry standard equipment. 31 Production Model Note on Plan of Operation While we expect that profitable operations will be achieved in the future, there can be no assurance that revenue, margins, or profitability will increase, or be sufficient to support operations over the long term. We expect that we will need to raise additional capital to meet short and long-term operating requirements. We may also encounter business endeavors that require significant cash commitments or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities other than to current shareholders, the percentage ownership of current shareholders would be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict business operations. We are continuing to pursue external financing alternatives to improve our working capital position and to grow the business to the greatest possible extent. Raw Materials Flax is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our natural fibers products. Flax is a cost-effective raw material for fiber production because it is generally easy to grow with minimal use of herbicides and requires only regular rainfall for irrigation, which significantly reduces costs as compared to other natural fibers. We have relationships with several European companies to supply feedstock to our European facility. Feedstock is a linen industry waste product or fiber unsuitable for linen due to fiber length. There are significant acres of flax under cultivation in Western Europe for the linen industry as well as in Eastern Europe and Russia, and we believe these regions represent a sufficient source of available feedstock. We have also identified other suitable Eastern European and North American growing regions should we decide to contract directly with farmers in those regions to grow flax. We have developed improved planting and harvesting techniques from our agronomic experience in North America, which should allow us to increase yield per acre and facilitate faster and more cost effective harvesting of flax. 32 Seasonality Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Collaboration and Research Agreements National Research Council of Canada In October 2007, we entered into a joint collaboration agreement with the NRC to continue to develop a patentable enzyme technology for the processing of hemp fibers. The agreement was for three years and initially expired on May 9, 2010. On February 19, 2010, we signed an amendment to the agreement to extend the term of the agreement to May 9, 2012. While this agreement has expired, we continue to work with the NRC on certain enhancements and additions to the NRC technology and negotiations are underway to continue our joint collaboration. De Montfort University In 2011, we entered into a research and development agreement with De Montfort University in Leicester, United Kingdom. De Montforts textile division is renowned for their work on bast fibers such as flax and hemp and specializes in their textile applications. De Montfort has been working on process optimization and works closely with CRAiLARs wet processing partners. In addition to processing improvements, De Montfort has experience with flax and hemp agronomics and has recommended various harvesting improvements that have been implemented into our CRAiLAR ® technologies. Intellectual Property Under the CRAiLAR ® technology platform, we have secured the exclusive worldwide licensing rights to the patented intellectual property arising from our collaborative research agreements with the NRC. The NRC license covers our proprietary processes and includes a license to two patents covering the extraction of hemp fibers and preparation of bast fibers. The patents have been issued or allowed in the U.S., Canada, China, Europe and certain other jurisdictions, and are based on applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. We pay an ongoing royalty of 3% of sales of products derived from the CRAiLAR ® process to the NRC with a minimum annual payment set at $14,750 (CAD$15,000) per year. Once we have reached $44.5 million (CAD$50.0 million) in CRAiLAR ® sales, the royalty percentage drops to 1.5% . The license expires upon the expiration of the last patent claim covered by the license, which is currently in December 2029, but may be terminated earlier by NRC upon our breach of the license agreement or in the event we become bankrupt or insolvent. We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our primary trademark is CRAiLAR ® , which is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in Canada and in several other countries. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, formulations, continuing innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Research and Development We have invested a considerable amount of time and effort into product research and development. Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Our research and development costs for Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 were $355,099 and $660,229, respectively, all of which were attributable to our CRAiLAR ® and related bast fiber technology development. Competition There are relatively few specialty natural bast fibers producers when compared with the much larger cotton and pulp commodity markets. The technical demands and patented processes of CRAiLAR ® differentiates us on the basis of our ability to meet the customers particular set of needs, rather than simply focusing only on pricing alone. 33 Employees CRAiLAR had a total of 22 full-time and two part-time employees as of March 31, 2014 located in the United States, Canada and Europe. Employee relations are considered to be good. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Properties On June 30, 2011, we entered into a lease for our principal offices, consisting of approximately 1,571 square feet of office space in Victoria, British Columbia for a monthly basic net rent of CAD$2,749 (US$2,763 based on the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 of CAD$1.00 = US$1.0051) . The lease is for a term of three years commencing on August 1, 2011 and expires on July 31, 2014 with one renewal term of three years. Effective August 9, 2010, we signed a ten-month sublease of a facility at 164 County Camp Road, Kingstree, South Carolina, at a rental cost of $4,400 per month. We attained the space for use as an initial scale-up flax fiber facility to conduct the decortication process of CRAiLAR ® fibers. The property is housed near 300 acres of flax crops that we used to conduct our flax fiber growing trials. On July 1, 2011, we signed a one year lease, through June 30, 2012, for this same property and facility for a monthly rent of $3,300. Subsequent to June 30, 2012, we agreed to continue to lease the facility for a monthly rent of $3,400 until June 30, 2014. Effective August 15, 2011, we entered into a lease for 1,468 square feet of office space in Lake Oswego, Oregon for a monthly rent of $3,000 during the first year, $3,500 during the second year and $4,000 during the third year. This lease is for a term of three years expiring on August 14, 2014. In March 2012, we entered into a lease for a 147,000 square foot building on 52 acres outside of Pamplico, South Carolina. We plan to use this building as an integrated processing facility, however, problems with the bale opening systems have led operations to be suspended until new equipment can be built and installed. The initial term of the lease is for ten years with two additional five-year extension terms. No rent was due prior to January 1, 2014. Commencing January 1, 2014, the annual basic rent will be $146,930 per year, increasing to $220,395 per year from June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2022. In November 2013, in connection with the acquisition of our European production facility in Ieper, Belgium, we committed to lease the building housing the facility. Pursuant to an oral agreement, the initial term of the lease commitment is ten years with the option to extend the lease for an additional ten-year term. Commencing on December 1, 2013, the annual basic rent will be $62,636 for the first year with annual rent adjustments calculated as the sum of €1,300,000 multiplied by the Belgium risk-free interest rate. After five years the building will be reappraised and the base rents will be calculated using the new appraisal value. Pursuant to the agreement, we have the option to purchase the building for its appraised value after the fifth anniversary. We are currently in the process of formalizing the foregoing oral arrangements. Legal Proceedings Management is not aware of any material pending legal proceedings involving us or our properties. In addition, no director, officer or affiliate is a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings of which we are aware.

The Compensation Committee reviews and makes recommendations regarding compensation issues, in particular:  compensation philosophy and policies;  competitive positioning;  annually review the performance of the CEO, the COO and the CFO on behalf of the Board;  make recommendations to the Board for payment and awards to Senior Officers under the Companys salary and incentive plans;  make recommendations to the Board for annual aggregate incentive compensation payouts to management, including security based compensation arrangements, and profit sharing to employees; and  make recommendations to the Board regarding Director compensation. The Board assumes responsibility for reviewing and monitoring the long-range compensation strategy for our senior management although the Compensation Committee guides it in this role. Our Compensation Committee receives independent competitive market information on compensation levels for executives. It uses salary data of comparable private and public companies as a benchmark for setting executive compensation. This data is obtained from various sources including online research and market surveys. Philosophy and Objectives The compensation program for our senior management is designed to ensure that the level and form of compensation achieves certain objectives, including:  attracting and retaining talented, qualified and effective executives;  motivating the short and long-term performance of these executives; and  better aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. In compensating our senior management, we have employed a combination of base salary, bonus compensation and equity participation through its stock option plan. Base Salary In the Boards view, paying base salaries which are competitive in the markets in which we operate is a first step to attracting and retaining talented, qualified and effective executives. Competitive salary information on comparable companies within the industry is compiled from a variety of sources, including surveys conducted by independent consultants and national and international publications. Bonus Incentive Compensation Our objective is to achieve certain strategic objectives and milestones. The Board will consider executive bonus compensation dependent upon our meeting those strategic objectives and milestones and sufficient cash resources being available for the granting of bonuses. The Board approves executive bonus compensation dependent upon compensation levels based on recommendations of the Compensation Committee, and such recommendations are generally based on survey data provided by independent consultants. Each Named Executive Officer (as defined below) receives a base salary and is also eligible for an annual bonus. Annual bonuses are calculated and approved by the Companys compensation committee on a discretionary basis and can range from 25% to 125% of a Named Executive Officers base salary. 38 Equity Participation We believe that encouraging our executives and employees to become shareholders is the best way of aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. Equity participation is accomplished through our 2011 Fixed Share Option Plan. Stock options are granted to executives and employees taking into account a number of factors, including the amount and term of options previously granted, base salary and bonuses and competitive factors. The amounts and terms of options granted are determined by the Compensation Committee. Given the evolving nature of our business, the Board continues to review and redesign the overall compensation plan for senior management so as to continue to address the objectives identified above. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation Our Compensation Committee is comprised of Jeremy Jones (the committee chair), Robert Edmunds and Lesley Hayes. No person who served as a member of our Compensation Committee during our fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 was a current or former officer or employee of our Company (except that Mr. Edmunds served as our Chief Financial Officer until his resignation from such position on April 27, 2005 and Ms. Hayes served as our Vice President of Communications from December 15, 2000 until February 20, 2004).

Changes in Control We are unaware of any contract, or other arrangement or provision, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of our Company. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS Related Party Transactions Since January 1, 2012, except for the transactions described below and the transactions described in Executive Compensation above, there has not been, nor is there any proposed transaction, where we (or any of our subsidiaries) were or will be a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any director, executive officer or holder of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Effective on October 11, 2013 and December 4, 2013, we issued original Demand Convertible Promissory Notes (collectively, the  Original Edmunds Promissory Notes ) to Mr. Robert Edmunds, one of our directors, pursuant to loans to us in the aggregate principal amount of $523,521 (CAD$545,000) (collectively, the  Edmunds Loan ) bearing interest at a rate of 20% per annum. The Original Edmunds Promissory Notes provided that the Edmunds Loan and the interest thereunder must be repaid by us to Mr. Edmunds on demand. Pursuant to a Loan Extension and Bonus Share Agreement, dated for reference effective on December 18, 2013 (the  Loan Extension ; which together with the Original Edmunds Promissory Notes being, collectively, the  Underlying Edmunds Agreements ), and as a then condition precedent to the completion by us of a private placement with Hydra Ventures BV, which closed on December 20, 2013 (the  Private Placement ) Mr. Edmunds agreed to extend the term for repayment of the Edmunds Loan and the interest under the Original Edmunds Promissory Notes until the earlier of (i) one year from the completion of the Private Placement, and (ii) such time as we complete our next public offering of registered securities by way of a registration statement on Form S-1 of not less than $2.8 million (CAD$3.0 million) in gross proceeds to us (the  New Term of the Edmunds Loan ) and, as additional consideration thereof, subject to TSX-V approval, allot and issue to Mr. Edmunds, as fully paid and non-assessable shares, an aggregate of up to 187,878 shares of our common stock (each a  Bonus Share ), representing a deemed value of 20% of the outstanding balance of the Loan and interest based on an agreed value and deemed issuance price of $0.56 (CAD$0.60) per Bonus Share (the  Bonus Share Issuance ). By letter dated January 20, 2014, the TSX-V approved the final Bonus Share Issuance by us to Mr. Edmunds of 181,666 shares of our common stock at a deemed value of $0.56 (CAD$0.60) per Bonus Share (the  TSX-V Approval ), which shares were issued on January 30, 2014. As a consequence of each of the completion by us of the Private Placement, effective on December 20, 2013, and the receipt of TSX-V Approval to the above-referenced Bonus Share Issuance, the parties agreed to provide for a new Amended And Restated Promissory Note, dated for reference January 21, 2014 (the  Edmunds Amended Promissory Note ), which bears interest at a rate of 20% per annum, and which amended and replaced in their entirety, each of the Underlying Edmunds Agreements. We repaid the Edmunds Loan in full in April 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2012, three directors of the Company advanced a total of $300,000 in loans to the Company on July 27, 2012 having an interest rate of 12% per annum and a maturity date of September 25, 2012. The loans were repaid on September 30, 2012 and the Company paid $5,780 in interest with respect to such loans. Our Board of Directors reviews any proposed transactions involving related parties and considerers whether such transactions are fair and reasonable and in our best interests. 45 UNDERWRITING We have entered into an underwriting agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC with respect to this offering. Subject to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, we have agreed to sell to the underwriter and the underwriter has agreed to purchase the number of Units indicated next to its name in the following table: Underwriter Number of Units Roth Capital Partners, LLC Total  The underwriter is offering the Units subject to their acceptance of the securities from us and subject to prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriter to pay for and accept delivery of the common stock offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by its counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriter is obligated to take and pay for all of the securities, other than securities covered by the over-allotment option described below, if it purchases any such securities. The underwriter has advised us that it proposes to offer the Units to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and to selected dealers at the public offering price less a selling concession not in excess of $__ per Unit. The underwriter also may allow, and selected dealers may re-allow, a concession not in excess of $__ per Unit to brokers and dealers. After the public offering of the securities, the underwriter may change the offering price and other selling terms. The underwriter has informed us that it does not intend to confirm sales to any discretionary accounts without the prior approval of the customer. We have granted the underwriter an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to __ additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriter may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, made in connection with the offering of the securities offered by this prospectus. If the underwriter exercises this option, it will be obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase the number of additional Units indicated in the table above. Discounts and Expenses The following table shows the public offering price and the underwriting discounts to be paid to the underwriter by us. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase additional securities. No Exercise of Full Exercise of Per Unit Over-allotment Option Over-allotment Option Public offering price $ $ $ Underwriting discounts and commissions $ $ $ In addition to the underwriting discounts and commissions, we have agreed to reimburse the underwriter for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them, including fees and disbursements of their counsel and the qualification of the securities offered hereby under applicable state securities laws, with respect to this offering. We estimate that expenses payable by us in connection with the offering of our securities, other than the underwriting discounts and commission and expense reimbursement referred to above, will be approximately $__. Lock-Up Agreements We have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise issue any shares of common stock or securities exchangeable or convertible into common stock for a period of 90 days following the date of this prospectus, without the prior written consent of Roth Capital Partners. Our directors and officers have also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of or hedge any common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock beneficially owned by them for 90 days following the date of this prospectus, without the prior written consent of Roth Capital Partners. If (i) during the last 17 days of the lock-up period, we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us occurs or (ii) prior to the expiration of the lock-up period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the lock-up period, the lock-up period for us, and the persons who have entered into lock-up agreements in connection with this offering, will be extended until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date of issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event. Roth Capital Partners has no present intention to waive or shorten the lock-up period; however, the terms of the lock-up agreements may be waived or shortened at its discretion at any time and without public notice. 46 Indemnification We have agreed to indemnify the underwriter against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the underwriter may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. Price Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids In connection with the offering, the underwriter may engage in stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the underlying security while the offering is in progress. Over-allotment involves syndicate sales of Units in excess of the number of Units to be purchased by the underwriter in the offering, which create a syndicate short position. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of Units in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. Penalty bids permit the underwriter to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the securities originally sold by the syndicate member is purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the common stock, and could cause the price of the security to be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market. The imposition of a penalty bid may also affect the price of a security to the extent it discourages resales of the security. Neither we nor the underwriter make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of shares of our common stock. In addition, neither we nor the underwriter make any representation that the underwriter will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Other Relationships From time to time, the underwriter and its affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these engagements. State Blue Sky Information State securities laws require either that a companys securities be registered for sale or that the securities themselves or the transaction under which they are issued, be exempt from registration. Because our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB and not listed on a national securities exchange, exemptions will generally not be available and this offering must be registered in nearly all states and jurisdictions in which the Units are to be offered or sold. We will apply to register the securities, or will seek to obtain an exemption from registration, only in certain states. In the states that require registration, and in which applications are filed, the Units will not be sold to retail customers until such registration is effective. Institutional investors may purchase the securities to be sold in the offering pursuant to exemptions provided for sales to such entities under the laws of various states. The definition of an institutional investor varies from state to state, but generally includes financial institutions, broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other qualified entities. If you are not an institutional investor, you may purchase the Units in this offering only if you reside in the jurisdictions where there is an effective registration or exemption. 47 We currently file periodic and annual reports under the Exchange Act. Therefore, under the National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 ( NSMIA ), the states and territories of the United States are preempted from requiring registration of resales by holders of shares. However, NSMIA does allow states and territories of the United States to require notice filings and collect fees with regard to these transactions and a state may suspend the offer and sale of securities within such state if any such required filing is not made or fee is not paid. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES Authorized Capital Our authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock without par value. We do not have any authorized shares of preferred stock. Outstanding Capital Stock As of March 31, 2014, we had 50,679,097 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, and we had 84 holders of record of our common stock. In addition, as of March 31, 2014, there were issued and outstanding (i) options to acquire 7,971,799 shares of common stock held by employees, directors, and consultants at a weighted average exercise price of $1.71 per share, (ii) warrants to acquire 8,145,080 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.25 per share, and (iii) convertible debentures currently convertible into 8,000,414 shares of common stock at a weighted average conversion price of $2.10 per share. Common Stock Holders of our common stock are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders, to receive dividends if, as and when declared by the directors and to participate pro rata in any distribution of property or assets upon our liquidation, winding-up or other dissolution. Our common stock carries no pre-emptive rights, conversion or exchange rights, redemption, retraction, repurchase, sinking fund or purchase fund provisions. There are no provisions requiring the holder of common stock to contribute additional capital and no restrictions on the issuance of additional securities by us. There are no restrictions on the repurchase or redemption of common stock by us except to the extent that any such repurchase or redemption would render us insolvent pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). Units We are offering to sell in this offering ____Units, consisting in the aggregate of ____Shares and Warrants to purchase ____Warrant Shares. In addition, we have granted to the underwriters an option to purchase an additional ____Units, consisting in the aggregate of ____Shares and Warrants to purchase ____Warrant Shares. The Shares and the Warrants are immediately separable and will be issued separately. There will be no market for the Units or the Warrants. Warrants to be Issued as Part of a Unit In connection with the purchase of each Unit in this offering, each investor will receive one Share and one Warrant. Each Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase ____Warrant Share at an initial exercise price of $____per Warrant Share (which is ____% of the initial offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus). The Warrants may only be exercised for cash and will expire on ______, 2019 at 5:00 p.m., New York City time. The exercise price and number of Warrant Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including but not limited to in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. The form of the Warrant agreement has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and you should review a copy of the agreement for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the Warrants. The Warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the Warrant on or prior to the expiration date, with the exercise form included with the Warrant completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price, by certified check payable to us or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by us. The holders of Warrants do not have any voting rights or other rights or privileges of holders of common stock until they exercise their Warrants and receive the Warrant Shares. After issuance of Warrant Shares upon exercise of the Warrants, each holder will have the same rights with respect to such Warrant Shares as do all other holders of common stock. 48 No Warrants will be exercisable unless at the time of exercise a prospectus relating to the Warrant Shares is current and the common stock has been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the Warrants. Under the terms of the Warrant agreement, we have agreed to meet these conditions and use our best efforts to maintain a current prospectus relating to Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants until the expiration of the Warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so, and if we do not maintain a current prospectus related to the Warrant Shares, holders will be unable to exercise their Warrants and we will not be required to settle any such Warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to the Warrant Shares is not current or if the common stock is not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the Warrants reside, we will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the Warrant exercise, the Warrants may have no value, the market for the Warrants may be limited and the Warrants may expire worthless. Indemnification of Directors and Officers The corporate laws of British Columbia and Part 21 of our corporate articles allow us to indemnify our directors, former directors, alternate director and their heirs and personal representatives against liability, provided (i) the director or officer was acting on our behalf in his or her official capacity as a director or officer and (ii) such director or officer conducted himself in good faith and believed his conduct was in, or not opposed to, our best interests (or in the case of any criminal proceeding, that he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful). Indemnification permitted by these provisions is limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding upon which liability is predicated, which includes the amount of any such liability actually imposed. In addition, we currently maintain management liability insurance that covers any loss up to a certain amount that our directors and officers may become legally obligated to pay as a result of a claim for a wrongful act for which we do not indemnify the directors and officers, or covers any loss up to a certain amount that we indemnify our directors and officers as a result of a claim for a wrongful act.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS The following is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below) arising from and relating to the acquisition of Units acquired pursuant to this Prospectus, the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Shares acquired as part of the Units, the exercise, disposition, and lapse of Warrants acquired as part of the Units, and the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Warrant Shares. This summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may apply to a U.S. Holder arising from and relating to the acquisition of Units pursuant to this offering, or the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. In addition, this summary does not take into account the individual facts and circumstances of any particular U.S. Holder that may affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences to such U.S. Holder. Accordingly, this summary is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal or U.S. federal income tax advice with respect to any U.S. Holder. Except as discussed below, this summary does not address tax filing and reporting requirements. This summary does not address the U.S. federal alternative minimum, U.S. federal estate and gift, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax consequences to U.S. Holders of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. In addition, except as specifically set forth below, this summary does not discuss applicable income tax reporting requirements. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, U.S. federal alternative minimum, U.S. federal estate and gift, U.S. state and local, and non-U.S. tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. 49 No opinion from legal counsel or ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the  IRS ) has been requested, or will be obtained, regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. This summary is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS is not precluded from taking a position that is different from, and contrary to, the positions taken in this summary. Authorities This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), Treasury Regulations (whether final, temporary, or proposed), published rulings of the IRS, published administrative positions of the IRS, the Convention Between Canada and the United States of America with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, signed September 26, 1980, as amended (the  Canada-U.S. Tax Convention ), and U.S. court decisions that are applicable and, in each case, as in effect and available, as of the date of this document. Any of the authorities on which this summary is based could be changed in a material and adverse manner at any time, and any such change could be applied on a retroactive or prospective basis. This summary does not discuss the potential effects, whether adverse or beneficial, of any proposed legislation that, if enacted, could be applied on a retroactive or prospective basis. U.S. Holders For purposes of this summary, the term  U.S. Holder  means a beneficial owner of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares acquired pursuant to this prospectus that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the U.S.;  a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and one or more U.S. persons has the authority to make all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. Non-U.S. Holders For purposes of this summary, a  non-U.S. Holder  is a beneficial owner of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares that is not a U.S. Holder and is not a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to non-U.S. Holders arising from and relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. Accordingly, a non-U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, U.S. federal alternative minimum, U.S. federal estate and gift, U.S. state and local, and foreign tax consequences (including the potential application of and operation of any income tax treaties) relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. U.S. Holders Subject to Special U.S. Federal Income Tax Rules Not Addressed This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to U.S. Holders that are subject to special provisions under the Code, including but not limited to U.S. Holders that: (a) are tax-exempt organizations or are qualified retirement plans, individual retirement accounts, or other tax-deferred accounts; (b) are financial institutions, underwriters, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, or regulated investment companies; (c) are broker-dealers, dealers, or traders in securities or currencies that elect to apply a mark-to-market accounting method; (d) have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; (e) own Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion transaction, constructive sale, or other arrangement involving more than one position; (f) acquired Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares in connection with the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation for services; (g) hold Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares other than as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes); or (h) own or have owned (directly, indirectly, or by attribution) 10% or more of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company. This summary also does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to U.S. Holders who are: (a) U.S. expatriates or former long-term residents of the U.S.; (b) persons that have been, are, or will be a resident or deemed to be a resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act; (c) persons that use or hold, will use or hold, or that are or will be deemed to use or hold Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares in connection with carrying on a business in Canada; (d) persons whose Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares constitute taxable Canadian property under the Tax Act; or (e) persons that have a permanent establishment in Canada for the purposes of the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention. U.S. Holders that are subject to special provisions under the Code, including but not limited to U.S. Holders described immediately above, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, U.S. federal alternative minimum, U.S. federal estate and gift, U.S. state and local, and non-U.S. tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. 50 If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to such partnership and the partners of such partnership generally will depend on the activities of the partnership and the status of such partners. This summary does not address the tax consequences to any such owner. Partners of entities or arrangements that are classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences arising from and relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Acquisition of Units For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the acquisition by a U.S. Holder of a Unit will be treated as the acquisition of two components: a component consisting of one Share and a component consisting of one Warrant. The purchase price for each Unit will be allocated between these two components in proportion to their relative fair market values at the time the Unit is purchased by the U.S. Holder. This allocation of the purchase price for each Unit will establish a U.S. Holders initial tax basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the one Share and one Warrant that comprise each Unit. For purposes of determining tax basis, the Company will allocate $__ of the purchase price for each Unit to the one Share and $0.01 of the purchase price for each Unit to the one Warrant. However, the IRS will not be bound by the Companys allocation of the purchase price for the Units, and therefore, the IRS or a U.S. court may not respect the allocation set forth above. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the allocation of the purchase price for the Units. U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Exercise and Disposition of Warrants The following discussion is subject to the rules described below under the heading Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules. Exercise of Warrants A U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss on the exercise of a Warrant and related receipt of a Warrant Share (unless cash is received in lieu of the issuance of a fractional Warrant Share). A U.S. Holders initial tax basis in the Warrant Share received on the exercise of a Warrant should be equal to the sum of (a) such U.S. Holders tax basis in such Warrant plus (b) the exercise price paid by such U.S. Holder on the exercise of such Warrant. A U.S. Holders holding period for the Warrant Share received on the exercise of a Warrant should begin on the date that such Warrant is exercised by such U.S. Holder. In certain limited circumstances, a U.S. Holder may be permitted to undertake a cashless exercise of its Warrants into Warrant Shares. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise of Warrants into Warrant Shares is unclear. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a cashless exercise of Warrants. Disposition of Warrants A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Warrant in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (a) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received and (b) such U.S. Holders tax basis in the Warrant sold or otherwise disposed of. Any such gain or loss generally will be a capital gain or loss (provided that the Warrant Share to be issued on the exercise of such Warrant would have been a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code if acquired by the U.S. Holder), which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Warrant is held for more than one year. 51 Expiration of Warrants Without Exercise Upon the lapse or expiration of a Warrant, a U.S. Holder will recognize a loss in an amount equal to such U.S. Holders tax basis in the Warrant. Any such loss generally will be a capital loss and will be long-term capital loss if the Warrants are held for more than one year. Deductions for capital losses are subject to complex limitations under the Code. Certain Adjustments to the Warrants Under Section 305 of the Code, an adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares that will be issued on the exercise of the Warrants, or an adjustment to the exercise price of the Warrants, may be treated as a constructive distribution to a U.S. Holder of the Warrants if, and to the extent that, such adjustment has the effect of increasing such U.S. Holders proportionate interest in the earnings and profits or assets of the Company, depending on the circumstances of such adjustment (for example, if such adjustment is to compensate for a distribution of cash or other property to shareholders of the Company). (See more detailed discussion of the rules applicable to distributions made by the Company at Ownership and Disposition of Shares and Warrant Shares  Taxation of Distributions below). Ownership and Disposition of Shares and Warrant Shares The following discussion is subject to the rules described below under the heading Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules. Taxation of Distributions A U.S. Holder that receives a distribution, including a constructive distribution, with respect to a Share or Warrant Share (as well as any constructive distribution on a Warrant as described above) will be required to include the amount of such distribution in gross income as a dividend (without reduction for any Canadian income tax withheld from such distribution) to the extent of the current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Company, as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent that a distribution exceeds the current and accumulated earnings and profits of the Company, such distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a U.S. Holders tax basis in the Shares or Warrant Shares and thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of such Shares or Warrant Shares (see Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Shares and Warrant Shares below). However, the Company does not currently intend to maintain the calculations of earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, and each U.S. Holder should therefore assume that any distribution by the Company with respect to the Shares (or Warrants) or Warrant Shares (as well as any constructive distribution on a Warrant) will constitute ordinary dividend income. Dividends received on Shares or Warrant Shares generally will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Subject to applicable limitations and provided the Company is eligible for the benefits of the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention, dividends paid by the Company to non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally will be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains for dividends, provided certain holding period and other conditions are satisfied, including that the Company not be classified as a PFIC (as defined below) in the tax year of distribution or in the preceding tax year. The dividend rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the application of such rules. Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Shares and Warrant Shares A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of Shares or Warrant Shares in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (a) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received and (b) such U.S. Holders tax basis in such Shares or Warrant Shares sold or otherwise disposed of. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the sale or other disposition, such Shares or Warrant Shares are held for more than one year. Preferential tax rates apply to long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate, or trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is a corporation. Deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations under the Code. Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules If the Company were to constitute a PFIC for any year during a U.S. Holders holding period, then certain potentially adverse rules would affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder resulting from the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. Based on current business plans and financial expectations, the Company expects that it will not be a PFIC for its current tax year and expects that it will not be a PFIC for the foreseeable future. However, PFIC classification is fundamentally factual in nature, generally cannot be determined until the close of the tax year in question, and is determined annually. Additionally, the analysis depends, in part, on the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the Company has never been, is not, and will not become a PFIC for any tax year during which U.S. Holders hold Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares. 52 In addition, in any year in which the Company is classified as a PFIC, such holder may be required to file an annual report with the IRS containing such information as Treasury Regulations and/or other IRS guidance may require. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the requirements of filing such information returns under these rules, including the requirement to file an IRS Form 8621. The Company will be a PFIC under Section 1297 of the Code if, for a tax year, (a) 75% or more of the gross income of the Company for such tax year is passive income (the  income test ) or (b) 50% or more of the value of the Companys assets either produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income (the  asset test ), based on the quarterly average of the fair market value of such assets. Gross income generally includes all sales revenues less the cost of goods sold, plus income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources, and passive income generally includes, for example, dividends, interest, certain rents and royalties, certain gains from the sale of stock and securities, and certain gains from commodities transactions. In addition, for purposes of the PFIC income test and asset test described above, if the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the total value of the outstanding shares of another corporation, the Company will be treated as if it (a) held a proportionate share of the assets of such other corporation and (b) received directly a proportionate share of the income of such other corporation. In addition, for purposes of the PFIC income test and asset test described above and assuming certain other requirements are met, passive income does not include certain interest, dividends, rents, or royalties that are received or accrued by the Company from a related person (as defined in Section 954(d)(3) of the Code), to the extent such items are properly allocable to the income of such related person that is not passive income and certain other requirements are satisfied. Under certain attribution rules, if the Company is a PFIC, U.S. Holders will be deemed to own their proportionate share of any subsidiary of the Company which is also a PFIC (a  Subsidiary PFIC ), and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on (i) a distribution on the shares of a Subsidiary PFIC or (ii) a disposition of shares of a Subsidiary PFIC, both as if the holder directly held the shares of such Subsidiary PFIC. If the Company were a PFIC in any tax year and a U.S. Holder held Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares, such holder generally would be subject to special rules under Section 1291 of the Code with respect to excess distributions made by the Company on the Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares and with respect to gain from the disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares. An excess distribution generally is defined as the excess of distributions with respect to the Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares received by a U.S Holder in any tax year over 125% of the average annual distributions such U.S. Holder has received from the Company during the shorter of the three preceding tax years, or such U.S. Holders holding period for the Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares, as applicable. Generally, a U.S. Holder would be required to allocate any excess distribution or gain from the disposition of the Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares ratably over its holding period for the Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares. Such amounts allocated to the year of the disposition or excess distribution would be taxed as ordinary income, and amounts allocated to prior tax years would be taxed as ordinary income at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year and an interest charge at a rate applicable to underpayments of tax would apply. While there are U.S. federal income tax elections that sometimes can be made to mitigate these adverse tax consequences (including, without limitation, the QEF Election under Section 1295 of the Code and the Mark-to-Market Election under Section 1296 of the Code), such elections are available in limited circumstances and must be made in a timely manner. Under proposed Treasury Regulations, if a U.S. Holder has an option, warrant, or other right to acquire stock of a PFIC (such as the Warrants), such option, warrant or right is considered to be PFIC stock subject to the default rules of Section 1291 of the Code that apply to excess distributions and dispositions described above. However, for the purposes of the PFIC rules, the holding period for any Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of a Warrant will begin on the date a U.S. Holder acquires the Units (and not the date the Warrants are exercised). This will impact the availability, and consequences, of the QEF Election and Mark-to-Market Election with respect to the Warrant Shares. Thus, a U.S. Holder will have to account for Warrant Shares and Shares under the PFIC rules and the applicable elections differently. In addition, a QEF Election may not be made with respect to the Warrants and it is unclear whether the Mark-to-Market Election may be made with respect to the Warrants. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to the ownership and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants, and Warrant Shares, and the availability of certain U.S. tax elections under the PFIC rules. 53 U.S. Holders should be aware that, for each tax year, if any, that the Company is a PFIC, the Company can provide no assurances that it will satisfy the record keeping requirements of a PFIC, or that it will make available to U.S. Holders the information such U.S. Holders require to make a QEF Election with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary PFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to the ownership and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares, and the availability of certain U.S. tax elections under the PFIC rules. Additional Considerations Additional Tax on Passive Income U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates and certain trusts whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay a 3.8% Medicare surtax on net investment income including, among other things, dividends and net gain from disposition of property (other than property held in certain trades or businesses). U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this tax on their ownership and disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares. Receipt of Foreign Currency The amount of any distribution paid to a U.S. Holder in foreign currency, or on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares, generally will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the exchange rate applicable on the date of receipt (regardless of whether such foreign currency is converted into U.S. dollars at that time). If the foreign currency received is not converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt. Any U.S. Holder who receives payment in foreign currency and engages in a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the foreign currency may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss that would be treated as ordinary income or loss, and generally will be U.S. source income or loss for foreign tax credit purposes. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own U.S. tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of receiving, owning, and disposing of foreign currency. Foreign Tax Credit Subject to the PFIC rules discussed above, a U.S. Holder that pays (whether directly or through withholding) Canadian income tax with respect to dividends paid on the Shares or Warrant Shares (or with respect to any deemed dividend on the Warrants) generally will be entitled, at the election of such U.S. Holder, to receive either a deduction or a credit for such Canadian income tax paid. Generally, a credit will reduce a U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, whereas a deduction will reduce a U.S. Holders income subject to U.S. federal income tax. This election is made on a year-by-year basis and applies to all foreign taxes paid (whether directly or through withholding) by a U.S. Holder during a year. Complex limitations apply to the foreign tax credit, including the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability that such U.S. Holders foreign source taxable income bears to such U.S. Holders worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S. Holders various items of income and deduction must be classified, under complex rules, as either foreign source or U.S. source. Generally, dividends paid by a foreign corporation should be treated as foreign source for this purpose, and gains recognized on the sale of stock of a foreign corporation by a U.S. Holder should be treated as U.S. source for this purpose, except as otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty, and if an election is properly made under the Code. However, the amount of a distribution with respect to the Shares, Warrant Shares or Warrants that is treated as a dividend may be lower for U.S. federal income tax purposes than it is for Canadian federal income tax purposes, resulting in a reduced foreign tax credit allowance to a U.S. Holder. In addition, this limitation is calculated separately with respect to specific categories of income. The foreign tax credit rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should consult its own U.S. tax advisors regarding the foreign tax credit rules. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Under U.S. federal income tax law and Treasury Regulations, certain categories of U.S. Holders must file information returns with respect to their investment in, or involvement in, a foreign corporation. For example, recently enacted legislation generally imposes new U.S. return disclosure obligations (and related penalties) on U.S. Holders that hold certain specified foreign financial assets in excess of certain threshold amounts. The definition of specified foreign financial assets includes not only financial accounts maintained in foreign financial institutions, but also, unless held in accounts maintained by a financial institution, any stock or security issued by a non-U.S. person, any financial instrument or contract held for investment that has an issuer or counterparty other than a U.S. person and any interest in a foreign entity. U.S. Holders may be subject to these reporting requirements unless their Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Penalties for failure to file certain of these information returns are substantial. U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the requirements of filing information returns under these rules, including the requirement to file an IRS Form 8938. 54 Payments made within the U.S. or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, of dividends on, and proceeds arising from the sale or other taxable disposition of, Units, Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares will generally be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax (currently at a rate of 28%), if a U.S. Holder (a) fails to furnish such U.S. Holders correct U.S. taxpayer identification number (generally on Form W-9), (b) furnishes an incorrect U.S. taxpayer identification number, (c) is notified by the IRS that such U.S. Holder has previously failed to properly report items subject to backup withholding tax, or (d) fails to certify, under penalty of perjury, that such U.S. Holder has furnished its correct U.S. taxpayer identification number and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding tax. However, certain exempt persons generally are excluded from these information reporting and backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the U.S. backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or will be refunded, if such U.S. Holder furnishes required information to the IRS in a timely manner. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the information reporting and backup withholding rules. The discussion of reporting requirements set forth above is not intended to constitute an exhaustive description of all reporting requirements that may apply to a U.S. Holder. A failure to satisfy certain reporting requirements may result in an extension of the time period during which the IRS can assess a tax, and under certain circumstances, such an extension may apply to assessments of amounts unrelated to any unsatisfied reporting requirement. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the information reporting and backup withholding rules. MATERIAL CANADIAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS General The following is a general summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable to an investment in the Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares (collectively referred to as the  Securities ) pursuant to this Offering. This summary is based on the facts set out in this prospectus, the current provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the  Tax Act ), the regulations thereunder, all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act and the regulations publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minster of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (the  Proposed Amendments ), and our understanding of the administrative and assessing practices of the Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA ). This summary is not exhaustive of all possible Canadian federal income tax considerations and, except for the Proposed Amendments, does not otherwise take into account any changes in law, whether by legislative, governmental or judicial action, nor does it take into account or consider any provincial, territorial or foreign income tax considerations. The summary assumes that any Proposed Amendments will be enacted as proposed, although there can be no assurance that the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in their current form or at all. This summary is applicable only to investors who acquire Securities pursuant to this Offering and who, for the purposes of the Tax Act and at all relevant times, (i) will hold such Securities as capital property, and (ii) deal at arms length and are not affiliated with the Company. Investors who meet all of the foregoing requirements are referred to as  Investors  in this summary, and this summary only addresses such Investors. In addition, this summary does not extend to Investors that are financial institutions for the purposes of the mark-to-market rules or specified financial institutions, Investors that have made a functional currency election under the Tax Act, Investors that enter into a derivative forward agreement in respect of the Securities, an Investor that is a corporation resident in Canada that is, or becomes as part of a transaction or event or series of transactions or events that includes the acquisition of the Securities, controlled by a non-resident corporation for the purposes of the foreign affiliate dumping rules, or to any Investor an interest in which would be a tax shelter investment (all as used for the purposes of the Tax Act). This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular Investor. All prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to their particular circumstances. 55 Residents of Canada This portion of the summary is applicable to an Investor (as defined above) who, for the purposes of the Tax Act and at all relevant times, is resident or is deemed to be resident in Canada. Such Investors are referred to as  Resident Investors  in this portion of the summary. Allocation of Purchase Price The purchase price of each Unit offered hereby must be allocated, on a reasonable basis, between the Share and the Warrant comprising each Unit in order to determine the respective cost of the Share and the fractional Warrant to the Resident Investor. The Company intends to allocate $__ of the Offering Price for each Unit to the cost of the Share and $0.01 to the cost of the Warrant. Although the Company believes this allocation is reasonable, it is not binding on the CRA or the Investor. The portion of the purchase price of each Unit allocated to the Share and to the Warrant, respectively, will become the Resident Investors cost thereof for purposes of the Tax Act. These amounts must be averaged with the adjusted cost base of all other Shares and Warrants, respectively, held by the Resident Investor as capital property to determine the adjusted cost base of all such Shares and Warrants to the Resident Investor. Exercise of Warrants A Resident Investor will not realize a gain or a loss upon the exercise of a Warrant. When a Warrant is exercised, the Resident Investors cost of the Warrant Share acquired thereby will be equal to the aggregate of the Resident Investors adjusted cost base of the Warrant and the exercise price paid on the exercise of the Warrant. The Resident Investors adjusted cost base of the Warrant Share so acquired will be determined by averaging the cost of the Warrant Share with the Resident Investors adjusted cost base of all Shares held as capital property by the investor immediately before the acquisition of the Warrant Share. Expiry of Warrants The expiry of an unexercised Warrant will generally result in a capital loss to the Resident Investor equal to the adjusted cost base of the Warrant immediately prior to the expiry. The tax treatment of capital losses is described in greater detail below under Treatment of Capital Gains and Capital Losses. Disposition of Shares, Warrants and Warrants Shares A disposition or a deemed disposition by a Resident Investor of a Share, a Warrant (other than on exercise) or a Warrant Share generally will give rise to a capital gain (or a capital loss) in the taxation year of the disposition equal to the amount by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the Resident Investors adjusted cost base of such Share, Warrant or Warrant Share, as the case may be. The tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses is described in greater detail below under Treatment of Capital Gains and Capital Losses. Treatment of Capital Gains and Capital Losses In the year of disposition or deemed disposition, a Resident Investor will be required to include one-half of the amount of any capital gain (a  taxable capital gain ) in income, and will be required to deduct one-half of the amount of any capital loss (an  allowable capital loss ) against any taxable capital gains realized by the Resident Investor. Allowable capital losses not deducted in the taxation year in which they are realized may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation year against taxable capital gains realized in such years, to the extent and under the circumstances specified in the Tax Act. A capital gain realized by a Resident Investor who is an individual (including certain trusts) may give rise to alternative minimum tax. A Canadian-controlled private corporation (as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay an additional 6 2 / 3 % tax (refundable in certain circumstances) on certain investment income, including taxable capital gains. The amount of any capital loss realized on the disposition or deemed disposition of a Share or Warrant Share by a Resident Investor that is a corporation may be reduced by the amount of dividends received or deemed to have been received by it on the Share or Warrant Share to the extent and in the circumstances prescribed by the Tax Act. Similar rules may apply where a Resident Investor that is a corporation is a member of a partnership or is a beneficiary of a trust that owns Shares or Warrant Shares, and where Shares or Warrant Shares are owned by a partnership or trust of which a partnership or trust is a partner or beneficiary. Resident Investors to whom these rules may be relevant should consult their own tax advisors. 56 Dividends Dividends received or deemed to have been received on Shares or Warrant Shares (if any) must be included in computing the Resident Investors income. In the case of a Resident Investor who is an individual, such dividends will generally be subject to the gross-up and dividend tax credit rules applicable to dividends received from taxable Canadian corporations, including the enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit provisions where the Company designates the dividend as an eligible dividend in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Act. There may be limitations on the Companys ability to make such designations, and the Company has not committed to making such designations. A Resident Investor that is a corporation may be entitled to deduct the amount of such dividends in computing the corporations taxable income, subject to all of the restrictions applicable under the Tax Act. A Resident Investor that is a private corporation, as defined in the Tax Act, or any other corporation resident in Canada and controlled by or for the benefit of an individual (other than a trust) or a related group of individuals (other than trusts), will also generally be liable to pay a tax (refundable in certain circumstances) at the rate of 33 1 / 3 % on dividends received (or deemed to have been received) on Shares or Warrant Shares to the extent such dividends are deductible in computing its taxable income. A dividend received by a Resident Investor who is an individual (including certain trusts) may give rise to alternative minimum tax. Eligibility for Investment The Shares and Warrant Shares will be qualified investments under the Tax Act at the time of their acquisition by a trust governed by a registered retirement savings plan ( RRSP ), registered retirement income fund ( RRIF ), deferred profit sharing plan, registered disability savings plan, registered education savings plan or tax-free savings account ( TFSA , and collectively the  Plans ), provided that at such time, such Shares or Warrant Shares are securities that are listed on a designated stock exchange (which includes the TSX-V, Tiers 1 and 2). The Warrants will be qualified investments under the Tax Act at the time of their acquisition by a trust governed by a Plan if (i) the Warrants are listed on a designated stock exchange (which includes the TSX-V, Tiers 1 and 2), or (ii) the Shares are qualified investments and the Company is not an annuitant, a beneficiary, an employer or a subscriber under, or a holder of, the governing Plan and the Company deals at arms length with each person who is an annuitant, a beneficiary, an employer or a subscriber under, or a holder of, the governing Plan. Notwithstanding that the Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares may be qualified investments for a trust governed by a TFSA, RRSP or RRIF, in certain limited circumstances, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares may be prohibited investments (within the meaning of the Tax Act) for a trust governed by a TFSA, RRSP or RRIF. In such case, the holder of a TFSA or the annuitant of a RRSP or RRIF may be subject to a penalty under the Tax Act. Prospective holders who intend to hold Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares in a TFSA, RRSP or RRIF should consult their own tax advisors to ensure that the Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares, as the case may be, that they may acquire will not be a prohibited investment in their particular circumstances. Non-Residents of Canada This portion of the summary is applicable to an Investor (as defined above) who, for the purposes of the Tax Act, and any applicable income tax treaty or convention, and at all relevant times, is not and has never been resident or deemed to be resident in Canada, does not use or hold, and is not deemed to use or hold, Securities in, or in the course of, carrying on business in Canada, and is not an insurer who carries on an insurance business in Canada and elsewhere. Investors who meet all of the foregoing requirements are referred to as  Non-Resident Investors  in this portion of the summary. Allocation of the Purchase Price A Non-Resident Investor will be required to allocate the purchase price of each Unit between the Share and the Warrant in the same manner as described above under Residents of Canada - Allocation of Purchase Price. Exercise of Warrants A Non-Resident Investor will not realize a gain or loss upon the exercise of a Warrant, and will in general terms be subject to the same rules as described above under Residents of Canada  Exercise of Warrants. 57 Disposition of Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares A Non-Resident Investor will be subject to tax under the Tax Act in respect of a disposition or a deemed disposition of Securities only to the extent such Securities constitute taxable Canadian property for purposes of the Tax Act and the Non-Resident Investor is not afforded relief from such tax under an applicable income tax treaty (if any). The Securities generally will not be taxable Canadian property of a Non-Resident Investor at the time of disposition if the Shares and Warrant Shares are listed on a designated stock exchange (which includes the TSX-V, Tiers 1 and 2) at the particular time unless, at any time during the 60-months preceding the time of disposition (i) the Non-Resident Investor, either alone or together with (A) persons with whom the Non-Resident Investor did not deal at arms length (within the meaning of the Tax Act), and (B) pursuant to certain proposed amendments, partnerships in which the Non-Resident Investor or a person described in (A) holds a membership interest directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships, owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of shares of the Company and (ii) more than 50% of the fair market value of the share of the Company was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination of real or immoveable property situated in Canada, Canadian resource properties (as defined in the Tax Act), timber resource properties (as defined in the Tax Act), or an option in respect of or an interest in, or for civil law rights in, such property whether or not such property exists. Securities may also be deemed to be held as taxable Canadian property in certain other circumstances under the Tax Act. A Non-Resident Investor whose Securities are taxable Canadian property (and are not treaty-protected property as defined in the Tax Act) will generally be subject to tax under the Tax Act on a disposition of Securities in the same manner described above under Residents of Canada - Disposition of Shares, Warrants and Warrant Shares and Treatment of Capital Gains and Capital Losses. Non-Resident Investors whose Securities may constitute taxable Canadian property should consult their own tax advisors . Dividends Dividends paid or credited, or which are deemed to have been paid or credited, to a Non-Resident Investor by the Company will be subject to a Canadian non-resident withholding tax of 25%, subject to reduction of such rate under an applicable income tax treaty. Non-Resident Investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax implications of acquiring Units pursuant to this offering in their country of residence and with respect to the application of any bilateral income tax treaty between Canada and that country.

In addition, we currently maintain management liability insurance that covers any loss up to a certain amount that our directors and officers may become legally obligated to pay as a result of a claim for a wrongful act for which we do not indemnify the directors and officers, or covers any loss up to a certain amount that we indemnify our directors and officers as a result of a claim for a wrongful act. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable.

TABLE OF CONTENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-1 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012 F-2 Consolidated Statements of Operations for Years Ended December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the Period from October 1, 2009 to December 28, 2013 F-3 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and for the Period from October 1, 2009 to December 28, 2013 F-4 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity F-6 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements F-18 60 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of CRAiLAR Technologies Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CRAiLAR Technologies Inc. (the Company) (a development stage company) as of December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows and stockholders equity (deficit) for the years ended December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the period from October 1, 2009 (date of re-entry into the development stage) to December 28, 2013. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. A financial statement audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. A financial statement audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the period from October 1, 2009 (date of re-entry into the development stage) to December 28, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses in developing its business, and further losses are anticipated in the future. The Company requires additional funds to meet its obligations and the costs of its operations and there is no assurance that additional financing can be raised when needed. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in this regard are described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ DMCL LLP Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton Labonte LLP CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS Vancouver, Canada March 26, 2014 CRAiLAR Technologies Inc.

F-10 CRAiLAR TECHNOLOGIES INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 28, 2013 (In US Dollars) 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation CRAiLAR Technologies Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the Province of British Columbia, Canada, on October 6, 1998, and is in the business of technological development and of natural sustainable fibers. Effective October 1, 2009, the Company decided to exit the apparel business, which operated under the brand HTnaturals. As a result, the Company re-entered the development stage and has focused on its CRAiLAR ® technology. The Companys shares of common stock trade under the symbol CL, on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) and under the symbol CRLRF on the OTCQB. Going concern The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and payment of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception of $47,422,847 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Accordingly, these factors raise doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. During 2013 the Company raised $2,119,146 from equity funding for capacity expansion and working capital requirements. The Company plans to raise additional financing in 2014 through equity placements for future capacity expansion. However, there can be no assurance that capital will be available or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company. 2. Significant Accounting Policies a) Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its five wholly-owned subsidiaries as of December 28, 2013: Crailar Inc., a Nevada incorporated company; Hemptown USA, Inc., a Nevada incorporated company; 0697872 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia incorporated company; Crailar Fiber Technologies Inc., a British Columbia incorporated company, and HTNaturals Apparel Corp, a British Columbia incorporated company. All inter-company transactions and account balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. b) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and term deposits with original maturities of one year or less at the time of issuance. As at December 28, 2013, the Company held $15,000 (2012 - $20,000) in cash equivalents. c) Inventory The raw flax fiber feedstock, decorticated fiber and Crailar fiber is valued at the lower of cost and market. All direct costs are capitalized to raw flax fiber inventory, decorticated fiber inventory and Crailar fiber. Seed inventory was valued at the lower of average cost and market. Cost comprised the cost to purchase seed and/or growing cost plus any related shipping costs. Other inventories, which consist of production consumables, are recorded at the lower of cost and replacement cost which approximates net realizable value. F-11 CRAiLAR TECHNOLOGIES INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 28, 2013 (In US Dollars) d) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant areas requiring managements estimates and assumptions are inventory costing and net realizable value, the expected future use and other impairment considerations of property and equipment, fair value of warrants, options, derivative liabilities, provision for income taxes, depreciation and financial instruments. e) Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated as follows: Automobiles 20% declining balance Computer equipment 30% declining balance Computer software 100% declining balance Equipment 30% declining balance Furniture and fixtures 20% declining balance Production Equipment 30% declining balance Leasehold improvements Term of lease Website development 100% declining balance Depreciation is claimed at one-half of the regular rate in the year of addition, no depreciation is claimed in the year of disposal. f) Intangible Assets Intangible assets are stated at cost and are amortized as follows: Trademarks 5 year straight - line License Fee 10 year straight - line Patent 10 year straight  line g) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement, delivery to the customer has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collectability is considered probable. h) Foreign Currency Translation The Companys functional currency is Canadian dollars. The Company translates its financial statements to U.S. dollars using the following method: F-12 CRAiLAR TECHNOLOGIES INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 28, 2013 (In US Dollars) All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the year-end. Revenues and expenses are translated throughout the year at the weighted average exchange rate. Exchange gains or losses from such translations are included in accumulated comprehensive income (loss), as a separate component of stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. i) Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that potential the future tax assets will not be realized. j) Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss is the change in equity during a period resulting from transactions and other events, other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. Other comprehensive income (loss) comprises items of income and expenses that are not recognized in net loss as required or permitted by GAAP. k) Stock-based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to establish the fair-value of stock-based awards. l) Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents from stock options and warrants were excluded from the calculation of net loss per share for the years ended December 28, 2013 and December 31, 2012 as their effect is anti-dilutive. m) Long-Lived Asset Impairment Long-lived assets of the Company are reviewed when changes in circumstances suggest their carrying value has become impaired. Management considers assets to be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the estimated discounted future projected cash flows to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If impairment is deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a hierarchy of fair value methodologies under GAAP, primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis. F-13 CRAiLAR TECHNOLOGIES INC. (A Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 28, 2013 (In US Dollars) n) Risk Management Currency risk. The Company is exposed to currency risk to the extent that certain inventory and equipment is purchased from Europe. The purchase price for such inventory and equipment is generally in Euros. The Company does not currently hedge its foreign currency exposure, and accordingly, is at risk for foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The Company and its subsidiaries do not have significant transactions or hold significant cash denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. Credit risk. The risk in cash accounts is managed through the use of a major financial institution, which has high credit quality as determined by the rating agencies. As at December 28, 2013, $158,000 is due from a single customer and therefore 61% of receivables are exposed to concentration of credit risk. Interest rate risk. Approximately $1,026,000 of the Companys debt bears interest at fluctuating rates. Consequentially the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations. The Company does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk. Commodity price risk. Commodity price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in the market prices of commodities. The Company is exposed to commodity price risk as it purchases fiber feedstock from the flax producers in Europe. The Company purchases the short fiber waste product called tow and the price fluctuates based on supply.

We relied on exemptions from registration under the U.S. Securities Act provided by Regulation S based on representations and warranties provided by the purchaser in the subscription agreement entered into between us and the purchaser.

The principal amount of the debentures is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date and the close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the date specified by us for redemption of the debentures.

To file, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to: (a) Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; (b) Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in the volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement. II-9 (c) Include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. 2. That, for determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 3. To remove from registration by means of a post-effective registration statement any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 4. If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 5. That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: (a) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (§230.424 of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations); (b) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; (c) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and (d) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: 6. For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. 7. For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
